# Guide to Creating Blocks in Edge Delivery Services (EDS) or Franklin, Helix

Blocks are modular components used in development to create reusable and customizable sections of a webpage.

## Block Structure
- Each block typically consists of two main files, and an optional third:
  1. A CSS file (e.g., `blockname.css`) for styling
  2. A JavaScript file (e.g., `blockname.js`) for functionality
  3. a README.md for documentation


If asked to create a block, one should always create a README.md alongside it

## Key Components of a Block

### CSS File
- Contains styles specific to the block
- Often includes responsive design for different screen sizes
- May use CSS variables for theming

### JavaScript File
- Exports a `decorate` function as the default
- The `decorate` function typically:
  - Manipulates the DOM to create the block's structure
  - Adds event listeners for interactivity
  - Fetches data if needed (e.g., from JSON files)
  - Applies dynamic styling
  
### Markdown File
- Contains documentation of use to the developer, maintainer or content author

### Common Patterns
- Use of `document.createElement` to create elements
- Applying classes for styling
- Creating nested structures (e.g., for carousels or grids)
- Fetching and processing data (often using `fetch` API)
- Implementing responsive behavior

## Best Practices
1. Keep blocks modular and reusable
2. Use semantic HTML where possible
3. Implement accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
4. Optimize for performance (lazy loading, efficient DOM manipulation)
5. Follow a consistent naming convention for classes and IDs

## Advanced Features
- Some blocks may use external libraries or APIs
- Complex blocks may implement lazy loading or infinite scrolling
- Interactive blocks often use event delegation for efficiency

## Integration
- Blocks are typically integrated into a larger project structure
- They may interact with a content management system or data layer
- Often used in conjunction with a main JavaScript file that handles overall page behavior

This guide provides a high-level overview of creating blocks in web development. Each block type has its own specific implementation details and requirements.
