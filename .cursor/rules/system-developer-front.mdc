Instructions


Edge Delivery Services (EDS) Overview:
EDS is Adobe's serverless platform for fast, scalable web content delivery. Also known as Franklin or Helix. It allows content creators to use familiar tools like Google Docs/Microsoft Word for authoring. The system converts documents to HTML/JSON and serves them via CDN. EDS supports blocks/components for layout and functionality, enabling rapid development and publishing.

Key Components:
1. Document-based authoring
2. Auto-blocking and metadata handling
3. JSON generation from spreadsheets
4. Redirects and configuration options

Development Process:
1. Content Creation:
   - Use Google Docs or Microsoft Word
   - Add metadata tables for page properties
   - Define blocks using tables in the document

2. Preview and Publish:
   - Use Sidekick tool in document
   - Preview generates temporary URL
   - Publish pushes content to production

3. Block Development:
   - Create folder in /blocks with block-name.css and block-name.js files, inside a folder called block-name.  e.g. /blocks/example/example.js and /blocks/example/example.css and /blocks/example/README.md
   - Use vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation
   - Access block content via classes and data attributes, never ID

4. Spreadsheet Usage:
   - Create spreadsheets for dynamic content or configuration
   - System automatically converts to JSON
   - Access via /path/to/spreadsheet.json

5. Advanced Development:
   - Use query-index.json for dynamic content across site
   - Configure headers, redirects, authentication in .helix folder

Block Development Details:
1. CSS:
   - Use CSS3 features including variables
   - Create variations with additional classes

2. JavaScript:
   - Export a default function that decorates the block
   - Use modern browser APIs (fetch, Intersection Observer, etc.)
   - Avoid external libraries to maintain performance

3. HTML Structure:
   - Blocks wrapped in <div class="blockname-wrapper">
   - Inner content in <div class="blockname block">

Best Practices:
1. Performance:
   - Leverage EDS features for optimal page speed
   - Minimize external dependencies
   - Use lazy loading for images and heavy content

2. Modularity:
   - Keep blocks self-contained and reusable
   - Use block variations for different use cases
   - Separate concerns (HTML structure, styling, behavior)

3. Content Author Experience:
   - Make block usage intuitive in documents
   - Provide clear documentation for custom blocks
   - Use sensible defaults with options for customization

4. SEO and Accessibility:
   - Ensure proper heading structure
   - Use semantic HTML elements
   - Provide alt text for images

5. Responsive Design:
   - Design mobile-first, then enhance for larger screens
   - Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
   - Implement responsive images with picture element

Configuration and Advanced Features:
1. .helix folder:
   - Store configuration files (headers, redirects, etc.)
   - Not publicly accessible

2. Spreadsheets and JSON:
   - query-index for site-wide content index
   - Use for dynamic content, site configuration
   - GitHub fallback for spreadsheets

3. Authentication:
   - Configure in .helix/config spreadsheet

4. Redirects:
   - Manage in redirects spreadsheet or GitHub fallback

5. Custom HTTP Headers:
   - Define in headers spreadsheet or GitHub fallback
