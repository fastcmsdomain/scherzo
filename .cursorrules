No time for slow sites
Faster sites, better business
You don’t have the time for slow sites – and neither do your visitors.
Business OwnersSlow sites are not just a bad experience, they are also bad business. Why spend to acquire traffic only to lose the engagement on the site? Improved performance improves business outcomes like conversions, time on site, and order values.
VisitorsPerformance is the number one factor limiting user experience of sites on the web. Performance outranks all other factors including design and content. Slow sites cause users to bounce, leave, and never return.
SEOSlow sites mean most of your audience won’t even see your site. With site performance becoming the most important factor for search engine rankings, this means lost traffic that you need to buy back in ads.
DevelopersMany developers are stuck getting their sites to acceptable performance standards, and great performance seems out of reach. Adobe Experience Manager takes a performance-first approach to delivery, making lighthouse score 100 a reality.
Publish Faster
A CMS that gets out of the way gets your content on the way
Business OwnersBy using the tools your authors already know, you don’t just cut down on time for training and onboarding, you also manage your content in one place. When dealing with structured content, Adobe Experience Manager plays nice with Excel and Google Sheets.
AuthorsAEM takes the unstructured content that you already have, in Word or Google Docs, and turns it into active web experiences. You can use the tools you already know, and all it takes to publish is the press of a button.
DesignersThe content-first approach of AEM turns rigid content modeling chores on its head: the CMS adapts to the content authors create, instead of forcing authors to think in components, structure, and rules of a CMS.
Content OperationsBuilt with the needs of real-world mission-critical sites, AEM cracks the nuts of managing metadata at scale, delivering internationalized and localized content, optimizing for search engines, social sharing, testing, and experimentation.
Develop Faster
Everything modern web development needs, and not a single bit more
Business OwnersWith its lightweight approach to web development, Adobe Experience Manager allows you to go live in weeks, onboard new developers in days, and iterate on changes in minutes. Unlimited preview sites give you confidence that changes will be what you need.
OperationsAEM is one less thing to be on call for. Incredible availability due to fully redundant architecture, endless scalability as a full software as a service and easy integrations with your existing CDN make go-live anxiety a thing of the past.
DevelopersAEM uses all the things modern web developers love: GitHub, local development with auto-reload, performance, simplicity – and none of the complications: no transpilation, no bundlers, no configurations, no overhead.
Quality EngineersAutomated assurance of performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices thanks to built-in quality checks. Continuous assurance of real-world site performance and functionality through real user monitoring.
Benefits
Made to meet your every CMS need and more
Unmatched Speed
The full Adobe Experience Manager stack is optimized for one thing: make your content shine, and make it fast. Delivering at speed is not enough, so we also make it fast to author, publish, and develop.
Content At Scale
From simple sites to ten thousands of pages, AEM handles content at scale, across markets, languages, and countries. And even the biggest sites publish instantly with pushed cache purges.
Uncertainty Eliminated
There’s no place for guesswork in authoring high-performing sites. Each preview generated by AEM offers 100% fidelity, and a unique, easily shareable URL for your reviewers.
Widen the Talent Pool
Using what you already know, is the core of the AEM approach. This means your team can do more with less, requires less training and creates fewer support tickets.
Low Code Productivity
Building great sites does not require complicated frameworks, tooling, or processes. AEM uses plain HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create exceptional experiences without the usual overhead.
Composability is Here
Headless or headful, your content can go farther with AEM’s composable architecture. Deliver the right content in the right format, and add the right decorations to make it an experience that stands out in any channel.
Content First
No matter if structured or unstructured, AEM puts your content first, delivers it optimally and provides your developers with everything they need to make it shine.
Peak Performance
Every great experience starts and ends with performance. Adobe continuously monitors the performance of your AEM site and lets you know when there are ways to improve. All you have to do is approve the pull request.

Using AEM Sidekick
AEM Sidekick provides content authors with a toolbar offering context-aware options so that you can edit, preview, and publish your content directly from the pages of your website.
Installation
The Sidekick is available for Chrome-based browsers (that includes Microsoft Edge). You can install it from the Chrome web store.
Microsoft Edge Installation
To install the Sidekick extension into your Microsoft Edge Browser, you need to enable the following option to "Allow extensions from other stores" under edge://extensions in your URL bar.
Once that setting is enabled the sidekick can be installed from the Chrome web store.
First use of the Sidekick
Once installed, the Sidekick appears as a toolbar hovering over the bottom portion of your content in the browser. If it is not showing, click the Sidekick icon in the browser toolbar. The Sidekick provides you with various tools and actions for navigating and publishing your content.
If your site has authentication for authors enabled, you will first need to click Sign in to authenticate before you can use the Sidekick.
Signing in is not required to use the Sidekick to switch between environments and preview or publish content. However if you wish to unpublish and delete pages, you must sign in.
Using the Sidekick
The Sidekick can be invoked in the following contexts:
Within project environments
A preview URL (the domain name ending in .aem.page)
A live URL (the domain name ending in .aem.live)
A production URL (the domain name being your project’s public host name), custom preview URL, or custom live URL
Note: This requires adding the project to your configuration
A preview URL (the domain name ending in .aem.page)
A live URL (the domain name ending in .aem.live)
A production URL (the domain name being your project’s public host name), custom preview URL, or custom live URL
Note: This requires adding the project to your configuration
Note: This requires adding the project to your configuration
Within online editors (depending on your project setup)
Google Docs/Sheets
Microsoft Word/Excel
Google Docs/Sheets
Microsoft Word/Excel
The Sidekick extension can be toggled by clicking the Adobe Experience Cloud icon next to the address bar in your browser.
Source mode
When using document-based authoring to create content, content moves from the editor through different environments. The environment switcher allows you to easily jump between them.
When editing your document and first using the Sidekick, you default to Source mode. Click the Source button to reveal the additional environments available.
The environment switcher on a Sidekick in Google Docs.
In Source mode, you have the following action available.
Preview (re)generates the preview page based on the current document and opens it in a separate tab.
Preview mode
The preview environment reflects the latest changes of the page rendered from the source document. Preview environments are indicated by a blue label. You can send preview URLs to stakeholders so they can review your content before it gets published. Note that this option is only enabled if the content you are looking at has been previewed before.
The preview URL follows the pattern https://branch--site--org.aem.page/path.
branch, site and org identify the content source and code base to use
/path corresponds to the location of the content in Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint, starting from the root folder.
A / at the end of a path refers to the index document in a folder.
In Preview mode, the following actions are available:
Edit is used to open the content source for editing.
Update is used to force a content refresh.
For example if you have Source and Preview open in side-by-side tabs while working on the content.
The effect is identical to the Preview action in the editor.

Publish makes the current preview version of the page available in the live and production environments.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
If you are previewing a sheet, note that there are additional options available.
Previewing Sheets
Preview mode for sheets works the same as other pages, however there are additional options available that make managing changes to sheets easier for the author. When previewing a page, the preview loads the sheet using the Adobe Experience Manager Sites Data Rendition tool, to show the resulting JSON in a user-friendly way.
Tap or click the X in the banner to close the Data Rendition tool and view the raw JSON.
The preview lazy loads the first 1000 rows. You can search the entirety of the spreadsheet using the Search field.
To visualize what has changed since the last publication, tap or click Show changes.
This creates a diff, showing what has changed in your sheet between the current published state of the sheet and the content you are previewing.
Added lines are in green, prefixed with a plus.
Removed lines are in red, prefixed with a minus.
To show all rows along with the changes, tap or click Show all rows.
Live mode
Live mode is only available if there is no production environment yet. It shows the published content and serves as a stand-in for your project’s production environment. Live environments are indicated by a green label. Note that this option is only enabled if the content you are looking at has been published before.
The live URL looks almost identical to the preview URL, the only difference being in the 1st level domain: https://main--site--org.aem.live/path
In Live mode, the following actions are available:
Edit is used to open the content source for editing.
Publish makes the current preview version of the page available in the live and production environments.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Production mode
Production mode takes you to the production environment, which is your project’s public-facing website. Production environments are indicated by a green label.
This option may not be available during the development stage of your project or because no production environment has been configured yet.
This environment can be a 3rd-party or “bring your own” CDN.
If your public-facing domain name is yourproject.com, the production URL would be https://yourproject.com/path
The following action is available in Production mode:
Publish makes the current preview version of the page available in the live and production environments.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Source
If you are using the Sidekick in the preview, live, or production environments, the source switcher will also offer an Open in option, which opens the online editor of the current page’s source (either a document or the AEM editor) in a separate window.
At a minimum read access to the document in Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint is required to use this action.
Bulk Actions
Open the Sidekick in Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint and select one or more files to bulk preview and publish files and conveniently copy their URLs. The Sidekick counts the number of selected files and prompts you to confirm any bulk actions.
The Sidekick provides a status of ongoing bulk actions.
When the bulk actions are completed successfully, the Sidekick turns green and allows you to copy the URLs of the affected files via the Copy x URLs button or preview them via the Open x URLs button.
If a bulk action fails, it turns red and provides feedback on the failure via the Details button.
You can also use the bulk action feature to preview and publish media files. Adobe continues to extend the support for file formats that can be published directly from your content source (Microsoft SharePoint or Google Drive) based on popular use and security considerations. Currently the supported formats are MP4, PDF, SVG, JPG, PNG. You can learn more about file size limits here.
Limitation: in Microsoft SharePoint, large selections of more than 60 files may not be available to the Sidekick and may therefore need to be split into smaller badges.
Bulk Preview
Selecting multiple documents in Microsoft SharePoint or GDrive allows you to preview multiple documents en masse.
Bulk Publish
Selecting multiple documents in Microsoft SharePoint or GDrive allows you to publish multiple documents en masse. The Sidekick prompts you to confirm before performing bulk actions.
Copy URLs
Use this feature to copy the preview, live or production URLs of one or multiple files.
Unpublishing and Deleting Content
If you no longer require content to be published, you can unpublish it and/or delete it.
Unpublishing content will remove the page from your live and production environments, but still keep it in the preview environment for reference or future republication.
Deleting permanently removes the content from all environments, implicitly unpublishing it.
Unpublishing and deleting content require you to be signed into the Sidekick. You must also have the appropriate roles assigned to your user.
To unpublish you must have the role publish.
To delete you must have either the role publish or author.
Because unpublishing and deleting are not as common as previewing and publishing content, these options are kept behind an ellipsis menu, shown only when appropriate. Navigate to a published page or its preview and click the ellipsis button on the Sidekick to show the Unpublish option.
You can only delete pages from the preview environment. Deletion implicitly unpublishes the page if it has been published before.
Caution: The Delete and Unpublish actions cannot be undone! Double-check the URL and page content to make sure it is really OK to delete and/or unpublish a page.
Due to the finality of deleting pages, you must confirm your deleting by entering DELETE in a dialog.
Adding your project
The Sidekick is able to auto-detect if a URL belongs to your project. If you want the Sidekick to also recognize custom domains, such as your project’s production domain, custom preview domain, or custom live domain, you must add the project to the Sidekick.
This can be done in two ways:
From your source documents
Navigate to any source document associated with your project. Then click the context (≡) menu on the Sidekick and select Add this project.
From your project URL
Navigate to a project URL (similar to https://main--repo--owner.aem.page/) and click the context (≡) menu on the Sidekick and select Add this project.
Removing projects and migration
You can remove projects from the Sidekick by following the same steps, but select Remove this project from the context menu instead.
If you have used a previous version of the Sidekick, you can migrate your previously-configured projects.
Enable both the previous version of the Sidekick and the new version in your browser.
Right-click the Sidekick plugin icon in your browser’s menu bar.
Select Import projects from AEM Sidekick v6 from the context menu.
Managing Projects (Experimental)
Once you have added at least one project to your sidekick, you Then click the context (≡) menu on the Sidekick and select Manage projects to open the Project Admin.
The Project Admin page lists all projects you added to the sidekick.
Each project is listed with:
Convenient links to project resources including
Content location
Preview URL
Production URL (if configured)
Content location
Preview URL
Production URL (if configured)
Edit button to edit the name of the project within the Sidekick or to remove the project from the Sidekick.
Sign in button to sign into the project
A dropdown menu is available from the Sign in button to select which IDP is used for signing in
A dropdown menu is available from the Sign in button to select which IDP is used for signing in
Error Messages
For a complete catalog of error messages appearing in the Sidekick, review Sidekick Errors.
Customizing the Sidekick
If you are a developer, you can customize the Sidekick for your project.

Why I don’t recommend UI testing in AEM (even though I write tests for my own projects)
When customers or partners ask me, “Should we write UI tests for our AEM projects?”, I usually say, “No, probably not.” But here’s the twist: when I’m working on something like Optel Explorer or AEM Sidekick, I write extensive tests.
Sounds contradictory, right?
It’s not. It’s all about understanding the cost-benefit trade-off of testing and most importantly, knowing why we test in the first place.
Let’s start with the basics: Why do we test?
Testing isn’t glamorous but it’s the quiet force behind fast releases, fewer bugs, and happier users. We don’t test just to tick a box; we test to gain confidence. Confidence that our code works, that we can ship faster and that users won’t hit broken experiences in production.
But testing comes at a cost: time, complexity, maintenance, and infrastructure. So the real question becomes: Is the benefit of testing worth the cost in this context?
Think of testing like insurance. You don’t insure everything—you insure what’s valuable and vulnerable. Similarly, in software, we should test where the impact of failure is high and the cost of testing is low.
Let’s bring this to life with two contrasting examples.
Scenario 1: Backend Utility Library
Imagine you're building a backend library that’s used across multiple services. If something breaks here, the consequences are serious. A single bug could ripple across dozens of features. Fortunately, testing this kind of logic is straightforward. It can be done in isolation, without any UI, using fast and reliable unit tests. Since the logic doesn’t change often, the tests remain stable and require minimal upkeep.
In this case, the value of testing is high, and the cost is low. It’s a no-brainer; definitely worth the effort.
Scenario 2: UI Testing in AEM
Now picture writing UI tests for a visual component in AEM. A misaligned button or a slightly off layout might be annoying, but it rarely breaks the user experience. Setting up automated UI tests, however, is anything but simple. Frameworks like Playwright or Web Test Runner require significant setup, and the tests themselves are fragile - small, unrelated changes can cause them to fail. Maintaining them becomes a chore.
Here, the value is low, and the cost is high. In most cases, it’s just not worth it.
Why Any CMS Makes UI Testing Even Harder
Content Management Systems (CMSs) are designed for flexibility, not predictability and that’s exactly what makes UI testing in these environments so challenging.
Components are rendered dynamically based on authored content, which can vary wildly. Different authors structure pages differently, introducing inconsistencies that automated tests struggle with. What works locally might fail in CI/CD due to rendering differences or timing issues.

Getting Started – Developer Tutorial
This tutorial will get you up-and-running with a new Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) project. In ten to twenty minutes, you will have created your own site and be able to create, preview, and publish your own content, styling, and add new blocks.
Prerequisites:
You have a GitHub account, and understand Git basics.
You have a Google account.
You understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You have Node/npm installed for local development.
This tutorial uses macOS, Chrome, and Visual Studio Code as the development environment and the screenshots and instructions reflect that setup. You can use a different operating system, browser, and code editor, but the UI you see and steps you must take may vary accordingly.
To get you to a live website as fast as possible, this tutorial uses Google Drive as the content source. Edge Delivery Services supports multiple content sources including Google Drive, Microsoft Sharepoint, Document Authoring, and AEM Universal Editor.
Get started with the boilerplate repository template
The fastest and easiest way to get started following AEM best practices is to create your repository using the Boilerplate GitHub repository as a template.https://github.com/adobe/aem-boilerplate
Click the Use this template button and select Create a new repository, and select the user org that owns the repository
We recommend that the repository is set to public.
The only remaining step in GitHub is to install the AEM Code Sync GitHub App on your repository by visiting this link: https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync/installations/new
In the Repository access settings of the AEM Code Sync App, make sure you select Only select Repositories (not All Repositories). Then select your newly created repository, and click Save.
Note: If you are using Github Enterprise with IP filtering, you can add the following IP to the allow list: 3.227.118.73
Congratulations! You have a new website running on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/ In the example above that’s https://main--mysite--aemtutorial.aem.page/
Link your own content source using Google Drive
In your fork of the Boilerplate GitHub repository, the site points to an existing content source in Google Drive. See this folder for some example content.
This content is read-only, but it can be copied into your Google Drive folder to serve as a starting point.
To author your own content, create a folder in your own Google Drive and share the folder with the Adobe Experience Manager user (helix@adobe.com).
A good way to start authoring your own content is to copy index, nav and footer from the sample content and familiarize yourself with the content structure. nav and footer are not changed frequently in a project and have a special structure. Most of the files in a project look more similar to index.
Open the files and copy/paste the entire content into corresponding files in your own Google Drive. You can also download the files via Download All or download individual files. However, remember to convert the downloaded .docx files back into native Google Docs, when you upload them to your folder in your Google Drive.
Now that you have your content, you need to connect that content to your GitHub repo. You do this by changing the reference in fstab.yaml in your GitHub repo to the folder you just shared.Copy/paste the folder URL from your Google Drive to fstab.yaml.
Be aware that after you make that change, you will see 404 not found errors as your content has not been previewed yet. Please refer to the next section to see how to start authoring and previewing your content. If you copied over index, nav and footer all three of those are separate documents with their own preview and publish cycles, so make sure you preview (and publish) all of them if needed.
Commit your changes and you have hooked up your own content source to your website.
Preview and publish your content
After completing the last step, your new content source is not empty, but no content has been promoted to the preview or live stages, which means your website serves 404s.To preview content, an author has to install the Sidekick Chrome extension. Find the Chrome extension in the Chrome Web Store.
After adding the extension to Chrome, don’t forget to pin it, this will make it easier to find it.
To set up the Chrome extension, go to your previously shared Google Drive folder and click the extension icon in the browser toolbar and select Add this project.
As soon as the extension is installed and your project is added, you are ready to preview and publish your content from your Google Drive.Select all three docs and activate the AEM Sidekick by clicking on your pinned extension. A new toolbar will appear. Clicking the preview or publish buttons will trigger the corresponding operation.
Open the index doc and make some changes. Activate the Sidekick by clicking on your pinned extension and then click the Preview button which will trigger the preview operation and open a new tab with the preview rendition of the content.
Start developing styling and functionality
To get started with development, it is easiest to install the AEM Command Line Interface (CLI) and clone your repo locally through using the following.
From there change into your project folder and start your local development environment using the following.
This opens http://localhost:3000/ and you are ready to make changes.A good place to start is in the blocks folder which is where most of the styling and code lives for a project. Simply make a change in a .css or .js and you should see the changes in your browser immediately.
Once you are are ready to push your changes, simply use Git to add, commit, and push and your code to your preview (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/) and production (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live/) sites.
That’s it, you made it! Congrats, your first site is up and running. If you need help in the tutorial, please join our Discord channel or get in touch with us.

The Anatomy of a Project
This document describes what a typical project should look like from a code standpoint. Before reading this document, please familiarize yourself with the document Getting Started - Developer Tutorial.
Git and GitHub
One of our defining philosophies is that it is easiest to allow users to work with the tools that they are familiar with. The overwhelming majority of developers manage their code in systems based on Git, so it only makes sense to allow developers to work with Git to manage and deploy their code.
We are using a buildless approach that runs directly from your GitHub repo. After installing the AEM GitHub bot on your repo, websites are automatically created for each of your branches for content preview on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/ and the production site on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live/ for published content.
Every resource that you put into your GitHub repo is available on your website, so a file in your GitHub repo on the main branch in /scripts/scripts.js will be available on https://main--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/scripts/scripts.jsThis should be very intuitive. There are few “special” files that Adobe Experience Manager uses to connect the content into your website.
We strongly recommend that repos are kept public on GitHub, to foster the community. For a public facing website there really is no need to keep the code hidden, as it is being served to the browsers of your website.
Important notes:
The combination <branch>--<repo>--<owner> must not exceed 63 characters (including the hyphens/dashes). This is a subdomain name constraint.
branch, repo and owner cannot contain --.
Configuration Files
There are some files in your GitHub repo that have a special meaning to AEM and are processed in a special fashion. These files are in the root directory of your repo.
The Content Connection: fstab.yaml
As you may have seen in the getting started guide the fstab.yaml file serves as the connection to your Google Drive or SharePoint folders that contain your content. This file is used as an indicator for how the code in your GitHub repo gets combined with the content in your content source.
Beyond providing the connection to the content, the fstab.yaml also provides a folder mapping facility that allows you map extensionless “routes” to a given piece of content or static HTML.
The Entry Point: head.html
The head.html file is the most important extension point to influence the markup of the content. The easiest way to think of it is that this file is injected on the server side as part of the <head> HTML tag and is combined with the metadata coming from the content.
The head.html should remain largely unchanged from the boilerplate and there are only very few legitimate reasons in a regular project to make changes. Those include remapping your project to a different base URL for the purposes of exposing your project in a different folder than the root folder of your domain on your CDN or to support legacy browsers which usually require scripts that are not loaded as modules.
Adding marketing technology like Adobe Web SDK, Google Tag Manager or other 3rd party scripts to your head.html file is strongly advised against due to performance impacts. Adding inline scripts or styles to head.html is also not advisable for performance and code management reasons, see the section Scripts and Styles below for more information about handling scripts and styles.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/helix-project-boilerplate/blob/main/head.html
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/head.html
https://github.com/adobe/business-website/blob/main/head.html
Not Found: 404.html
To create a custom 404 response, place a 404.html file into the root of your github repository. This will be served on any URL that doesn’t map to an existing resource in either content or code, and replaces the body of the out of the box minimalist 404 response.
The 404 can mimic the markup of an existing page including your code for the site, with navigation footers etc., or it can have a completely different appearance.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/hlxsites/bamboohr-website/blob/main/404.html See in Action
https://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/404.html See in Action
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/404.html See in Action
Don’t Serve: .hlxignore
There are some files in your repo that should not be served from your website, either because you would like to keep them private or they are not relevant to the delivery of the website (e.g. tests, build tools, build artifacts, etc.) and don’t need to be observed by the AEM bot. You can add those to a .hlxignore file in the same format as the well-known .gitignore file.
Please see the following example.
https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/.hlxignore
Tame the Bots: robots.txt
A robots.txt file is generally a regular file that is served as you would expect on your production website on your own domain. To protect your preview and origin site from being indexed, your .page and .live sites will serve a robots.txt file that disallows all robots instead of the robots.txt file from your repo.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/robots.txt
https://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/robots.txt
https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/robots.txt
Query and Indexing: helix-query.yaml
There is a flexible indexing facility that lets you keep track of all of your content pages conveniently as a spreadsheet. This facility is often used to show lists or feeds of pages as well as to filter and sort content on a website. Please see the document Indexing for more information.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
Automate Your Sitemap: helix-sitemap.yaml
Complex sitemaps can automatically be created for you whenever authors publish new content, including flexible hreflang mappings where needed. This functionality is usually based on the indexing facility.See this GitHub issue for sitemap configuration options.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/fedpub/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
Commonly Used File and Folder Structure
Beyond the files treats as special or configuration files, there is a commonly-used structure that is expressed in the Boilerplate repo.
The common folders below are usually in the root directory of a project repo, but in cases where only a portion of a website is handled by AEM, they are often moved to a subfolder to reflect the mapping of the route of the origin in a CDN.
This means that in a case where for example only /en/blog/ is initially mapped to AEM from the CDN, all the folder structures below (eg. /scripts, /styles, /blocks etc.) are moved into a the /en/blog/ folder in GitHub to keep the CDN mapping as simple as possible.
With a simple adjustment of the reference to scripts.js and styles.css in head.html (see above) it is possible to indicate that all the necessary files are loaded from the respective code base directory. To avoid url rewriting the folder structure is also created the content source (eg. sharepoint or google drive) by having a directory structure of /en/blog/.In many cases as the AEM footprint grows on a site there is a point in time when the code gets moved back to the root folder and the head.html references are adjusted accordingly.
Scripts and Styles
By convention in a AEM project, the head.html references styles.css, scripts.js, and aem.js located in /scripts and /styles, as the entry points for the project code.
scripts.js is where your global custom javascript code lives and is where the block loading code is triggered. styles.css hosts the global styling information for your site, and minimally contains the global layout information that is needed to display the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).As all three files are loaded before the page can be displayed, it is important that they are kept relatively small and executed efficiently.Beyond styles.css, a lazy-styles.css file is commonly used, which is loaded after the LCP event, and therefore can contain slower/more CSS information. This could be a good place for fonts or global CSS that is below the fold.
In addition to scripts.js, there is the commonly-used delayed.js. This is a catch-all for libraries that need to be loaded on a page but should be kept from interfering with the delivery of the page. This is a good place for code that is outside of the control of your project and usually includes the martech stack and other libraries.
Please see the document Keeping it 100, Web Performance for more information about optimizing your site performance.
Blocks
Most of the project-specific CSS and JavaScript code lives in blocks. Authors create blocks in their documents. Developers then write the corresponding code that styles the blocks with CSS and/or decorates the DOM to take the markup of a block and transform it to the structure that’s needed or convenient for desired styling and functionality.
The block name is used as both the folder name of a block as well as the filename for the .css and .js files that are loaded by the block loader when a block is used on a page.
The block name is also used as the CSS class name on the block to allow for intuitive styling. The javascript is loaded as a module (ESM) and exports a default function that is executed as part of the block loading.
A simple example is the Columns Block. It adds additional classes in JavaScript based on how many columns are in the respective instance created by the author. This allows it to be able to use flexible styling of content that is in two columns vs. three columns.
Icons
Most projects have SVG files that are usually added to the /icons folder, and can be referenced with a :<iconname>: notation by authors. By default, icons are inlined into the DOM so they can be styled with CSS, without having to create SVG symbols.

This is a good place for code that is outside of the control of your project and usually includes the martech stack and other libraries.
Please see the document Keeping it 100, Web Performance for more information about optimizing your site performance.
Blocks
Most of the project-specific CSS and JavaScript code lives in blocks. Authors create blocks in their documents. Developers then write the corresponding code that styles the blocks with CSS and/or decorates the DOM to take the markup of a block and transform it to the structure that’s needed or convenient for desired styling and functionality.
The block name is used as both the folder name of a block as well as the filename for the .css and .js files that are loaded by the block loader when a block is used on a page.
The block name is also used as the CSS class name on the block to allow for intuitive styling. The javascript is loaded as a module (ESM) and exports a default function that is executed as part of the block loading.
A simple example is the Columns Block. It adds additional classes in JavaScript based on how many columns are in the respective instance created by the author. This allows it to be able to use flexible styling of content that is in two columns vs. three columns.
Icons
Most projects have SVG files that are usually added to the /icons folder, and can be referenced with a :<iconname>: notation by authors. By default, icons are inlined into the DOM so they can be styled with CSS, without having to create SVG symbols.

Block Collection
This is a collection of blocks considered a part of the AEM product and are recommended as blueprints for blocks in your project.
These blocks come from real production AEM projects. To be a part of this collection, a block needs to have a high use across a number of projects and provide enough abstract functionality and be general enough so it can be reused without having to change the underlying content model.
As the needs and designs of websites change, the block collection will change as well. Additions will be made to reflect emerging needs of projects, but blocks that are not used frequently enough will also be removed (deprecated).
There are few technical principles for the blocks in the collection:
Intuitive: Content structure that’s intuitive and easy to author
Useable: No dependencies, compatible with boilerplate
Responsive: Works across all breakpoints
Context Aware: Inherits CSS context such text and background colors
Localizable: No hard-coded content
Fast: No negative performance impact
SEO and A11y: SEO friendly and accessible
All of the blocks can be considered as a basis for your own block development. It is very likely that you will change all the .css and .js code to meet your own project needs. The primary value of these blocks is the content structure they provide.Considering that the code of your block will be fully adapted to your project, there is no intent for the blocks in the collection to be backwards compatible to their respective older versions or to make them upgradable.
Boilerplate
The most commonly used blocks (as well as default content types) are curated in the AEM Boilerplate and are a part of every AEM project. For a block to become a part of boilerplate it has to be used by the vast majority of all AEM projects.
The code base for all the blocks in AEM Boilerplate is open-source and can be found on GitHub adobe/aem-boilerplate
Blocks in AEM Boilerplate can be discovered using the sidekick library below, use the copy button to copy the corresponding content structure into your clipboard and paste into a document to see the content structure.

Block Collection
The block collection contains blocks that are commonly-used, but are not so common to be considered boilerplate. As a rule-of-thumb, to be included in the block collection a block must be used on more than half of all AEM projects.
The block collection can be the entry path into boilerplate code. Likewise if a block in the boilerplate is no longer used as much, it can be moved to this collection.
The code base for all the blocks in AEM Block Collection is open-source and can be found on GitHub adobe/aem-block-collection

Consent Banner
If you have immediate need of a block that is not yet part of the collection, it is relatively easy to find AEM projects on GitHub that have example implementations for all of the above candidates.
Block Party
The Block Party is a place for the AEM developer community to showcase what they have built on AEM sites. It also allows others to avoid reinventing the wheel and reuse these blocks / code snippets / integrations built by the community and tweak the code as necessary to fit their own projects. See Block Party for everything it has to offer.
Note: While we love and support our AEM developer community, Adobe is not responsible for maintaining or updating the code that is showcased in Block Party. Please use the code at your own discretion.

https://www.aem.live/developer/spreadsheets

Spreadsheets and JSON
In addition to translating Google Docs and Word documents into markdown and HTML markup, AEM also translates spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel workbooks and Google Sheets) into JSON files that can easily be consumed by your website or web application.
This enables many uses for content that is table-oriented or structured.
Sheets and Sheet structure
The simplest example of a sheet consists of a table that uses the first row as column names and the subsequent rows as data. An example might look something like this.
After a preview and publish via the sidekick, AEM translates this table to a JSON representation which is served to requests to the corresponding .json resource. The above example gets translated to:
AEM allows you to manage workbooks with multiple sheets.
If there is only one sheet, AEM will by default use that sheet as the source of the information.
If there are multiple sheets, AEM will deliver sheets that have names prefixed with shared-. This lets you keep sheets in the same workbook that will not be exposed.
If there is a sheet named shared-default, AEM will deliver it as a single sheet, unless there is a query parameter pointing to a different sheet.
If there are multiple sheets with shared- prefix, AEM will deliver them in multi-sheet format. See below for an example.
Note: the helix- prefix is deprecated and the more neutral shared- prefix should be used.
See the query parameter section for details on how to query a specific sheet.
Multi-Sheet Format
If there are multiple sheets with shared- prefix, AEM will deliver them in multi-sheet format. Here's an example of a payload with 2 sheets:
The :names property contains an array with all the names of the contained sheets.
For each sheet name in :names there is a property in the payload. The value is the corresponding sheet data in single sheet format.
Query Parameters
Offset and Limit
Spreadsheets and JSON files can get very large. In such cases, AEM supports the use of limit and offset query parameters to indicate which rows of the spreadsheet are delivered. In case of a multi-sheet, offset and limit are applied to all sheets in the payload.
As AEM always compresses the JSON, payloads are generally relatively small. Therefore by default AEM limits the number of rows it returns to 1000 if the limit query parameter is not specified. This is sufficient for many simple cases.
Sheet
The sheet query parameter allows an application to specify one or multiple specific sheets in the spreadsheet or workbook. As an example ?sheet=jobs will return the sheet named shared-jobs and ?sheet=jobs&sheet=articles will return the data for the sheets named shared-jobs and shared-articles.
Special Sheet Names
In certain use cases, AEM also writes to spreadsheets, where it expects specific sheet names:
The indexing service only writes to a sheet named raw_index, which may be delivered via JSON in a single sheet setup.
Arrays
Native arrays are not supported as cell values, so they are delivered as strings.
"tags": "[\"Adobe Life\",\"Responsibility\",\"Diversity & Inclusion\"]"
You can turn them back into arrays in JavaScript using JSON.parse().

https://www.aem.live/developer/indexing

Indexing
Adobe Experience Manager offers a way to keep an index of all the published pages in a particular section of your website. This is commonly used to build lists, feeds, and enable search and filtering use cases for your pages or content fragments.
AEM keeps this index in a spreadsheet and offers access to it using JSON. Please see the document Spreadsheets and JSON for more information.
We will introduce the concept of creating a query index by previewing an Excel workbook or Google spreadsheet first. Note, that if you already have a custom query definition in a file called helix-query.yaml in your GitHub repository, it is no longer possible to create indexes that way. Every new index will have to be manually added to that helix-query.yaml.
Setting Up an Initial Query Index
In this section we’ll create a query index in the root folder that will index all documents in your backend.
After setting up your fstab.yaml with a mountpoint that points into your SharePoint site or Google Drive, go to the root folder.
Depending on your backend, create either a workbook named query-index.xlsx for SharePoint or a spreadsheet named query-index for Google Drive.
In that spreadsheet or workbook, create a sheet named raw_index.
Setting Up Properties to be Added to the Index
In your query-index document, add a header line and in the first column add path as the header name.
In the following columns of the header line, add all other properties you need extracted from the rendered HTML page.
In the following example in Google Drive, the extracted fields are title, image, description, and lastModified.
Pages are indexed when they are published. To remove pages from index, they have to be unpublished.
For simple scenarios without custom index definition, pages that have robots metadata property set to noindex will automatically be omitted from indexing by AEM. (There are a few special scenarios here, for more details see the section Special Scenarios for Robots).
The following table summarizes the properties that are available and from where in the HTML page they’re extracted.
Returns the content of the meta tag named article:tag in the head element as an array.
See the document Spreadsheets and JSON for more information on array-handling.
For every other header added, the indexer will try to find a meta tag with a corresponding name.
Activate Your Index
To activate your index, preview the spreadsheet using the sidekick. This will create an index configuration.
Checking Your Index
The Admin Service has an API endpoint where you can check the index representation of your page. Given your GitHub owner, repository, branch and owner, and a resource path to a page, its endpoint is:
https://admin.hlx.page/index/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/<path>
You should get a JSON response where the data node contains the index representation of the page.
Debugging Your Index Configuration
The AEM CLI has a feature where it will print the index record whenever you change your query configuration, which assists in finding the correct CSS selectors:
$ aem up --print-index
Please see the AEM CLI GitHub documentation for more information and watch this video to learn more about this feature.
Setting Up More Index Configurations
You can define your own custom index configurations by creating your own helix-query.yaml. This allows you to have more than one index configuration in the same helix-query.yaml, where parts of your sites are indexed into different Excel workbooks or Google spreadsheets. See the document Indexing reference for more information.
Special Scenarios for Robots
There are a few nuances on how pages get indexed by AEM in conjunction with indexing setup for your site. Let’s look at them:
In the following 2 situations, setting robots to noindex on the page metadata would not prevent it from being indexed by AEM:
You have added a robots column in query-index.xlsx
You have a helix-query.yaml in your Github repository i.e. you have defined a custom index definition.
Recommendations
If you do not have a custom index definition, it is recommended to not add a robots column to your index sheet unless you have a requirement for doing so.Adding robots column to your index sheet would cause a page to be indexed by AEM even though it may have robots metadata set to noindex.
If you do have a custom index definition, pages would get indexed by AEM irrespective of setting robots to noindex on the page metadata. If you want to prevent this from happening, you can use spreadsheet filters to omit pages from index that have robots metadata set to noindex. For more details, see the section titled "Enforcing noindex configuration with custom index definitions" below.
Enforcing “noindex” configuration with custom index definitions
If you have defined your own custom index definitions in helix-query.yaml, setting the robots property to noindex is not effective in preventing the pages from getting indexed. In order to enforce noindex configuration is such situations, do the following:
Create a sheet named “helix-default” in your query-index.xlsx . After this, your query-index.xlsx spreadsheet should have 2 sheets “raw_index” and “helix-default”. The “raw_index” sheet is there to have all the raw indexed data.
Modify your custom helix-query.yaml (it must be in your project’s Github repository) and add the robots property so that it gets indexed.
Now set up your “helix-default” sheet in the query-index.xlsx spreadsheet to get automatically filled up using Excel formula which ensures that all the rows in raw_index which have robots property set as noindex, do not get copied over to the helix-default sheet. This can be done by using an Excel formula like this =FILTER(Table1,NOT(Table1[robots]="noindex"))
Now your helix-default sheet has only the rows from raw_index that do not have robots property set to noindex.
Ensure that you publish the pages that you want to get indexed.
Now if you fetch the index as usual like: https://<branch>--<repo>-<org>.hlx.page/query-index.json, you’d only get data from helix-default sheet i.e. entries that are not explicitly prevented from getting indexed through the robot property set as noindex.

Web Performance, Keeping your Lighthouse Score 100.
The quality of the experience of websites is crucial to achieving the business goals of your website and the satisfaction of your visitors.
Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is optimized to deliver excellent experiences and optimal web performance. With the Real Use Monitoring (RUM) operations data collection, information is continuously collected from field use and offers a way to iterate on real use performance measurements without having to wait for the CRuX data to show effects of code and deployment changes. It is common for field data collected in RUM to deviate from the lab results, as the network, geo-location and processing power for real devices are much more diverse than the simulated conditions in a lab.
The Google PageSpeed Insight Service is proven to be a great lab measurement tool. It can be used to avoid the slow deterioration of the performance and experience score of your website.
If you start your project with the Boilerplate as in the Developer Tutorial, you will get a very stable Lighthouse score on PageSpeed Insight for both Mobile and Desktop at 100. On every component of the lighthouse score there is some buffer for the project code to consume and still be within the boundaries of a perfect 100 lighthouse score.
Testing Your Pull Requests
It turns out that it is hard to improve your Lighthouse score once it is low, but it is not hard to keep it at 100 if you continuously test.
When you open a pull request (PR) on a project, the test URLs in the description of your project are used to run the PageSpeed Insights Service against. The AEM GitHub bot will automatically fail your PR if the score is below 100 with a little bit of buffer to account for some volatility of the results.
The results are for the mobile lighthouse score, as they tend to be harder to achieve than desktop.
Why Google PageSpeed Insights?
Many teams and individuals use their own configurations for measuring Lighthouse scores. Different teams have developed their own test harnesses and use their own test tools with configurations that have been set up as part of their continuous monitoring and performance reporting practices.
The performance of a website impacts its rankings in search results, which is reflected by the Core Web Vitals in the crUX report. Google has a great handle on the relevant average combinations of device information (e.g. screen size) as well as network performance of those devices. But in the end, SEO is the ultimate arbiter of what good vs. bad web performance is. As the specific configuration is a moving target, performance practices should be aligned with the current average devices and network characteristics globally.
So instead of using a project specific configuration for Lighthouse testing, we use the continuously-updated configurations seen as part of the mobile and desktop strategies referenced in the latest versions of the Google PageSpeed Insights API.
While there may be additional insight that some developers feel they can collect from other ways of measuring Lighthouse scores, to be able to have a meaningful and comparable performance conversation across projects, there needs to be a way to measure performance universally. The default PageSpeed Insight Service is the most authoritative, most widely accepted lab test when it comes to measuring your performance.However it is important to remember that the recommendations that you get from PageSpeed Insights do not necessarily lead to better results, especially the closer you get to a lighthouse score of 100.Core Web Vitals (CWV) collected by the built-in RUM data collection play an important role in validating results. For minor changes, however, the variance of the results and the lack of sufficient data points (traffic) over a short period of time makes it impractical to get statistically relevant results in most cases.
Three-Phase Loading (E-L-D)
Dissecting the payload that's on a web page into three phases makes it relatively straight-forward to achieve a clean lighthouse score and therefore set a baseline for a great customer experience.
The three phase loading approach divides the payload and execution of the page into three phases
Phase E (Eager): This contains everything that's needed to get to the largest contentful paint (LCP).
Phase L (Lazy): This contains everything that is controlled by the project and largely served from the same origin.
Phase D (Delayed): This contains everything else such as third-party tags or assets that are not material to experience.
Phase E: Eager
Before anything happens, it is important to note that the body must be hidden (with display:none) to make sure no images start downloading and to avoid initial CLS.
In the eager phase, the first action is to “decorate” the DOM: the loading sequence makes few adjustments, mainly adds CSS classes to icons, buttons, blocks and sections and creates the auto-blocks. See the Markup, Sections, Blocks, and Auto Blocking page for more details on the resulting markup.
The body can then already be displayed, considering that sections are not loaded yet and remain hidden.
Then, the full first section is loaded with a priority given to the first image of this section, the “LCP candidate”. In theory, the fewer blocks the first section has, the faster LCP can be loaded.
Once the LCP candidate and all blocks of the section are loaded, the first section can be displayed and the fonts can start loading asynchronously.
This ends the eager phase.
LCP
In general, the LCP is the “hero“ image displayed at the top of a page. It is crucial to make sure this image is loaded and displayed as soon as possible in the loading sequence (see the Eager phase).
Everything that's needed to be loaded for the true LCP to be displayed must be loaded. In a project, this usually consists of the markup, the CSS styles and JavaScript files.
In many cases the LCP element is contained in a block, where the block .js and and .css also have to be loaded.
It is a good rule of thumb to keep the aggregate payload before the LCP is displayed below 100kb, which usually results in an LCP event quicker than 1560ms (LCP scoring at 100 in PSI). Especially on mobile the network tends to be bandwidth constrained, so changing the loading sequence before LCP has minimal to no impact.
Loading from or connecting to a second origin before the LCP occurred is strongly discouraged as establishing a second connection (TLS, DNS, etc.) adds a significant delay to the LCP.
There are situations where the actual LCP element is not included in the markup that is transmitted to the client. This happens when there is an indirection or lookup (for example a service that’s called, a fragment that’s loaded or a lookup that needs to happen in a .json) for the LCP element.In those situations, it is important that the page loading waits with guessing the LCP candidate (currently the first image on the page) until the first block has made the necessary changes to the DOM.
There are other situations where the content contains 2 hero images, one for desktop, one for mobile. Same as above, it is important to make sure that the correct image is considered as the LCP candidate and the “hero” block might need to be adjusted to remove the unnecessary image from the DOM (remove the desktop image on mobile devices or vice versa) to not load a bandwidth consuming image or even worse, load the unnecessary image first as the LCP candidate.
Finally, the LCP can be something other than an image, a video, a long text… For all those cases, a deep understanding of the loading sequence and how the LCP candidate is computed is necessary to make the correct optimizations.
Phase L: Lazy
In the lazy phase, the portion of the payload is loaded that doesn't affect total blocking time (TBT) and ultimately first input delay (FID).
This includes things like loading the next sections and their blocks (JavaScript and CSS) as well as loading all the remaining images according to their loading="lazy" attribute and other JavaScript libraries that are not blocking. The lazy phase is generally everything that happens in the various blocks you are going to create to cover the project needs.
In this phase it would still be advisable that the bulk of the payload come from the same origin and is controlled by the first party, so that changes can be made if needed to avoid negative impact on TBT, TTI and FID.
Phase D: Delayed
In the delayed phase, the parts of the payload are loaded that don't have an immediate impact to the experience and/or are not controlled by the project and come from third parties. Think of marketing tooling, consent management, extended analytics, chat/interaction modules etc. which are often deployed through tag management solutions.
It is important to understand that for the impact on the overall customer experience to be minimized, the start of this phase needs to be significantly delayed. The delayed phase should be at least three seconds after the LCP event to leave enough time for the rest of the experience to get settled.
The delayed phase is usually handled in delayed.js which serves as an initial catch-all for scripts that cause TBT. Ideally, the TBT problems are removed from the scripts in question either by loading them outside of the main thread (in a web worker) or by just removing the actual blocking time from the code. Once the problems are fixed, those libraries can easily be added to the lazy phase and be loaded earlier.
Ideally there is no blocking time in your scripts, which is sometimes hard to achieve as commonly used technology like tag managers or build tooling create large JavaScript files that are blocking as the browser is parsing them. From a performance perspective it is advisable to remove those techniques, make sure your individual scripts are not blocking and load them individually as separate smaller files.
Header and Footer
The header and specifically the footer of the page are not in the critical path to the LCP, which is why they are loaded asynchronously in their respective blocks. Generally, resources that do not share the same life cycle (meaning that they are updated with authoring changes at different times) should be kept in separate documents to make the caching chain between the origins and the browser simpler and more effective. Keeping those resources separate increases cache hit ratios and reduces cache invalidation and cache management complexity.
Fonts
Since web fonts are often a strain on bandwidth and loaded from a different origin via a font service like https://fonts.adobe.com or https://fonts.google.com, it is largely impossible to load fonts before the LCP, this is why they are loaded right after.
By default, the AEM Boilerplate implements the font fallback technique to avoid CLS when the font is loaded. It would be counterproductive to preload the fonts (via Early hints, h2-push or markup) and largely impact the performances.
Bonus: Speed is Green
Building websites that are fast, small, and quick to render is not just a good idea to deliver exceptional experiences that convert better, it is also a good way to reduce carbon emissions.
Common Sources of Performance Issues
Over time, we gathered a collection of anti-patterns that negatively impact performance, and need to be avoided to be compliant with the best practices in this document.
Early hints / h2-push / pre-connect are part of the network budget
Instinctively, it would make sense to tell the browser to download as much as possible and as early as possible, even before the markup processing even starts. But remember, the ultimate goal is to have a stable page to show to the visitor as quickly as possible. LCP timing is a good proxy for that.
As a rule of thumb, to get an LCP to 100 on Mobile with PageSpeed Insight the network constraints are set up in a way that there can only be a single host with a network payload that's not exceeding 100kb, as the setup is largely bandwidth constrained. Early hints, h2-push and pre-connect consume that bandwidth, by downloading resources that are not required for LCP and therefore negatively impact the performance, and have to be removed.
Redirects for paths resolution
If a visitor requests www.domain.com and gets redirected to www.domain.com/en and then to www.domain.com/en/home, they get a penalty for each redirect, i.e. performance is negatively impacted. This is mostly visible in Core Web Vitals measured via RUM or CrUX as lab results in PageSpeed Insights by default exclude redirect overhead from the lab test.
CDN client scripts injection
Our markup but also our .aem.page and .aem.live origins are optimized for performance and we are extremely careful with any part of the payload, as well as the loading sequence for resources.
Some CDN vendors and configurations inject scripts that are consuming bandwidth and create blocking time, before LCP with negative impacts performance. Those scripts should be disabled, or loaded appropriately in the loading sequence after LCP.
A comparison of a .aem.live origin of the PageSpeed Insight report, with the corresponding site that's fronted by a customers CDN (e.g. production site) will show the negative impact produced by a CDN outside of AEM's control.
CDN TTFB and Protocol Implementation Impact
Depending on the CDN vendor, there are differences in protocol implementations and performance characteristics for the pure delivery of the HTTP payload. Additional tooling like WAF and other network infrastructure upstream of AEM may also negatively impact performance.A comparison of a .aem.live origin of the PageSpeed Insight report, with the corresponding site that's fronted by a customers CDN (e.g. production site) will show the negative impact produced by a CDN outside of AEM's control.

Markup, Sections, Blocks, and Auto Blocking
To design websites and create functionality, developers use the markup and DOM that is rendered dynamically from the content. The markup and DOM are constructed in a way that allows flexible manipulation and styling. At the same time it provides out-of-the-box functionality so the developer does not have to worry about some of the aspects of modern websites.
Structure of a Document
The single most important aspect when structuring a document is to make it simple and intuitive for authors who will contribute the content.
This means that it is strongly recommended to involve authors very early in the process. In many cases it is good practice to just let authors put the content that needs to go on to a page into a Google Doc or Word document without having any notion of blocks and section, and then try to make small structural changes and introduce sections and blocks only where necessary.
A document follows the following structure in the abstract.
A page as authored in Word or a Google Doc document uses the well-understood semantic model like headings, body text, lists, images, links, etc. that is shared between HTML, markdown, and Google Doc / Word. We call this default content. In an ideal situation one would leave as much of the content authored as default content as possible, since this is the natural way for authors to treat documents.In addition to default content, we have a concept of page sections, separated by horizontal rules or --- to group certain elements of a page together. There may be both semantic and design reasons to group content together. A simple case could be that a section of a page has a different background color.In addition to that there is concept of blocks which are authored as a table with a heading as the first row that identifies the type of block. This concept is the easiest approach to componentize your code.
Sections can contain multiple blocks. Blocks should never be nested as it makes things very hard to use for authors.
DOM vs. Markup
AEM produces a clean and easily readable semantic markup from the content that’s provided to it. You can easily access it using the view source feature and have a look at the markup of the page you are currently reading.
The JavaScript library used in scripts.js takes the markup and enhances it into a DOM that is then used for most development tasks, specifically to build blocks. To create a DOM that’s easy to work with for custom project code, it is best to view it as a two-step process.
In the first step, we create the markup with sections, blocks, and default content that will look similar to this.
In the second step, the above mark-up is augmented into the following example DOM, which then can be used for styling and adding functionality. The differences between the markup that’s delivered from the server and the augmented DOM that is used for most of the development tasks is highlighted below.
It primarily consists of introducing a wrapper <div> for blocks and default content and dynamically adding additional helpful CSS classes and data attributes that are used by the AEM block loader.
Sections
Sections are a way to group default content and blocks by the author. Most of the time section breaks are introduced based on visual differences between sections such as a different background color for a part of a page.
From a development perspective, there is usually not much interaction with sections beyond CSS styling.Sections can contain a special block called Section Metadata, which results in data attributes to a section. The names of the data attributes can be chosen by the authors, and the only well-known section metadata property is Style which will be turned into additional CSS classes added to the containing section element.
Blocks and default content are always wrapped in a section, even if the author doesn’t specifically introduce section breaks.
Default Content
There is a broad range of semantics that are shared between Word documents, Google Docs, markdown, and HTML. For example there are headings of different levels (eg. <h1> - <h6>), images, links, lists (<ul>, <ol>), emphasis (<em>, <strong>) etc.
We take advantage of the intuitive understanding that authors have of how to use these semantics in the tools that they are familiar with (eg. Word/Google docs) and maps those to markdown and then renders them in the HTML markup.
All mappings should be relatively straightforward and intuitive for the developer. One area where we go a little bit further than the simplest possible translation is in handling images. Instead of a simple <img> tag, a full <picture> tag is rendered with a number of different resolutions needed for display on desktop and mobile devices as well as different formats for modern browsers that support webp and older browsers which do not.
Blocks
Most of the project-specific CSS and JavaScript lives in blocks. Authors create blocks in their documents and developers write the corresponding code that styles the blocks with CSS and/or decorates the DOM to take the markup of a block and transform it to the structure that’s needed or convenient for desired styling and functionality.
The block name is used as both the folder name of a block as well as the filename for the CSS and JavaScript files that are loaded by the block loader when a block is used on a page. The block name is also used as the CSS class name on the block to allow for intuitive styling.
The JavaScript is loaded as a Module (ESM) and exports a default function that is executed as part of the block loading.
All block level CSS should be scoped to the block to make sure that there are no side-effects for other parts of your project, which means that all selectors in a block should be prefixed with the corresponding block class. In certain cases it makes sense to use the block’s wrapper or containing section for the selector as well.
There is a balance of DOM manipulation in JavaScript and complexity of the CSS selectors. Complex brittle CSS selectors are not recommended and at the same time adding classes to every element makes your code more complex and disregards the semantics of elements.
One of the most important tenets of a project is to keep things simple and intuitive for authors. Complicated blocks make it hard to author content, so it is important that developers absorb the complexity of translating an intuitive authoring experience into the DOM that is needed for layout or application logic. It is often tempting to delegate complexity to the author. Instead, developers should make sure that blocks do not become unwieldy to create for authors. An author should always be able to simply copy/paste a block and intuitively understand what it is about.
A simple example is the Columns Block. It adds additional classes in JavaScript based on how many columns are in the respective instance created by the author. This allows it to be able to use flexible styling of content that is in two columns vs. three columns.
Blocks can be very simple or contain full application components or widgets and provide a way for the developer to componentize their codebase into small chunks of code that can be managed easily and can be loaded on to the web pages as needed.
A block’s content is rendered into the markup as nested <div> tags for the rows and columns that the author entered. In the simplest case, a block has only a single cell.
Authors can add blocks to their pages in an ad-hoc manner by simply adding a table with the block name in the first row or table heading. Some blocks are also loaded automatically. header and footer blocks that need to be present on every page of a site are a good example of that.
Block Options
If you need a block to look or behave slightly differently based on certain circumstances, but not different enough to become a new block in itself, you can let authors add block options to blocks in parentheses. These options add modified classes to the block. For example Columns (wide) in a table header will generate the following markup.
<div class=”columns wide”>
Block options can also contain multiple words. For example Columns (super wide) will be concatenated using hyphens.
<div class=”columns super-wide”>
If block options are comma-separated, such as Columns (dark, wide), they will be added as separate classes.
<div class=”columns dark wide”>
Auto Blocking
In an ideal scenario the majority of content is authored outside of blocks, as introducing tables into a document makes it harder to read and edit. Conversely blocks provide a great mechanism for developers to keep their code organized.
A frequently-used mechanism to get the best of both worlds is called auto blocking. Auto blocking turns default content and metadata into blocks without the author having to physically create them. Auto blocking happens very early in the page decoration process before blocks are loaded and is a practice that programmatically creates the DOM structure of a block as it would come as markup from the server.
Auto blocking is often used in combination with metadata, particularly the template property. If pages have a common template, meaning that they share a certain page design or functionality, that’s usually a good opportunity for auto blocking.
A good example is an article header of a blog post. It might contain information about the author, the title of the blog post, a hero image, as well as the publication date. Instead of having the author put together a block that contains all that information, an auto block (e.g. article-header block) would be programmatically added to the page based on the <h1>, the first image, the blog author, and publication date metadata.
This allows the content author to keep the information in its natural place, the document structure outside of a block. At the same time, the developer can keep all the layout and styling information in a block.
Another very common use case is to wrap blocks around links in a document. A good example is an author linking to a YouTube video by simply including a link, while the developer would like to keep all the code for the video inline embed in an embed block.
This mechanism can also be used as a flexible way to include both external applications and internal references to video, content fragments, modals, forms, and other application elements.
The code for your projects auto blocking lives in buildAutoBlocks() in your scripts.js.
Please see the following examples of auto blocking.

Favicon
Adding a favicon to your site gives it a professional look in your visitor’s browsers:
Adding a favicon
Add a file called favicon.ico to the root folder in your GitHub repository. We recommend using the .ico format for best support across all major browsers. That’s all – your site now has a favicon!

Custom HTTP Response Headers
In some cases, it is useful to apply custom HTTP response headers to resources, for example to allow CORS. If you want to specify headers, create either an Excel Workbook or a Google Sheets Workbook in the /.helix folder of your website in Sharepoint or Google Drive called headers.xlsx in SharePoint or headers in Google Drive.
If your site uses the configuration service, see here for instructions how to apply custom headers.
The workbook should have only one sheet and can define response headers using the url/key/value format as shown below.
The URL column is a glob pattern matching the pages that should have the header should be applied to. A wildcard * can be used as a prefix or suffix, allowing for flexible matches on the URL pathname. Typical examples include /docs/** or **/docs/**.
After you update the sheet, you need to preview (activate) it. Note that the headers are applied to both the preview and live versions of the content. Caches will be purged automatically, so your changes will take effect immediately. See the Admin API documentation for more information.
Note: If the changes apply to code resources, the changes won’t take effect until the code is synced again, either by updating the code in its repository or by manually updating via the Admin API.

Development Collaboration and Good Practices
Working with a large number of development teams across many projects and organizations, we found that it is useful to collect some of our insights. Some of those are related to AEM, but the majority are related to general purpose frontend development or are just general guidelines on how to collaborate in a team of developers.
You may read some of those items and think that it is generally understood as common sense amongst developers. We agree, and that’s a great sign that you are ready to work in a collaborative way on AEM projects together with other developers.
At this point this is just a collection of lessons learned from our engagements on a growing set of projects.
GitHub
Keep the repository public
Given that all project code is sent to the client-side and therefore accessible in everyone's browser, we recommend keeping the repository as public. Adobe has a longstanding history in the open-source community and generally advocates for code to be public unless there is a compelling reason to make it private.
Maintaining a public repository offers several benefits of open source projects like community code reviews, and developers are able to share knowledge and code, in turn fostering innovation and collaboration. Public repositories also make it quick and easy for Adobe and other developers to create free pull requests to help improve your project and automatic PSI checks (on the feature branches) are provided by Adobe, which are not enabled by default for private repositories.
If you still have a strong need to keep your repository private, be aware that certain features are only available in paid plans for private repositories, such as branch protection rules and limited CI/CD minutes. For more details, please see GitHub’s pricing page.
Create pull requests
If you work on a project with multiple developers it is rarely a good idea to push directly to main. When your project is in production code changes that are merged or pushed to main often means that they are released to production. Protecting your main branch is a good mechanism to ensure that people don’t push to main by accident, which is especially advisable with a site that is in production.
Pull request etiquette
If you open a pull request, make sure that you include a URL to a page (or a number of links to pages) on your branch, where the reviewer can see your code in action. If you are updating code of an existing block, make sure to include the link that features the block you are updating as the reviewer may not know where this block is in use to test its functionality.
Keep the scope of your Pull Request to what’s in the title/description of the PR.
For work still in progress, opening a Draft Pull Request helps prevent wasting people's time with reviewing code still in flux as well as accidental merging.
Linting
The standard boilerplate setup runs the linting tools eslint (airbnb-base) and stylelint for each change in a Pull Request. Do not submit a Pull Request with linting errors for review.
Changing the linting configuration is not recommended unless you have a really good reason. Personal preference is not a good reason. Changing linting rules makes it difficult to reuse code from the AEM boilerplate, block collection or other open source AEM projects. Arguing if something is a good reason to change the linting rules is usually a lot more effort than just categorically saying no.
PageSpeed Insights
The AEM Code Sync GitHub app runs Google PageSpeed Insights for each change in a pull request to assess the impact on Web Performance, Accessibility, SEO and Best Practices. Do not submit a pull request for review that doesn’t have a green Lighthouse Score for mobile and desktop, ideally 100 for both.
Reviews
It is good practice to have your code reviewed by the maintainer or main developer of the project you are working on. This can be encouraged by setting up branch protection on main to require pull requests with at least 1 approval before any code can be merged. You can still allow project administrators to bypass branch protection settings for emergencies.
Shared branches
It is good practice to consider branches for individual Pull Requests as private to the developer who created the branch. Do not just push into other developers’ branches without having been invited to do so. There are situations where people are collaborating on Pull Requests but it should be an explicit agreement.
Merging pull requests (deploying to production)
Merge your own pull requests only. If the person who opened the Pull Request has the ability to merge their own Pull Request, the author of the code is the ideal person to merge. There are situations where the author specifically states that this can and should be merged by someone else, and in those cases a maintainer (main developer) of the project should feel free to merge a Pull Request.
Even if a Pull Request is approved, you should always check with the author of the Pull Request if they are ready to merge.
The AEM Code Sync GitHub app will automatically deploy changes merged into the main branch to production.
(Scaled) Trunk-based development
For AEM projects with their built-in devops and CI/CD, we recommend following the scaled trunk-based development model. This means you merge small pull requests into production often, but the quality assurance & review efforts are limited to small change sets. Nobody wants to review and test large pull requests, and long-lived branches with lots of changes tend to be difficult (and dangerous) to merge.
Dependency management
Make sure your dependencies are kept up to date. Even if you don't add more dependencies, it is good practice to keep the minimal out of the box dependencies (linting) up to date. Feel free to use tools like Renovate.
CSS
CSS selector block isolation
AEM blocks most often operate as components collaboratively in the same DOM / CSSOM. This means that you should write your CSS selectors in a block .css in a way that isolates your CSS from impacting layout of elements outside your block. The easiest way to do this is by making sure that every CSS selector in the .css of a block only applies to the block.
Cascade in CSS
Use your CSS classnames wisely. Some CSS classes and variables are used across different blocks, and others are not expected to be used outside your block. Prefixing classes and variables that are private to your block with the block name is good practice. Conversely, if there are CSS classes and CSS context that should be inherited (often those can be authored) those classes and variables should not be prefixed.
CSS indentation and property order
Outside of a CSS refactoring PR, don’t change sequencing on properties or the indentation across the CSS files you touch in a functional PR. Every developer has different preferences on sort order of properties or indentation. Make sure the diff that you see in your PR is isolated to the changes you actually want reviewed before submitting it.
CSS selectors complexity
Don’t let your CSS Selectors become complex and unreadable. Often it is better to decorate additional CSS classes/Elements onto your DOM and write readable CSS instead. Complex CSS selectors also often are harder to maintain and more brittle than the equivalents in JS.
CSS naming
Naming your classes simple and intuitive is helpful for other developers. Avoid namespacing unless it is necessary within the scope of a project. There is often no need to specify the type or the origin (e.g. the name of your design system) of a CSS variable that is to be used across the entire project.
Leverage ARIA attributes for styling
In many situations you will add ARIA Attributes for accessibility. Since those have well defined semantics like expanded or hidden that are understood by all developers, in most cases there is really no need to come up with additional classes in your vocabulary that have unknown semantics.
Mobile first
Generally Web projects should be developed “Mobile First”. This means that your CSS without media query should render a mobile site. Add media queries to extend the layout for tablet and desktop.
Breakpoints
Generally use 600px, 900px and 1200px as your breakpoints, all min-width. Don’t mix min-width and max-width. Only use different breakpoints in exceptional cases where you have good understanding why that’s needed.
Less, Sass, PostCSS, Tailwind and friends.
If you are working in the context of a bigger organization, make sure that you don’t introduce a dependency to any CSS preprocessor or framework of your personal preference without getting the buy-in from the entire team and organization. As there are a lot of differing personal preferences in this area, it makes code hard to maintain if every project or every block inside a project uses different technologies.The simplest solution is to rely on the growing CSS feature set which is supported by the browsers.
Modern CSS features
Make sure the features you are using are well supported by evergreen browsers. Depending on the features more or less pervasive support may be acceptable.
JavaScript
Frameworks
On most web sites, frameworks are overkill for simple layout problems outside of application-like functionality. Frameworks often introduce web performance issues (Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals), particularly if they are in the pathway of the LCP or introduce TBT, while trying to address trivial problems. Keep simple things simple.If you are using Javascript Frameworks make sure that you don’t introduce a dependency to any JS Framework or library of your personal preference without getting the buy-in from the entire team and organization. As there are a lot of personal preferences, it makes code hard to maintain if every project or every block inside a project uses different technologies.The simplest solution is to rely on the growing feature set supported by browsers.
Build tool chain
Differing build tool chains from project to project make it hard for new developers to be onboarded and often introduce additional complexity. Make sure that you don’t introduce a dependency of your personal preference without getting the buy-in from the entire team and organization.The simplest solution is to keep the entire project build-less.
Modern JavaScript features
Make sure the features you are using are well supported by evergreen browsers. Depending on the features more or less pervasive support may be acceptable. While AEM can be used with any browser, aem.js has a dependency on browsers that support dynamic import(). Any feature that is supported by the set of browsers that support dynamic import() should be considered safe. Technically, of course, older browsers (e.g., IE) can be supported by AEM projects, but those require heavy customization.
Not all features have the same consequences if a browser doesn’t support them, some may be cosmetic and others may stop the site from working. A common example is “optional chaining”. If a browser doesn’t support “optional chaining”, a single usage can have fatal consequences for the entire page.
Loading 3rd party libraries
Don’t add 3rd party libraries to your <head> via head.html as they will be in the critical path of loading content above the fold and will often be loaded when they are not needed. Add the dependencies where needed via loadScript() to the specific block that has the corresponding requirement.In case of larger 3rd party libraries, you may even want to consider using an IntersectionObserver to make sure you only load them when the block depending on it is actually being scrolled into view.
AEM library (aem.js)
The AEM library (usually called aem.js in a boilerplate project) is currently not minified and obfuscated to make debugging easier. We discourage making changes to it on a project basis and instead recommend project specific extensions to be kept outside of the library. We welcome Pull Requests via GitHub, if you would like to propose changes or bug fixes that are universally applicable.
<head>
The <head> that is delivered from the server as part of the HTML markup should remain minimal and free of marketing technology like Adobe Web SDK, Google Tag Manager or other 3rd party scripts due to performance impacts. Adding inline scripts or styles to <head> is also not advisable for performance and code management reasons.
Minification
Typically this is additional complexity without much benefit unless you have really large JS/CSS files which again would be an anti-pattern. With Edge Delivery, the way the code is structured around blocks, the files should be usually small in size and minifying should not make much of a difference. To be sure, you can compare the Lighthouse Score pre/post minification.Minification makes code slightly harder to debug and you'd need sourcemaps. Also minifying requires an additional build step which can potentially slow down site development work. So you’d want to go there only if there is a tangible benefit of this additional complexity
Content first
Start your development with content
Before writing a line of code, create your (sample) content in a Word or Google Doc (or spreadsheet). Make sure that it feels good for authoring and share it with people on your team that have experience supporting authors. It requires support experience to understand what content structures are easy for authors to understand and recreate. Once you have settled on a content structure that contains all elements you need for your block, and have it reviewed you can get started developing your CSS and JS code.
Use drafts
The content lifecycle is very different from the code life cycle. If you are proposing changes to an existing content structure in your code or come up with a new block, don’t just make those changes on the page you are working on. Copy the page into your /drafts/<yourname>/ folder and make changes there.Once your code changes are merged to main , you can have authors copy or merge your content with the content outside of your /drafts/ folder.
Backwards compatibility of new features
Especially in production environments it is important to keep your anticipated changes to the content structure backwards compatible with existing content. Ideally, code that is being merged should not have an impact on the website or require refactoring the content. Only when new content is put in place through a preview and publish cycle, the new functionality becomes available. This of course doesn’t apply to things like design changes across the existing content or functional bug fixes.
Use content for “static” resources
Generally, it is not a good idea to commit binaries into your GitHub repo. Even text-based static resources, for example HTML files or SVGs should only be put into GitHub in exceptional cases. A good reason to add an SVG to your git repo is if it is referenced from code. Don’t commit anything that is related to the content authoring process, or could be a part of an authoring process. There are some exceptions (usually related to legacy and non-browser clients) that require a certain set of fixed resources that cannot be produced and manipulated dynamically by AEM, but in general if you find a large set of static resources (e.g. images, etc.) or an HTML file in a PR it is most likely not a good practice.
Use content for strings/literals
Strings that are displayed to end users and could possibly be translated or changed at some point should always be authorable and sourced from content (eg. placeholders or other spreadsheets or documents). If you have a literal string that is displayed as text to the visitor of your website via javascript or css code, it is good practice to replace it with a reference to content.

Authoring and Publishing Content
Authoring Content
You already know the most important part.
If you use Microsoft Word or Google Docs, then you already know how to create content.
Your documents in Word or Google Docs become your pages on your website. Your headings in your documents will become headings on your website. Bold, italic, underlining, lists, images, etc. will all appear on your website.
Images and Videos
To add an image to your document, drag the image into the page. Word and Google Docs automatically add it as normal. Your image will be resized to fit the browser window of your visitor. Any resizing you do in Word or Google Docs will have no effect.
It is a good idea to set an alternative text for all images you add to the document, as this increases accessibility and helps search engines find your content.
To do this, use the built-in features of both Word and Google Docs. See the documentation of either product for more details.
Microsoft Word: Add alternative text to a shape, picture, chart, SmartArt graphic, or other object
Google Docs: Make your document or presentation more accessible
Word and Google Docs do not allow you to just drag and drop videos, but you can add videos via SharePoint or Google Drive and add the resulting URL as a link to a suitable block in your document.
Links
Links are an important part of every website and you can add them both in Word and Google Docs. If you are creating a link within your website, enter the URL as is, even if the page you are linking to is not public yet (e.g. a preview or live URL).
Links pointing to other pages on the same site will automatically be adjusted to be relative to your site.
You can link to headings or sections within a page by appending an anchor value to the URL. Heading elements have automatic lower-cased IDs where spaces are replaced with dashes. For example, if a page /about-us has a heading “Our History”, the URL linking to it would be https://<your_host>/about-us#our-history.
Sections
On some websites you have sections or blades that change background color or otherwise indicate breaks in the content. Creating a section break in both Microsoft Word and Google Docs can be done using --- (three hyphens) on a single line. In Google Docs you can also create sections by inserting a Horizontal Line element into the page (select “Insert → Horizontal Line” from the menu).
Metadata & SEO
Metadata is information about your page that is invisible to visitors, but important to search engines and social media sites that want to find your content or embed it.
To add metadata to your page, at the end of the document, create a table like the following. Creating a table works almost the same in Word and Google Docs. See the documentation of either product for more details.
Microsoft Word: from the menu, click “Insert → Table” and select the number of columns and rows you want
Google Docs: from the menu, click “Insert → Table” and choose how many rows and columns you want to add
Structure your table like this:
The first row of the table should just contain the word “Metadata”. This tells the system that there is custom metadata for your document.
Then create one row for each metadata property. The left column contains the name of the metadata property, the right column the value. In most cases, values are plain text, but as you can see from the “image” row, sometimes other content can be used, too.
You’ve just created a metadata block. You can also create metadata for many pages at once. See the document Bulk Metadata for more information.
Special Metadata Properties
In addition to all well-known metadata properties, AEM also supports the following properties with special handling:
canonical
The canonical property will be used as the canonical URL in the following tags:
<link rel=”canonical”>
<meta property="og:url">
<meta name="twitter:url">
If not specified, AEM will generate the canonical URL automatically using the configured production domain.
canonical:extension
The canonical:extension property allows you to define the file extension for canonical URLs. This is useful for ensuring consistent and SEO-friendly canonical URLs across your site, even if the actual file paths do not include the extension.
To avoid having to repeat it for many documents, this property is best used in the bulk metadata sheet by adding a column named canonical:extension. For example, to give an .html extension to all canonical URLs on your site, add an entry like this:
description
The description property will will appear as is, but also be used in the following tags:
<meta property="og:description">
<meta name="twitter:description">
If not specified, AEM will use the first text paragraph with 10 words or more found on the page.
image
The image property will be used for the image URL in the following tags:
<meta property="og:image">
<meta property="og:image:secure_url">
`<meta name="twitter:image">
If not specified, AEM will use the first image found on the page. If the page does not contain any images, the default value will be set to /default-meta-image.png. You can add this file via SharePoint, Google Drive, or GitHub, for example.
title
The title property will be used in the following tags:
<meta property="og:title">
<meta name="twitter:title">
<title></title>
If not specified, AEM will use the first Heading 1 (h1) found on the page.
title:suffix
The title:suffix property enables you to automatically append a specified suffix to the title property of your pages. This is useful to apply branding, to add consistent information, or to meet specific SEO requirements across a set of pages.
To avoid having to repeat it for many documents, this property is best used in the bulk metadata sheet by adding a column named title:suffix. For instance, to append | Adobe to the end of all page titles, add an entry like this:
Note: AEM will always insert a space between the title and the suffix.
tags
The tags property can be used to provide a list of tags, separated by commas or as a bullet list. Each tag will be rendered like this:
<meta property="article:tag">
json-ld
The json-ld property can be used to add a JSON schema rendered like this:
<script type=”application/ld+json”>
Note: consider other methods like client-side JavaScript or head.html to add a JSON schema to your page. In many cases, metadata is not the right approach.
Omitting Metadata Values
If you want to remove a metadata value, you can simply leave its value empty.
Blocks
Blocks are a way to work with more structured content and add special functionality to your site. Which blocks are available to your site depends on what your development team has implemented and differs from site to site. The only block that is common to all sites is the metadata block described previously.
Regardless of site, the structure of a block is always the same: it is a table with a merged first row that serves as the block name (header row). The header row may have specific formatting like a background color to increase their discoverability and differentiation in a document.
Blocks usually contain content, configuration, or references to other pieces of content, be it from other documents, spreadsheets, or both.
As you can see from this example, you are free to put any kind of content into the cells of a block, and it is up to the block to either render the content or ignore it. If the site you are working on uses blocks extensively, then you will probably have a reference list of blocks you can use.
Blocks can have variants in parenthesis. For example, a Columns block can have a (highlight)option which passes a layout hint to the block display logic.
See the document The Block Collection to learn more about out-of-the-box blocks.
Structured Data in Spreadsheets
You can put content into spreadsheets and then the spreadsheet is automatically turned into an API that your developers can use. This allows you to use spreadsheets like a headless CMS for use in data tables, navigation, or feature comparisons, for example.
See the document Spreadsheets and JSON for more information.
Preview and Publish Content
Once a document is created in Google Drive or Sharepoint, you can preview the corresponding web page and eventually publish the content to your production website.
The preview function is used to share pages with stakeholders before they are published and available to the general public on your website.
In order to preview, publish, or delete content, use the Sidekick that can be installed as a browser extension.
Preview
In Word or Google Docs, open the Sidekick, then click the “Preview” button. This will open a new browser window (check for the popup warning) that has the preview version of your site.
Although you can copy and share the URL of this preview, it is not meant for production. It does not have your domain name on it and is invisible to search engines. If the content is ready for publication, you can publish. If you need to make changes, open the Sidekick on the preview page and click “Edit” to go back to Word or Google Docs.
Publish
Publishing makes your content visible to everyone on the internet. To publish something, open the sidekick on a preview page (or follow the instructions above to open the preview again), then click “Publish”. After a few seconds, a new browser window will open, with your page on your public website.
Once your content has been published, it is visible to everyone on the internet, and search engines will be able to find it.
Delete
Generally, deleting published content and therefore removing publicly accessible resources from the web can be problematic because of inbound links from search, social, bookmarks and other referring sites. If a page is deleted that was once published, it is recommended to use redirects to make sure that incoming traffic for the deleted page is sent to the next best place. See the document Redirects for more information.
If you want to remove published content or just delete it from your site as part of a clean-up, doing so is a two-step process.
First, delete the source document from Sharepoint or Google Drive.
Alternatively you can rename the page or move it to a different folder, for example your drafts folder.
Alternatively you can rename the page or move it to a different folder, for example your drafts folder.
Then open the page you want to delete on the preview site and open the sidekick. There will be two options: Delete and Unpublish.
Unpublish removes it from the public production website, but keeps the preview.
Delete removes the preview, too.
Unpublish removes it from the public production website, but keeps the preview.
Delete removes the preview, too.
Deleting or unpublishing something is permanent and cannot be easily undone. If you want to undo a deletion, you have to restore the original document in Sharepoint or Google Drive and then publish it again.

https://www.aem.live/docs/bulk-metadata

Bulk Metadata
By default, metadata is managed at the page level. See Authoring and Publishing Content for more information.
In some cases, it is useful to apply metadata en masse to a website. Common use cases include:
A certain section of a website should look and feel different from the rest of the website (such as a different template or a different theme).
Default metadata such an og:image should be applied to portions of the website.
If a certain portion of the website should not be indexed by robots, the metadata can be used to set the robots meta tag to noindex for a portion of the site.
If you want to create metadata for many pages at once, create a metadata sheet in the root folder of your website content.
Name the file metadata in Google Drive or AEM.
Name the file metadata.xlsx in SharePoint.
The workbook should have only one sheet and at least two columns as in the following image.
The column titled URL has the URL pattern of the pages that should get a particular metadata entry.
The wildcard * (the asterisk) can be used as a prefix or suffix, allowing for flexible matches on the URL pathname. Typical examples include /docs/** or **/docs/**.
The metadata sheet is evaluated from top to bottom, site wide meta data set to ** must be before more specific entries.
For each metadata property, create a column in the worksheet and name it using the property you want to assign. Typical examples include template, theme, or robots.
Page-level metadata added via a metadata block takes precedence over bulk metadata. See Authoring and Publishing Content and Metadata (block) for more information.
Note: You need to preview and publish the metadata sheet in order to see changes reflected on your site.
Special Metadata Properties
In addition to all well-known metadata properties, AEM also supports the following properties with special handling:
canonical
The canonical property will be used as the canonical URL in the following tags:
<link rel=”canonical”>
<meta property="og:url">
<meta name="twitter:url">
If not specified, AEM will generate the canonical URL automatically using the configured production domain.
canonical:extension
The canonical:extension property allows you to define the file extension for canonical URLs. This is useful for ensuring consistent and SEO-friendly canonical URLs across your site, even if the actual file paths do not include the extension.
To avoid having to repeat it for many documents, this property is best used in the bulk metadata sheet by adding a column named canonical:extension. For example, to give an .html extension to all canonical URLs on your site, add an entry like this:
description
The description property will will appear as is, but also be used in the following tags:
<meta property="og:description">
<meta name="twitter:description">
If not specified, AEM will use the first text paragraph with 10 words or more found on the page.
image
The image property will be used for the image URL in the following tags:
<meta property="og:image">
<meta property="og:image:secure_url">
`<meta name="twitter:image">
If not specified, AEM will use the first image found on the page. If the page does not contain any images, the default value will be set to /default-meta-image.png. You can add this file via SharePoint, Google Drive, or GitHub, for example.
title
The title property will be used in the following tags:
<meta property="og:title">
<meta name="twitter:title">
<title></title>
If not specified, AEM will use the first Heading 1 (h1) found on the page.
title:suffix
The title:suffix property enables you to automatically append a specified suffix to the title property of your pages. This is useful to apply branding, to add consistent information, or to meet specific SEO requirements across a set of pages.
To avoid having to repeat it for many documents, this property is best used in the bulk metadata sheet by adding a column named title:suffix. For instance, to append | Adobe to the end of all page titles, add an entry like this:
Note: AEM will always insert a space between the title and the suffix.
tags
The tags property can be used to provide a list of tags, separated by commas or as a bullet list. Each tag will be rendered like this:
<meta property="article:tag">
json-ld
The json-ld property can be used to add a JSON schema rendered like this:
<script type=”application/ld+json”>
Note: consider other methods like client-side JavaScript or head.html to add a JSON schema to your page. In many cases, metadata is not the right approach.
Omitting Metadata Values
To explicitly remove metadata a "" can be used as a value. This will remove the element or set the corresponding attribute to "" for a particular path.
Example:
The example above will remove the <link rel="canonical"> from all pages by default, unless there is a specific override for example from a page metadata block.
Additional Metadata
When having metadata that is managed by several teams it is not practical to keep them all in the same metadata files. Multi metadata support is possible by configuring the all the metadata files that need to be taken into account in the /.helix/config.xlsx file:
The order of the entries in the list dictates the order of how the data is applied. The final order of the metadata is as follows:
If there is metadata configured in the /.helix/config.xlsx:
Page level metadata block wins over
Folder-mapped metadata sheet wins over
Metadata sheet(s) in configured order
if there is no configured order:
Page level metadata block wins over
Folder-mapped metadata sheet wins over
Bulk metadata sheet (/metadata.xlsx)
Note that individual metadata properties are overwritten but never deleted. For example, if the /metadata.json defines a property title, the same property in /metadata-2nd.json will overwrite the value, but only if it is not empty.

https://www.aem.live/docs/placeholders

Placeholders
In most websites, there are strings or variables that will be used throughout the site. Especially in sites that need to support multiple languages, it is not a good idea to hard code such values. Instead placeholders can be used and managed centrally.
Note: depending on your site content structure, placeholders might not be in use.
Placeholders can be managed as a spreadsheet that is either in the root folder of the project or in the locales root folder in the case of a multilingual site.
Name the file placeholders for Google Docs.
Name the file placeholders.xlsx for SharePoint.
The spreadsheet has to contain at least two columns titled Key and Text.
The Key column is an identifier that is transformed automatically to be easily accessible via code.
The Text is the literal text (or string) for a placeholder with a given key.
After making changes to your placeholder spreadsheet, you can preview your changes via the sidekick and have your stakeholders check that the new placeholders are working on your .page preview website before publishing the placeholder changes to your production website. See the Sidekick documentation for more information about switching between environments.
Are you a developer and curious to learn how to use placeholders in your code? Look here.

https://www.aem.live/developer/sitemap

Sitemaps
Create automatically generated sitemap files to be referenced from your robots.txt. This helps with SEO and the discovery of new content. AEM can generate three types of sitemaps: without any configuration, based solely on a query index or based on a manual sitemap configuration. A single sitemap must be limited to 50,000 URLs and 50MB (uncompressed) in size - see Limits.
Creating a Sitemap without any configuration
If you don’t do anything you will see your sitemap in sitemap.xml and have a sitemap index in sitemap.json. It will contain a list of all your published documents.
If you started with another type of sitemap and would like to switch to this type, you’ll have to delete the helix-sitemap.yaml configuration file - either manually defined in GitHub or automatically generated - and reindex your site.
Domain name used in external URLs
To customize the domain used in creating external URLs, add a property named cdn.prod.host in your project configuration.
If you are using the configuration service, see here how to update the site configuration.
Otherwise, see here for document-based configuration.
Generating a Sitemap configuration based on an index
Please see the document Indexing to learn more about indexing. In order to generate a sitemap configuration based on an index, please ensure that you have already set up an initial query index as explained there. This will generate a sitemap at the location:
https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/sitemap.xml
And a sitemap configuration at the following location:
https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/helix-sitemap.yaml
It is recommended that you create a sitemap-index.xml file that references all your sitemaps and keep that as part of your project code in your github repo. This way it is easy to add new sitemaps as the project expands.
Manual setup of your Sitemap configuration
If you need more customization than your generated sitemap configuration file provides, you can copy its contents and paste it into a file named helix-sitemap.yaml in the root folder of your project.
Alternatively, if you are using the configuration service, you can also update the sitemap.yaml via the site configuration.
Note: When using a manually configured index and sitemap (e.g. your code repo includes a helix-query.yaml and helix-sitemap.yaml file) your index definition must include the robots property to ensure the sitemap excludes pages with robots: noindex metadata. When using auto-generated index definitions, simply follow the recommendations in the indexing documentation so those pages are excluded from the index.
The following sections contain the supported types of sitemaps.
Simple Sitemap
The following is a simple helix-sitemap.yaml. It assumes a single index containing all the pages that need to appear in the sitemap.
If you want last modification dates to be included in the URLs of your sitemap, add a lastmod property including a format to your configuration.
Multiple Sitemaps
It is common to have sitemaps per section of the sites and/or per country or language. AEM supports sitemaps including the corresponding hreflang references. In the following example we assume that there is a one to one mapping between the indexes and the sitemaps XML files.
If there are two pages in the english and french section that share a common suffix, they will be related, so e.g. if you have a page /welcome in the english section and a page /fr/welcome in the french section, the resulting entry in the /sitemap-en.xml will look like this:
A similar entry will be available in /sitemap-fr.xml.
Specifying the primary language manually
There might be situations where you have alternate versions of a page, but you’re unable to use a common suffix to identify them, possibly because you’re porting a legacy website that should not have its paths changed. In that situation, you can specify a primary-language-url for the alternate location, in the metadata of the document.
Let’s assume our primary language is english, we have a page /welcome in the english section and /fr/bienvenu in the french section, and the latter is an alternate version of the former.
First, we add that information to the document at /fr/bienvenu in its metadata:
This can also be added to a global metadata sheet, as shown in Bulk Metadata.
Then, we add an indexed property primary-language-url to the french index:
Finally, we re-publish the french page, and rebuild the sitemap.
Specifying the default language
Another common requirement is to specify the default language for a sitemap with multiple languages. This can be achieved by adding a property default in the sitemap:
In the resulting sitemap, all entries from the english subtree will have an extra alternate entry with hreflang x-default.
Specifying multiple hreflangs for one subtree
Sometimes, it is required to map multiple hreflangs to only one language subtree, e.g. consider we want the following to appear in the resulting sitemap:
Every page in our sitemap source should appear exactly once, but have multiple alternate hreflangs associated with it. In order to achieve this, you should specify an array of languages in the hreflang property:
Multiple Indexes Aggregated Into One Sitemap
There are cases where it is easier to have a single larger sitemap than fragmented small sitemaps, especially as there is a limit of sitemaps that can be submitted to search engines per site.
The following example shows how to aggregate a number of separate indexes into a single sitemap.
Using the same destination it is possible to combine multiple small sitemaps into one larger sitemap.
Including other sitemaps as input
In a mixed scenario, where not all languages in a sitemap are managed in AEM, you can include sitemaps from other language trees by specifying an XML path as source, as in:
In this example, we use an external french sitemap to calculate all sitemap locations. AEM will determine alternates for english sitemap URLs by deconstructing the french counterparts in external sitemap using the alternate definition.
Adding an extension to all locations in the sitemap
In a scenario, where you want all your locations to have an extension, e.g. .html, and you’re unable to generate a helix-sitemap sheet in your query index to derive a formula, you can add an extension to all languages or an individual language using an extension property:

https://www.aem.live/docs/setup-customer-sharepoint

How to use Sharepoint (application)
NOTE: for projects using Adobe’s Sharepoint please continue here.
If you use SharePoint as your content source, AEM uses a registered Microsoft Azure application to access your content. This application has delegated permissions defined that allow the service to access SharePoint on behalf of a user. This user needs to be registered to the project that is using SharePoint.
Alternatively, the services can also authenticate as an application and use application permissions to access the sites. This needs additional setup by a SharePoint site administrator that can grant the permissions for the application.
The preferred setup is to use application permissions, as this narrows down the access the service has to a specific SharePoint site and does not require to share any secrets of a technical user. Also, it reduces the problems around password rotation.
The following describes how to set up application permissions for your project. If you want to set up a technical user, please continue here.
Setting up SharePoint involves the following steps:
Create or identify a Sharepoint site that will serve as site for the document based authoring
Create a folder within SharePoint that will be the website root.
Set the content source in your site configuration
Access the Registration Portal
Register the Application
Apply the sites.selected permission to the SharePoint site
1. Create or identify a Sharepoint site
Talk to your IT department to either identify or create a Sharepoint site that will be used for document based authoring. One site can “host” multiple websites (projects). This site will later receive the respective permissions so that the publishing services can access it.
2. Create the website root folder
Navigate to your desired location in the SharePoint site created or identified above and create a root folder that will be your website root. It is best to not use a SharePoint list root directly, so that you have a shared space for your authors to put collateral documents, for example a drafts folder, or how-to-author documentations.
An example file structure might look like this, using the website folder as the root:
3. Set the content source in your site configuration
The next step is to set the source property in your site configuration to the corresponding Sharepoint URL(see: https://www.aem.live/docs/admin.html#schema/SiteConfig for more detail)The expected format usually looks like the example below.
This might vary depending on how you create the SharePoint site and lists. In order to obtain the url, the simplest way is to copy-past the first part from the browser address, eg:
And then add the rest manually (Note, that copying the sharelink via the UI adds unnecessary information and it is better to use a canonical representation of the url). Once you compose the url, you can test it by entering it again in the browser. You should end up in the folder view of your website root.
After that, update the source in your site config service via the API accordingly.
An easy way to make this change is to use https://labs.aem.live/tools/site-admin/index.html to either create or update a site configuration.
For example:
Hit save to persist the change.
4. Access the Registration Portal
Overview
In order for the AEM service to access the authored content it needs a couple of information and setup. The AEM service (a cloud function) accesses the MS Graph API on behalf of an application (or configured user). In order to do so, it needs to authenticate first in the context of an Application. This is important because the scopes given to the application define what permission the service has on the MS Graph API. For example, it should be allowed to read and write documents, but not to alter access control.
An application is represented as an “Enterprise Application” in the respective Active Directory of a tenant. The permissions given to that enterprise application ultimately define what the service can access in that tenant’s resources. Certain permissions need to be approved by an Active Directory administrator before a user can use the application. This so-called “admin consent” is a mechanism to verify and control which permissions apps can have. This is to prevent dubious apps from tricking users into trusting an app that is not official. Having the extra admin consent step allows IT security to control which apps the employees can use.
1. Sign-in in the Registration Portal
View Enterprise Applications in Azure Portal
Assuming that so far no AEM Enterprise Applications are present in Azure (Microsoft Entra Id)
Access The Registration Portal
Go to https://admin.hlx.page/register, enter the github url of the project or the org/site values of your site config.
Sign-in as non admin user
Sign in as a user that does not have admin permissions will show an error that it needs approval, i.e. the application needs admin consent.
Problem: Enterprise Application is not registered if a user never logs in.
Sign-in as admin user
One solution is to sign in as a user that does have admin permissions:
(note, at this point the Enterprise Application is still not registered in azure)
AEM Content Integration Registration visible in UI
If the admin logs in (without checking the checkbox and granting consent for everyone), the Enterprise application is present.
Create application using MSGraph or Powershell
Alternatively, you can create the Enterprise application via MSGraph or Powershell.
In order to make it visible in the azure UI you also need to add the WindowsAzureActiveDirectoryIntegratedApp tag. This can be done directly when creating the application.Using graph explorer:
Using powershell:
After that you still need to give admin consent, if you want a non admin user to login.
Also see:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/create-service-principal-cross-tenant
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-configure?pivots=ms-graph
Review permissions
Note that the AEM Content Integration Registration (e34c45c4-0919-43e1-9436-448ad8e81552) application is only needed during registration to verify that the user has read access to the sharepoint. It has the following delegated permissions:
OpenidAllows users to sign in to the app with their work or school accounts and allows the app to see basic user profile information.
ProfileAllows the app to see your users' basic profile (e.g., name, picture, user name, email address)
Files.ReadWrite.AllAllows the app to read, create, update and delete all files the signed-in user can access.
User logged in Registration portal
After completing this initial step, the user is logged in the registration portal
Verify write access to the content source via challenge file
Download the challenge file
Before you can register (or change) the registration. You have to prove that you have write access to the respective sharepoint location. For that you need to upload a text file containing the mentioned content. This can easily be done by downloading the file and drop it into the sharepoint folder.
After that, click on Validate to continue the registration.
Adding the AEM Content Integration App with application permissions
Add Enterprise Application
When logged in the registration portal, the content source that is used by the project needs to be connected to an oauth grant for the AEM Content Integration application. This is needed, so that the system can access the documents in sharepoint and convert them to an internal format (markdown) and store it in Adobe’s storage (S3/R2) for fast delivery.
Using application sites.selected permissions is more secure as it limits the scope to a single sharepoint site. In order to connect, click on the Connect Application button.
If you never registered an application or a user before, you probably see the following error:
or
Same as above, the Enterprise application for the AEM Content Integration (83ab2922-5f11-4e4d-96f3-d1e0ff152856) is not present in Azure yet,In order to add it, use the graph explorer or powershell to add it:
Using graph explorer:
Using powershell:
Also see:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/create-service-principal-cross-tenant
Add Application Roles
Now the enterprise application AEM Content Integration is visible in azure. But it doesn’t have any Sites.Selected application permissions.
Problem: Using the admin consent UI would grant all application and delegated permissions, which we don’t want.
An easy way is to consent to all permissions and then remove the delegated ones again.
Add Application Roles using Powershell or Graph Explorer
Alternatively, adding the app roles can be done with the following steps:
Find the service principal of the enterprise application (principalId). This is the one you created above.
Find the service principal of the Microsoft Graph API (resourceId)
Find the Id for the Sites.Selected Application Role (appRoleId)
Assign the Application Role to the Managed Identity (The Enterprise Application)
Using powershell this can be done with:
Using graph explorer it involves more steps:
Find the principal of the enterprise application for AEM Content Integration :
This will be our principalId
Find the service principal of the Microsoft Graph API
This is the resourceId. (the resource that defines the application role)
Find the id of the application role.GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals/${resourceId}/appRoles
Substitute the resourceId with the service principal of the Microsoft Graph API as obtained from the previous step.
Find the entry for Sites.Selected. This Id is the appRoleId
Assign the Application Role to the Managed Identity. The request has the format:
For example:
Validate Permissions
Eventually you should see the granted application permission in the UI.
Back in the registration portal, they should have changed to:
The content source can't be found or you don't have permission to access it. Please check that the URL is correct, the app "AEM Content Integration (83ab2922-5f11-4e4d-96f3-d1e0ff152856)" has the right permissions, and that the user is allowed to access it..
Add permissions to Sharepoint Site
In order to add the permissions to the sharepoint site, we need to find its SiteId.
This can be done using again the graph explorer:
Example:
Using the Id we can set the permissions:
Note: If you get an “Access Denied” error while executing the above request , you need to have “Site Admin” permissions in order to run the above step. Also you may need to give additional “consent” from the Graph Explorer’s “Modify Permissions” panel for additional “Sites” scopes.
After that, the registration portal should show

https://www.aem.live/docs/go-live-checklist

Go-Live Checklist
The go-live checklist is a summary of best practices to consider when launching a website. These steps are generally good practices but have some aspects specific to Adobe Experience Manager.
Steps Before Go-Live
Content and Design QA
Make sure that your content and design conforms to the specifications and that you are happy with the website you see on your projects .aem.live domain. This may include checks for specific accessibility and SEO requirements of your project.
Performance Validation
Every AEM project should produce a lighthouse score of 100 for mobile and desktop from Google Pagespeed insights on its respective .aem.live site.
See the document Keeping it 100, Web Performance for more information.
Analytics Validation
Make sure that all your analytics setup and the rest of your martech stack is firing as expected and visitor data is visible in your reporting dashboards.In any relaunch of a website the analytics instrumentation will change based on loading sequence and performance.
It is important to expect that the baseline of any metric captured by analytics will change. Contact the corresponding analysts to make sure that the adjustment of the baseline is understood and expected.
Metrics that may change their baselines as reported by analytics may include pageviews, conversion rates, bounce rates, time on page, etc. Depending on the change in loading patterns the baseline of the metrics may go up and down.Bottom of the funnel metrics like checkout, transactions or form submission that are captured by operational systems are not affected and are expected to stay flat past a lift-and-shift launch.
RUM instrumentation
To be able to see performance impact quickly and reliably and to compare before / after launch metrics we recommend instrumenting your website before launch with Real Use Monitoring (RUM), ideally as early as possible. Adding RUM to your existing site is trivial and can give you important operational insights even before launch.
Legacy Redirects
In most migrations there are legacy URLs that are retired. Make sure those are reflected in your redirects spreadsheet (redirects.xlsx in sharepoint or redirects in google), found in your project content folder. Check Google Search Console for the most impactful backlinks (in terms of SEO) to create redirects for.
See the document Redirects for more information.
Sitemap & Robots
For most websites with a significant number of pages, a sitemap is desirable. AEM automatically generates sitemaps from the query index. For multilingual sites, adding hreflang to the sitemap ensures that the website correctly targets the appropriate geographic and language audience, which is essential for SEO and prevents issues like duplicate content across different language versions (aka SEO cannibalisation) and improves the search engine's ability to serve the right version of the content to the right users.
If you have a sitemap that’s generated for your site make sure it is discoverable from your robots.txt. ​​Note that robots.txt is (technically) case sensitive, and a good example is:
Note: aem.page and aem.live are kept hidden from crawlers intentionally, to avoid duplicate content. There is no need to set the robots.txt to Disallow crawlers during development.
It is important to understand that a Disallow in robots.txt is potentially helping with crawler budget issues under certain conditions, but does not prevent a page from being added to the google index, and conversely will make its removal via noindex impossible. URLs of pages that have a Disallow can still be discovered in a SERP.
An effective way to remove a URL from the index is to Allow crawlers and put a noindex robots tag on the page.
Adding a custom robots.txt is done via config service.
See the documents Indexing and Sitemaps for more information.
Canonical URLs
Make sure canonical URLs return 2xx HTML response status code (not 3xx or 4xx) and that they are correctly implemented, which is crucial for preventing duplicate content issues across the site. Proper canonicalization helps search engines understand which versions of similar pages to index and display in search results, directly impacting SEO performance.
See the following external documentation for more information: Consolidate duplicate urls
Favicon
Adding a favicon to your site gives it a professional look in your visitor’s browsers.
See the document Favicon for more information.
Authentication for Authors
By default, authors don’t need to be logged in to use AEM Sidekick. If you decide you want to control who can preview and publish documents this can be configured.
See the document Configuring Authentication for Authors for more information.
SharePoint Access
If your content is in SharePoint, follow this guide to configure dedicated access which you control.
CDN Configuration
One of the last steps in a go-live is usually to update your CDN to point to your aem.live endpoint.
You can either use your existing, self-managed CDN or an Adobe-managed CDN included in your license. See here for details on supported CDN options.
Ideally the CDN configuration is tested in a staging environment to make sure everything works as expected, which includes redirects from www to APEX and vice-versa.
Push Invalidation Setup
Make sure push invalidation is properly set up according to the document Configuring Push Invalidation for BYO Production CDN. Test the setup by publishing a small change and verifying that the change is visible on the production domain.
Notify Engineering On-Call
Notifying the Edge Delivery Services team about your upcoming go-live helps our on-call engineers proactively monitor logs during the event and quickly reach out if any issues arise that we can assist with.
To notify the team, please send an email to aemgolives@adobe.com and include the following information:
Top-level URL(s) that will be going live on Edge Delivery Services
Planned go-live date and time
Primary contact person for the go-live
Teams or Slack channel for real-time collaboration with Engineering
If you do not yet have a collaboration channel set up, please refer to Teams Collaboration for guidance.
If you do not yet have a collaboration channel set up, please refer to Teams Collaboration for guidance.
Post Go-Live Validation
Performance Validation
Validate that the performance is still at a lighthouse score of 100 via pagespeed insights on the production environment. Introducing a CDN layer can have adverse performance effects that are usually visible on the protocol layer. Typical culprits are running HTTP/1.1 or ineffective origin caching as well as bot detection or other libraries injected by the CDN configuration.
Google Search Console
If you have an active Google Search Console with your sitemap uploaded, it may be valuable to get a coverage report and make sure that indexing works as expected. The Google Search Console should be monitored for the weeks after a go-live to track the indexing status of new and updated pages, ensuring they are properly recognized by Google. It's crucial to check for total clicks, total impressions, backlinks changes and crawl errors, as these can significantly impact the site's SEO performance and authority.
Martech and Analytics validation
Certain aspects of your martech stack may be tied to specific origins / hostnames, and operate differently on staging (or .page and .live) hostnames if not configured correctly. It is advisable to make sure that all the important tags in the martech stack fire correctly and the information is continuously collected after a go-live.
404 Report
After a website has been migrated there is usually a set of 404 Not Founds, which should be monitored after the go-live and redirected to popular page URLs. This information can be pulled from your site analytics and the respective Slack bot report. Monitoring this for the weeks after a go-live is recommended.

Configuring push invalidation for BYO production CDN
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes or a developer pushes code changes to the main branch (changes on other branches do not trigger push invalidation).
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Setting up push invalidation requires 2 steps:
Configuration
Opt-In Request Header
Configuration
Push invalidation is currently supported for CDNs of the following vendors:
Fastly
Akamai
Cloudflare
CloudFront
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
The following sections describe the vendor specific properties required to set up push invalidation.
Fastly
Configuration properties:
Create a Fastly API Token
go to Personal API Tokens,
click on "Create Token",
enter a name (e.g. "Production Site Purge Token"),
select "A specific service" and your production service from the drop-down list,
check the "Purge select content (purge_select) — Purge by URL or surrogate key" check box,
select "Never expire",
click on "Create Token",
copy the generated token value shown in the pop-up window.
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
Akamai
Configuration properties
Push invalidation uses the Akamai Fast Purge API, specifically Delete by URL and Delete by cache tag.
The Fast Purge API credentials consist of
They can be generated by following the instructions at Create an API client with custom permissions.

Cloudflare Setup
The following screenshots illustrate how to configure Cloudflare to deliver content. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
This setup can be completely done in the browser by using the Cloudflare Dashboard only. If you are already familiar with Cloudflare Workers, Wrangler & GitHub and not afraid of entering commands in a terminal window you might want to follow the instructions for Cloudflare with wrangler instead.
Create a Cloudflare site
If you already have a Cloudflare site and DNS set up you can skip forward to the Setup push invalidation section.
Enter the domain:
Select a plan:
For this walk-through we’ll use the Free plan.
Setup push invalidation for Cloudflare
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is configured by adding specific properties to the project's configuration:
If you are using the configuration service, see here how to update the CDN configuration.
Otherwise, see here for document-based CDN configuration.
Configuration properties:
values: free, pro, business, enterprise
default: free
To create an API Token,
go to API Tokens
click on "Create Token",
go to "Create Custom Token" at the bottom and click on "Get started"
enter a token name (e.g. "Production Site Purge Token"),
Permissions: "Zone", "Cache Purge", "Purge"
Zone Resources: "Include", "Specific zone", "<your production zone>"
click on "Continue to summary"
click on "Create Token",
copy the generated token value.
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
DNS Setup
For a new site, we’ll start with a simple DNS setup.
Create a new CNAME record. If your zone is mysite.com and you want to serve traffic on www.mysite.com, then the name should be www
If you want to serve traffic on example.com (without a www) then the name should be @
And if you want to serve traffic on all subdomains, then the name should be *
As we are using workers to serve the content, the value of the Content field does not matter. It’s easiest to use your ref--repo--owner.aem.live host name here. This is a hostname, not a URL, so leave out the leading https://
Make sure the CNAME record is Proxied:
SSL/TLS Setup
Select SSL/TLS from the left pane and Edge Certificates in the dropdown list. On the right side, scroll down to Always Use HTTPS and enable the setting:
Configure Caching
Navigate to Caching → Configuration and adjust following settings:
Caching Level: Standard
Browser Cache TTL: Respect Existing Headers
Create Cache Rules
Next browse to Caching → Cache Rules and create a new cache rule
Note: Enable Origin Cache Control option is only available for enterprise accounts. Free, Pro, and Business customers have this option enabled by default and cannot disable it.
Following settings should apply:
When incoming requests match: hostname contains mydomain.com
Then: Eligible for cache
Under Browser TTL, click "add setting", then apply "Respect Origin TTL"
Create Worker
Return to the Cloudflare Dashboard homepage, then navigate the sidebar: Workers & Pages → Overview. Click "create" to create a new worker.
On the next screen, click "create worker", because that's what you want to achieve.
Enter a name for the worker (e.g. aem-worker) and click on “Deploy”:
On the next screen, click "Edit code"
Edit worker code
Copy the content of this file.
In the left pane, replace the existing content with the copied content.
Click on “Deploy”
Confirm with "Save and Deploy"
Note: If you are using the recommended content-security-policy with ‘strict-dynamic’ and (cached) nonce , please make sure to use the latest worker code, which removes the header in 304 responses, to ensure that there is no mismatch between the nonce cached in your site user’s browser and the one returned by the server.
Return to your worker (by clicking the back arrow in the top right corner), then click on Settings → Variables and “Add variable”:Add a variable ORIGIN_HOSTNAME and set the value to the hostname of your origin (e.g. main--mysite--aemsites.aem.live):
If you have enabled push invalidation, add a second environment variable PUSH_INVALIDATION = enabled.
Apply the changes by clicking "Deploy".
Next, click on Triggers an select “Add route”:
Enter your domain route (e.g. www.mydomain.com/*), select your zone and confirm with “Add route”:
Depending on the setup chosen in DNS Setup, you would select routes www.mydomain.com/* or mydomain.com/*
Warning: if you select *.mydomain.com/* as Cloudflare suggests in the field default, your site will be available under multiple subdomains. This will invite attackers trying to open webmail.mydomain.com and similar sites, and lead to duplicate content, potentially depressing your search engine rankings.After completing all steps you should be all set.
Optional: Authenticate Origin Requests
When using token-based Site Authentication, add the following to enable authenticated requests from Cloudflare to AEM.
Return to Workers → <your worker> → Settings → Variables
Create a new environment variable ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION
Paste the site token value from token-based Site Authentication (it starts with hlx_)
Confirm by clicking "Deploy"
Expanding the AEM footprint on your website
In case you start with having only a portion of the website being routed to your .live origin and have routed a specific folder (eg. /blog/*) you can subsequently add more routes whenever you are ready to expose new sections of the site by simply adding more routes and repeat the last “add route” steps as needed, without changing your worker configuration.
Watch out for duplicate content
Search engines often penalize sites for duplicate content, so it's important to make sure your content is not available on the web elsewhere. Cloudflare, unfortunately, has a default setting that will expose your site on additional network ports. In paid Cloudflare plans you can block traffic on these additional ports. This is a recommended setting for production sites.

Configuration properties:
This setting will ensure that Akamai authenticates requests from your CDN to the AEM Origin, which validates the token received in the Authorization header.
Caveats
Do not enable Akamai mPulse Real Usage Monitoring. While the performance impact on most sites is negligible, for sites built for consistent high performance, enabling it will prevent reaching a Lighthouse Score of 100. In AEM, you have a Real Use Monitoring service built-in, so that dual instrumentation will be unnecessary and is strongly discouraged.
Also, do not enable Akamai Bot Manager Premier (also called “Transactional Endpoint Protection”) or similar Web Application Firewall offerings, as they markedly interfere with rendering performance and user experience. Your site on AEM is protected against bot attacks on the backend, so that this performance cost comes with negligible benefit.
Setup push invalidation for Akamai
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).

Special Mention - Akamai Edge-Control Headers
AEM uses a fine tuned, production hardened way to supply caching information that applies to the specific CDN, in conjunction with our reliable push invalidation. This allows us to improve cache efficiency and consistency over traditional TTL based approaches.
Every CDN vendor supports a way to directly influence how to instruct caching and we are excited to see standardization efforts like "Targeted Cache Control" (TCC) being on the roadmap for Akamai (see: https://www.akamai.com/blog/news/targeted-cache-control), in the meantime we are using Akamai's long-term supported Edge-Control header.

Ignore if set: no
Priority: 10
Note
Your Fastly setup should not use Fastly’s Next Generation Web Application Firewall for requests that are going against aem.live or any other Edge Delivery Services origin. Enabling WAF with Edge Delivery Services can lead to erroneous content being delivered.
Edge Delivery Services needs no Web Application Firewall, as it is running on hardened, shared, and ultra-scalable infrastructure. Requests that a WAF would typically intercept are terminated in our CDNs.

https://www.aem.live/docs/redirects

Redirects
Every website has the need for redirects. For example if you relocate or delete content, you want your users to still be able to find it or the next best thing. See the document Authoring and Publishing Content for more information on deleting content.
You can intuitively manage redirects as a spreadsheet called redirects (or redirects.xlsx) in the root of your project folder.
The spreadsheet has to contain at least two columns titled Source and Destination.
The Source is relative to the domain of your website, so it only contains the relative path.
The Destination can be either a fully qualified URL if you are redirecting to a different website, or it can be a relative path if you are redirecting within your own website.
After making changes to your redirects spreadsheet, you can preview your changes via the sidekick and have your stakeholders check that the redirects are working on your .page preview website before publishing the redirect changes to your production website. See the Sidekick documentation for more information about switching between environments.Redirects take precedence over existing content, which means that if you have an existing page with a given URL, defining a redirect for that same URL will serve the redirect for that page and “hide” the existing page. Conversely if a redirect that has been set up on an existing page is removed, the existing page will be served again, unless the page was unpublished.
Remember that if your redirect workbook has multiple pages (worksheets), then the redirects will only work on the sheet that is called helix-default. This allows you to manage more complex redirects through spreadsheet formulas. The spreadsheets and JSON documentation page has all the details.
Wildcards Redirects
Wildcard redirects have a set of issues around (a) unmanaged complexity and accumulate tech debt over time, (b) introducing potential redirect loops and also tend to (c) 301 into 404. For those reasons we generally recommend avoiding patterns-based wildcard redirects, and instead create redirects based on actual "usage" data.
However there are some cases where individually managed redirects are inflating the list of redirects, and for practical or perceived initial simplicity reasons it may be compelling to use pattern based redirects. For example, you might want to apply a redirect to all pages under a specific path, regardless of the exact URL. This is where using wildcards in your CDN can be helpful. Wildcards allow you to match multiple URLs under a common path, simplifying the redirection of entire sections of your site.
Example: If you want to redirect all URLs under /old-path/ to /new-path/, including any subpages (e.g., /old-path/page1, /old-path/page2), you can configure a wildcard redirect in your CDN.
Input URL pattern: /old-path/*
Redirect to: /new-path/$1
The wildcard (*) captures anything after /old-path/, and $1 represents the captured part of the URL, ensuring the structure is maintained in the new location.
Keep in mind that redirecting this way usually redirects the entire namespace and hence creates redirects (301) into 404 for an infinite number of URLs and may therefore lead to undesirable results.
Note: The specifics of configuring these redirects depend on the CDN provider you are using. Different vendors may have their own syntax, interface, and capabilities for handling wildcards and advanced redirect rules. Always consult the documentation of your specific CDN for guidance on how to implement wildcard redirects.
Site Migrations and SEO
When migrating your site to AEM Edge Delivery Services, this may necessitate some changes to the URLs your site uses. This can have an impact on SEO, so it is important that you plan for this carefully to avoid any disruption. We recommend the following steps to handle the most common scenarios:
Add your most popular URLs to the redirects sheet to ensure these are handled properly via 301 redirects
If the change to URLs follows a common pattern, for example, removing .html from all urls, set this up as a wildcard redirect at your CDN
If the change includes more complex situations than a common pattern, best practice is to map the old and new URLs 1-to-1.
If you are pruning content as part of your migration, avoid the temptation to redirect these urls to a common destination such as your home page; See the “Avoid irrelevant redirects” note in Google's documentation on site moves for more information
Ensure your sitemap is up to date
After go-live, monitor 404s via Operational Telemetry and add missing redirects as needed
For more information, see Google's documentation on site moves.

AEM Sidekick Security
This page describes security aspects of the Sidekick such as required browser permissions, privacy and network requests being made during operation.
You can also refer to the following resources for additional information:
The listing page in Google Chrome Web Store
The manifest file on GitHub (open source)
The extension’s context menu
Browser Permissions
The Sidekick requires the following browser permissions as defined in its manifest file to function as expected:
Required to persist the following:
state settings (local storage)
project configurations (synchronized across devices)
access tokens (session storage)
Required hosts:
http://localhost:3000/* (see Local Development)
https://*/* (used to determine whether to show or hide the Sidekick based on a tab’s URL)
Privacy
The Sidekick collects user activity allowing Adobe to:
Learn how users interact with the UI
Enhance the user experience in future releases
All data collected is:
Minimal: names of actions users click in the user interface and target URLs.
Sampled: only every 10th interaction triggers data collection.
Anonymous: no PII is being transmitted or stored.
Secure: Data is transmitted using HTTPS and only authorized Adobe personnel have access to stored data.
Adobe further declares that user data is:
Not being sold to third parties
Not being used or transferred for purposes that are unrelated to the item's core functionality
Not being used or transferred to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes
Network Requests
The Sidekick performs HTTPS request to the following hosts:
Restricting Access
You can restrict the Sidekick’s access to certain hosts for all users in your enterprise by defining the runtime_blocked_hosts and runtime_allowed_hosts settings in your enterprise’s Chrome profile. See Google’s documentation on Managing Extensions in Your Enterprise for more information.
Example 1: Allow everything, deny few
This would prevent the Sidekick extension from interacting with any URL matching https://intranet.example.com/* or https://extranet.example.com/*.
Example 2: Deny everything, allow few
This would prevent the Sidekick extension from interacting with any URL, except the ones matching a pattern defined in runtime_allowed_hosts. This example uses a combination of the host_permissions in the manifest file and the list of URLs from the chapter Network Requests above to ensure maximum functionality and an optimal user experience.
Security Audits
The Sidekick’s entire source code is publicly available and – like all of AEM – subject to regular audits performed by 3rd party security researchers. Reports can be shared with customers and prospects under NDA.

https://www.aem.live/developer/sidekick-development

Extending the Sidekick
The goal of this document is to explain how developers can interact with the sidekick, and how it can be customized at a project level.
Events
The sidekick emits the following events:
(object) An object with the following properties:
(string) sourceUrl: The source URL
(string) targetUrl: The target URL
(object) An object with the following properties:
(object) config: The sidekick configuration
(object) location: The location object
(object) status: The status object
An event’s payload can be found in the event.detail property.
Listening for Events
In your project code (e.g. in /scripts/scripts.js), you can react to sidekick events as follows (replace foo with the name of the event you want to listen for):
Customizing the Sidekick
You can customize the sidekick for your project. You can add a /tools/sidekick/config.json configuration file to your project's GitHub repository or use the configuration service.
For all available configuration options, see the config schema. Here are some basics to get you started:
Host Settings
Note: The following host properties are optional in the sidekick configuration and should only be used to explicitly override the CDN settings in your site configuration:
host (string) The host name of the production website (overrides cdn.prod.host)
previewHost (string) The host name of the preview environment (overrides cdn.preview.host, defaults to *.aem.page)
liveHost (string) The host name of the live environment (overrides cdn.live.host, defaults to *.aem.live)
reviewHost (string) The host name of the review environment (overrides cdn.review.host, defaults to *.aem.reviews)
Plugins
Plugins allow you to add custom functionality to the sidekick, enhancing your users’ experience.
Common Plugin Properties
The following properties are applicable to all plugin types:
id (string) is mandatory and must be unique within a sidekick configuration.
title (string) will be shown on the plugin button.
titleI18n (object<string, string>) defines optionally translated titles.
pinned (boolean) determines if the plugin is pinned to the toolbar (default) or folded into the … menu.
environments (string[]) specifies where the plugin should appear (dev, edit, admin, preview, live, or prod).
exclude_paths (string[]) defines patterns to exclude the plugin based on the path in the current tab’s URL.
include_paths (string[]) defines patterns to include the plugin based on the path in the current tab’s URL.
URL-based Plugins
You can specify a url that will be opened in a new tab when the plugin button is clicked:
The following properties are specific to URL-based plugins:
passConfig (boolean) pass the project configuration via query parameters
passReferrer (boolean) pass the originating URL via query parameters
Event-based Plugins
Alternatively, you can specify the name of an event to be fired when the plugin button is clicked. This allows the execution of custom JavaScript code in the context of your page by listening for the event on the sidekick element. Custom events will have a custom: prefix. For your convenience, the custom event dispatched contains a copy of the current sidekick state.
Note: Event-based plugins can only be used in the following environments: Development, Preview, Live and Production. Executing custom code is not possible in Edit or Admin.
In your project code (e.g. in /scripts/scripts.js), you can react to the event as follows:
Special Plugin Types
Palette Plugins
Palettes are variants of URL-based plugins which load the configured URL inside a floating palette instead of opening a new tab.
isPalette (boolean) opens the target of a URL-based plugin in a palette instead of a new tab.
paletteRect (string) optionally defines the size and position of the palette in the format of a DOMRect.
The following example creates a standard palette placed at the bottom left of the window:
If you wish to change the size and positioning of your palette, use paletteRect:
Popover Plugins
Popovers are variants of URL-based plugins which load the configured URL inside a popover instead of opening a new tab. Popovers are centered above the plugin's button.
isPopover (boolean) opens the target of a URL-based plugin in a popover instead of a new tab.
popoverRect (string) optionally defines the width and height of the popover in the format of a DOMRect.
If you wish to change the width or height of your palette, use popoverRect:
A theme query parameter is appended to the URL to style the iframe in line with the current sidekick theme. If no background color is set on the content’s body, it will inherit the popover’s translucent background.
Container Plugins
Containers allow you grouping plugins together and help save space in the toolbar. Clicking a container plugin simply toggles its dropdown, it can’t have its own URL or event action.
isContainer (boolean) renders a plugin as a dropdown instead of a button.
containerId (string) adds a plugin to a container plugin with the specified ID.
The following example creates a container named “Tools” and places a plugin “Foo” in it:
Badge Plugins
Badges allow you to add labels to the sidekick under certain conditions. They will be rendered on the right hand side of the toolbar. Badges have a merley decorative purpose and can’t be clicked.
isBadge (boolean) renders a plugin as a badge instead of a button.
badgeVariant (string) optionally determines the badge’s color scheme (gray, red, orange, yellow, chartreuse, celery, green, seafoam, cyan, blue, indigo, purple, fuchsia, or magenta)
The following example adds a “Stage” badge to the sidekick in the preview environment:
Custom Edit URLs
If your project does not use SharePoint or Google Drive as content source, you can tell the sidekick how to link to your custom editing environment when the user clicks Edit.
The following two config options are available:
editUrlLabel (string) set the label visible to the user
editUrlPattern (string) defines an URL pattern for the custom editing environment. Supports placeholders like {{contentSourceUrl}} or {{pathname}}.
Special Views
You can specify a special view for the sidekick to redirect to when the current tab’s URL matches a certain pattern. This can help you provide a seamless user experience across different media types, and also enables the execution of custom code (event-based plugins). The original resource URL will be available in a url query parameter.
The properties path and viewer are mandatory. Optionally, you can specify a title that will be shown at the top, and you can provide localized titles in a titleI18n object:
At the path specified by viewer, add an HTML file to your GitHub repository, for example:
Add an optional CSS file in the same directory, and a JS file with your custom logic, for example:
Development Workflow
The following workflows are designed for detached sidekick development to prevent unintentional disruptions for the authors on your production site:
Using a Site Copy
If your site’s configuration is stored in the Configuration Service, you can use temporary site copies for sidekick development:
Create a copy of your site in the Configuration Service. For example, if the name of your original site is site1, you could create a site1-dev, reusing the same code and content.
Open the preview URL for site1-dev in your browser: https://main--site1-dev--org.aem.page.
Make your desired changes to the sidekick object in the site1-dev configuration.
Refresh the browser tab after each change to test your changes.
When done, copy the sidekick object from site1-dev to the site1 configuration to roll your changes out to all authors.
Note: When using the sidekick in an editor environment (Google Drive or Microsoft Sharepoint), it will load the config from the original site by default. If you want the sidekick to let you choose which configuration to load, first add the new site to your sidekick from the preview or live URL. Now the sidekick will display a picker with all matching sites.
Using a Repository Branch
If your site’s configuration is not stored in the Configuration Service, you can use a branch in GitHub for sidekick development:
On your site’s GitHub repository, create a branch from main. For this example, we’ll use dev as the branch name.
Open the preview URL for the dev branch in your browser: https://dev--site1--org.aem.page.
Open or create the following file in your repository: /tools/sidekick/config.json.
Make your desired changes to the sidekick configuration file and push changes to the dev branch.
Refresh the browser tab after each change to test your changes.
When done, create a pull request and merge the changes to the main branch of your repository.
Caution: Never commit directly to the main branch in your original repository. Always create a branch and ask for a review of your changes via pull request before merging into main.
Note: When using the sidekick in an editor environment (Google Drive or Microsoft Sharepoint), it will load the config from the original site by default. If you want the sidekick to let you choose which configuration to load, first add the new site to your sidekick from the preview or live URL. Now the sidekick will display a picker with all matching sites.

What is the Sidekick Library?
The Sidekick Library is an extension for the AEM Sidekick that enables developers to create UI-driven tooling for content authors. It includes a built-in blocks plugin that can display a list of all blocks to authors in an intuitive manner, removing the need for authors to remember or search for every variation of a block. Developers can also write their own plugins for the sidekick library.
How to use the Sidekick Library?
The steps below detail how to setup the sidekick library and configure the blocks plugin.
Library Sheet Setup
The sidekick library is populated with your plugins and plugin content using a sheet.
1. Start by creating a directory in sharepoint or gdrive where you want to store the content for the library. We recommend storing the content in /tools/sidekick (or any other name) in the root of the mountpoint. The next steps will assume the directory is called /tools/sidekick.
2. Next, create a workbook (an Excel file) in the /tools/sidekick directory called library (or any other name). Each sheet in the workbook represents a plugin that will be loaded by the Sidekick Library. The name of the sheet determines the name of the plugin that will be loaded. Any data contained in the sheet will be passed to the plugin when loaded. The plugin sheet name must be prepended with helix-. For example, if you want to load a plugin called tags, you would create a sheet named helix-tags.
3. For this tutorial we will create a sheet for our blocks plugin. Create a sheet (or rename the default sheet) and call it `helix-blocks` and leave it empty for now.
Blocks Plugin
The Sidekick library comes with a blocks plugin.
Blocks Plugin Setup
To generate content for the blocks plugin, you need to prepare a separate Word document for each block you want to include.
1. Create a directory inside the /tools/sidekick directory where you will store all the block variations. For example, you could create a directory called blocks inside /tools/sidekick.2. For this example, let's assume we want to define all the variations of a block called columns. First create a Word document called columns inside the blocks directory and provide examples of all the variations of the columns block. After each variation of the block add in a section delimiter.3. Preview and publish the columns document.4. Open the library workbook created in the last section, inside the helix-blocks sheet, create two columns named name and path.6. Next we need to add a row for our columns block. Add the name of the block in the first column and the url to the document that defines the block variations in the second column. For instance, if you want to add the columns block, you could create a row with the name Columns and the path /tools/sidekick/blocks/columns. In order for the library to work across environments (page, live, prod) you should not use an absolute url for the path column.7. Preview and publish the library workbook.
> Since the example blocks are being published you should use bulk metadata to exclude the content inside of /tools/** from being indexed.
Example library.xlsx
Library Metadata
The blocks plugins supports a special type of block called library metadata which provides a way for developers to tell the blocks plugin some information about the block or how it should be rendered.
Supported library metadata options
Default Library metadata vs Library metadata
There are two types of library metadata. Library metadata that lives within a section containing the block, or default library metadata that applies to the document as a whole and lives in a section on it's own (a block called library metadata as the only child in a section).
Let's take an example of a hero block that has 5 variants. Suppose you want to add the same description for each variation of the block, rather than duplicating the library metadata with the description into each section containing the variations. You could instead use default library metadata to apply the same description to every variation of the block. If you decide that one variation actually needs a slightly different description you could add library metadata to the section containing the variation and it would override the default library metadata description when it's rendered within the blocks plugin.
Authoring block names and descriptions using Library Metadata
By default the block name (with variation) will be used to render the item in the blocks plugin. For example, if the name of the block is columns (center, background) then that name will be used as the label when it’s rendered in the blocks plugin. This can be customized by creating a library metadata section within the same section as the block. Library metadata can also be used to author a description of the block as well as adding searchTags to include an alias for the block when using the search feature.
Example block with custom name and description
Content
Display
Autoblocks and Default Content
The blocks plugin is capable of rendering default content and autoblocks. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to place your default content or autoblock within a dedicated section, which should include a library metadata table defining a name property, as previously described. If no name is specified in the library metadata, the item will be labeled as "Unnamed Item."
Blocks composed of content in subsequent sections
There are situations where developers may want a block to consist of content from subsequent sections. This pattern is discouraged for reasons stated here, but if you choose to use it the blocks plugin can render these items using the include next sections property in library metadata.
Templates
Templates are a way to group an entire document into a single element in the sidekick library. To mark a document as a template set type to template in default library metadata.
> Important, the library metadata needs to be in it's own section and be the only child to be considered default library metadata.
Supporting metadata is also desirable for templates. To add a metadata table to the template you can use a Page metadata block.
When the template is copied a metadata with the values will be added along with the content to the clipboard.
Sidekick plugin setup
Since the sidekick library is hosted on the same origin as the content, a static HTML page needs to be created to load and configure the content.
1. Create a file called library.html in tools/sidekick/;
2. Paste the following code in library.html.
In the code above we load the sidekick library from aem.live and then create a custom sidekick-library element and add it to the page. The sidekick-library element accepts a config object that is required to configure the sidekick library.
Supported configuration parameters
The blocks plugin supports the following configuration properties that can be set using the plugins object.
Blocks plugin configuration parameters
Examples
Encoding images
Custom viewports (short form)
Custom viewports
Custom table header colors
You can customize the table header background and foreground color when pasting a block, section metadata or metadata that was copied from the blocks plugin.
Default styles can be set in library.html using css variables.
These values can be overridden using library metadata.
> Depending on the system color scheme selected for the users computer (dark mode), Word may alter the chosen colors in an attempt to improve accessibility.
Custom plugin setup
The example below defines a tags plugin in the config. The keys of the plugins object must match the name of the plugin, any other properties defined in the plugin object will be available to the plugin via the context argument of the decorate method.
Extended Libraries
In some cases merging two block libraries may be desirable. When an extended library is defined the sidekick library application will merge the base library and the extended library together into a single library list for authors.
The example below defines a base library and an extended library (on another origin) that will be merged into the base library.
> The Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers will need to be set on the library.json and blocks of the extended library in order for them to load in the sidekick library. See Custom HTTP Response Headers for more info.
> Due to same-origin policies enforced by browsers on iframes a preview of an extended block cannot be loaded at this time.
Sidekick config.json setup
Next, in order for the sidekick library to appear in the sidekick a config file needs to be created at tools/sidekick/config.json. This config file needs to be created in the code bus and should be checked into github.
The url property in the plugin configuration indicates the location from which the sidekick should load the plugin. This should point to the library.html file we previously created.
> The sidekick config must be checked into the main branch in order to for the plugin to appear in the sidekick.
> If the tools/sidekick/config.json file does not exist in your github repository, it must be created. For more information on sidekick plugin configuration options, see the docs.
Considerations when building blocks for the library
The sidekick library renders blocks by first fetching the plain.html rendition of the the block and then strips it of any other blocks in the content (for example if there are multiple variations of a block in the response). It then requests the same page (without .plain.html) and replaces the main element with the stripped block and loads the entire document into an iframe using the srcdoc attribute.
Use of window.location
Since the block is loaded in an iframe using the srcdoc attribute, the instance of the window.location object used by your sites code will not contain the typical values you would expect to see.
Example window.location object when running in the library
For this reason, if your block requires use of the window.location object we recommend adding the following functions to your scripts.js file and importing them into your function for use.
Use of createOptimizedPicture in lib-aem
The createOptimizedPicture function in lib-aem also uses window.location.href. If you are using this function we recommend moving it into scripts.js and modify it to use the getHref() function above.
Checking for the presence of the sidekick library
Sometimes you may want to know if the page or the block is running in the sidekick library. To do this there are a couple of options.
1. Check if window.location.href === 'about:srcdoc'
2. The main element and the block element will contain the sidekick-library class
Building a Plugin
Developing a plugin is similar to constructing a block in AEM. Once a user tries to load the plugin, the sidekick library will trigger the decorate() method on your plugin. This method receives the container to render the plugin in and any data that is included in the plugins sheet.
> The decorate() function must be exported from the plugin.
Plugin default export & search
The default export from a plugin allows authors to customize the plugin name displayed in the header upon loading, as well as activate the search functionality within the sidekick library.
When the searchEnabled property is true, the library header will display a search icon upon loading the plugin. If the user initiates a search by entering a query, the decorate() function of the plugin will be triggered again, this time with the search string passed in the query parameter of the decorate() function.
Plugin web components
Plugin authors can utilize a select set of web components from Spectrum when building a custom plugin.
The following components from Spectrum are available
The following icons from Spectrum are also available
Plugin Events
Plugin authors can dispatch events from their plugin to the parent sidekick library in order to display a loader or to show a toast message.

Frequently Asked Questions
General Questions
Why was this site renamed from Helix to Franklin to Edge Delivery Services?
Franklin and Helix were internal project names for the Adobe Experience Manager engineering team’s initiative to develop an innovative publishing and delivery service situated at the edge. Between 2022 and 2023, Adobe worked with select clients to test these capabilities, focusing on integrating diverse content sources and delivering web experiences that surpass the performance of a significant majority.
In October 2023, Adobe officially introduced Edge Delivery Services and document-based authoring as part of Adobe Experience Manager, marking the transition from the Franklin and Helix project names to a fully integrated solution.
What makes Edge Delivery Services websites so fast?
Edge Delivery Services optimizes web performance through a combination of caching and real-time content rendering at the edge. To maintain high speed, it continuously monitors site performance using strictly necessary operational telemetry and enforces automated performance checks via Google PageSpeed Insights on every code update (pull request).
Want to keep your site fast? Check out the Keeping It 100 guide.
Is Edge Delivery Services a Static Site Generator (SSG)?
No, Edge Delivery Services is not a Static Site Generator. Unlike traditional SSGs that require a full rebuild to update content, Edge Delivery Services dynamically renders and serves content at the edge, enabling instant updates without the need for a time-consuming build process.
Is Edge Delivery Services a Headless CMS, like AEM?
Edge Delivery Services is not a Headless CMS but rather the “head,” leveraging a CMS or document-based authoring as the content source.

Use Cases
Is Edge Delivery Services better for large or small sites?
Edge Delivery Services is a great solution for both small and large sites. Small sites benefit from its ease of setup, while large sites can take advantage of its ability to support many authors, frequent updates, and high traffic.
How big are the biggest Edge Delivery Services sites?
The biggest sites have over 100k pages and hundreds of authors.
Is Edge Delivery Services a good solution for landing pages?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services is well-suited for landing pages. Adobe uses pages.adobe.com to manage hundreds of landing pages, each owned and maintained by independent teams.
Is Edge Delivery Services a good fit for sites with dozens or hundreds of local markets, languages, or sub-brands?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services is a great solution for global enterprises managing multiple markets, languages, and sub-brands. It supports centralized content management and inheritance, enabling global updates while allowing local teams to make adjustments. Content rollout and localization can be integrated with existing translation memory systems in content sources like SharePoint and Google Drive.
Learn more on the Translation and Localization page.
Is Edge Delivery Services a suitable platform for small e-commerce websites?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services can be used for e-commerce websites. It supports integration with payment services like Stripe and Square.
Can Edge Delivery Services generate content for external platforms like GitBook?
Yes, but Edge Delivery Services no longer natively supports Markdown documents in GitHub as a content source. To publish content from GitHub, Markdown documents must first be copied to a supported authoring environment where they can be previewed and published.
Does Edge Delivery Services support content approval workflows?
Edge Delivery Services does not provide built-in content approval workflows, but instead delegates workflow management to the content source.
For document review and approval processes within SharePoint or Google Drive, we recommend Adobe Workfront.
Site Configuration and Management
How can I manage multiple subdomains?
Edge Delivery Services allows customers to use their own CDN to deliver content under their own domains or subdomains (BYO Production CDN).
Sites can be created with different code repositories or via repoless and point the site configuration to different CDN endpoints for Push Invalidation.
Learn more on the BYO CDN Setup page.
How does Edge Delivery Services handle inheritance and rollouts across multiple sites?
Edge Delivery Services has a broad range of facilities for centralized content and code management, allowing updates to be shared across multiple sites while still allowing for localized adjustments. AEM Universal Editor or Document Authoring have out of the box solutions for existing inheritance and content rollouts.
Can Edge Delivery Services be used along other CMS platforms on the same site?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services can be used alongside other CMS platforms when managed at the CDN tier. Many large, mature sites combine content from multiple origins, allowing different sections to be powered by separate AEM projects or external CMS solutions.
It helps to have top-level paths (sections of a site) be delivered from the same CMS so that CDN configurations will be easier to manage as opposed to a random list of URLs with no common parent in the URL.
Can Edge Delivery Services support secure content access for intranets, portals, or closed user groups?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services can support secure content access for intranets, portals, and closed user groups. Customer-specific authentication and authorization are typically enforced at the CDN tier, where all CDN vendors offer a broad set of integrations with existing identity providers.
In Edge Delivery Services, access to .page and .live origins can be restricted (independently), ensuring that content is only accessible through the CDN with the necessary authentication in place.
Learn more on the Configuring Site Authentication page.
How does Edge Delivery Services handle access control and multi-tenant authoring?
Edge Delivery Services follows the access control model of its connected content source. For example, SharePoint and Google Drive provide robust enterprise-level permissions that users and system administrators are already familiar with. For partial page access control, fragments are recommended to isolate content with different access control into separate documents. Separate teams can control their own content within their assigned folders, ensuring isolated workflows.
Access to specific blocks can be restricted (via the content library) and blocks can also be configured to prevent rendering in specific sections of a site.
What is the best way to fetch backend data?
The client (browser) requests data from backend systems. If authentication is required, a middleware layer running on the Edge/CDN (e.g., Edge Workers) acts as an intermediary, managing authentication and facilitating communication between the client and backend.
Browser → Middleware (Edge Worker) → Backend
Does Edge Delivery Services support server-side customizations or includes (SSI/ESI)?
Edge Delivery Services renders semantic markup (excluding fragments) on the server-side, but it does not support any server-side customizations or includes. Instead, it generates optimized, static markup that can be adjusted on the client side for styling, functionality, and personalization. While some customer CDNs support ESI, it generally introduces performance and complexity trade-offs and we have found no benefit to metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) or Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) when using ESI over client-side includes. Because of this, we do not recommend using ESI and advise against it.
How does Edge Delivery Services support taxonomy management?
Edge Delivery Services supports taxonomy management through structured metadata and hierarchical tagging. Common approaches include managing taxonomies in spreadsheets or documents to define hierarchical structures and adding tags to metadata of pages or content fragments.
External taxonomy systems or APIs can be embedded into the authoring environment as a Sidekick plugin. AI-based tagging can be implemented as an authoring plugin or directly in the delivery tier, depending on the use case.
How does Edge Delivery Services handle caching and content invalidation?
Edge Delivery Services uses caching to optimize performance while ensuring content updates are reflected quickly. When authors publish changes, the system automatically, and surgically purges cached content at multiple levels, including the CDN.
For BYO CDNs (including Cloudflare, Fastly, Akamai, and CloudFront), push invalidation can be enabled to purge content by URL and cache key whenever updates are published. Learn more on the Configuring Push Invalidation page.
How can I confirm that a push invalidation token is working?
You can use the CDN Setup tool to confirm that your CDN automatically purges outdated content when content changes are published. This tool validates your project’s vendor-specific properties and credentials.
How does the development flow look like? Is it independent of the authoring flow?
The development flow can be completely separated from the authoring flow. However, it's important to note that AEM allows parallelizing content authoring and development and thereby significantly reduces project durations. Authors and developers are encouraged to collaborate closely to ensure an optimal outcome.
See Best Practices and Anatomy of a Project for more details.
What content should be created by an author versus a developer?
Authors create content in the chosen authoring environment, while developers build site functionality using CSS and JavaScript in GitHub.
Authors and developers also create work in progress content for new features in /drafts/ folder for testing, training and development.
Is Edge Delivery Services down right now?
Edge Delivery Services is probably not down, but you can always check Adobe’s status page for real-time service updates and interruption notifications.
Indexing and SEO
What are the best practices for search engine optimization (SEO)?
Add metadata to your pages using the metadata block and metadata sheet to improve indexing. Ensure your site achieves strong Core Web Vitals (CWV) scores for fast loading and a smooth user experience. Use clear headings, alt text for images, and descriptive URLs.
How do I optimize Edge Delivery Services pages for social media sharing on platforms like Facebook and Twitter?
Set a default placeholder image to ensure consistent previews. Use the metadata block and metadata sheet to define the title, description, and other page metadata.
Can I retrieve a list of pages within a folder?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services can generate an index (or multiple indices) of pages within a folder, storing the data in a spreadsheet and serving it as JSON.
Learn more on the Indexing page.
How does Google index Edge Delivery Services pages?
Search engines, like Google, index Edge Delivery Services pages the same way they index traditional web pages by crawling the published content and evaluating metadata, page structure, and performance metrics like Core Web Vitals.
Can Google index Edge Delivery Services pages that load content fragments dynamically?
Yes, Google can index Edge Delivery Services pages that load content fragments dynamically via the fetch API. However, to avoid duplicate indexing issues, it is recommended to disable indexing for fragment URLs using the noindex directive in metadata.
How should additional fields be queried when all pages are stored in a single index?
Edge Delivery Services supports querying specific fields within a single index and suggests creating additional indexes when needed. Best practices include creating one index per language and additional dedicated indexes for common queries.
How can I include specific sections of a site in query-index.json for indexing?
Edge Delivery Services supports indexing parts of the site by configuring an index at that path of the content or via a custom index configuration.
Learn more about setting up index definitions on the Indexing page.
How do I use selectors for indexing content within the decorated DOM?
The indexing service captures the non-decorated DOM from the initial page load, before JavaScript executes. Content added dynamically won’t be indexed by default, but can be included by combining it with the indexing sheet via formulas or API calls depending on where the data needs to surface.
How do I prevent a page from being indexed?
To prevent individual pages from being indexed, add the noindex directive in the metadata block. To exclude larger site sections, configure exclusions in the bulk metadata sheet.
What strategies should I use to manage URLs and prevent SEO ranking loss?
Maintaining existing URL structure is the best way to prevent ranking loss. If simplifying or modernizing URLs during a site rebuild, use redirects to guide search engines and users to the new URLs. Temporary ranking fluctuations may occur until search engines reindex the updated content and recognize the new URLs as stable.
Does Edge Delivery Services support RSS feeds?
Edge Delivery Services does not have built-in RSS or Atom feed publishing. However, the Sidekick is extensible and it can be configured to generate Atom feeds for RSS readers from a page index.
Localization
What localization (l10n) capabilities does Edge Delivery Services support?
Edge Delivery Services supports localization by leveraging the built-in translation tools of your chosen content source. This allows customers to use familiar systems for content authoring and translation.
Learn more on the Translation and Localization page.
What are the best practices for handling localized or country-specific sites?
Organize content into different folders for each language version. Use translation tools integrated with your authoring environment. Create language-specific indices. Use placeholders for different languages.
Does Edge Delivery Services support HREFLang?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services supports HREFLang as part of sitemaps (sitemap.xml). It can be configured to reference different locales where needed.
Learn more on the Sitemaps: Multiple Sitemaps page.
Performance and Monitoring
What is Operational Telemetry?
Operational Telemetry is a service that measures how fast your site loads for actual visitors, what errors users experience, and where interactions are broken. Unlike lab-based tools like Lighthouse, Operational telemetry provides more accurate real-world performance data.
How do I enable Operational Telemetry on my site?
To enable operational telemetry, contact the AEM engineering team. They will open a pull request (PR) with the necessary JavaScript. All operational telemetry data is GDPR-compliant and does not collect personally identifiable information (PII).
Learn more on the Developing Real Use Monitoring page.
How can I track page KPIs such as completions, clicks, and impressions?
Edge Delivery Services supports tracking page KPIs through operational telemetry. Operational telemetry collection can be extended with custom checkpoints to track specific conversion events. Note that operational telemetry only samples visitor interactions and does not track individual users.
Learn more on the Developing Real Use Monitoring: Checkpoints page.
Authoring Content
What are the differences between different authoring modes, like Universal Editor and Document Authoring?
Fill out the Where To Author Your Site questionnaire and see which option fits your needs best.
Edge Delivery Services is agnostic to whichever authoring source you would like to use, but we recommend picking the right one for the actual authors who need to update content every day.
Where can I find the Edge Delivery Services URL of my document?
To find the URL of your document, open the Sidekick in your content editor and select “Preview”. This will take you to the preview URL of your page.
How do I edit pages?
Edge Delivery Services supports content editing in Microsoft Word and Excel, Google Docs and Sheets, AEM’s Universal Editor, as well as custom authoring environments.
Learn more on the Authoring Content page.
How do I publish a page?
To publish a page in Edge Delivery Services, open the Sidekick on the preview URL of your page and select “Publish”. This will make the page publicly available on your site.
Learn more on the Preview and Publish Content page.
Why are my changes in Microsoft Word not appearing on my site after previewing or publishing?
The SharePoint API can sometimes introduce a delay of up to three minutes before changes made in Microsoft Word become visible in Edge Delivery Services. To ensure changes appear immediately, manually save the document using CMD+S (Mac) or CTRL+S (Windows) before previewing and publishing.
You can also click on ‘Update’ in the Sidekick on the Preview page to get the latest saved content.
How do I unpublish a page?
To unpublish a page, first delete the corresponding source document. Then, open the Sidekick on the preview site. The “Unpublish” button will now appear, allowing you to remove the page from the public site while keeping it available in preview.
Learn more on the Authoring and Publishing Content page.
How do I delete a page?
To delete a page, first delete the corresponding source document. Then, open the Sidekick on the preview site. The “Delete” button will now appear, allowing you to remove the page from both the public site and the preview environment.
The “Unpublish” and “Delete” buttons only appear after the source document has been deleted, ensuring that pages are not removed accidentally.
Learn more on the Authoring and Publishing Content page.
Why does my new document return a “404 Not Found” error?
New documents do not automatically generate a preview URL. To create one, open the Sidekick in the editor and click “Preview”.
How do I schedule content publication in Edge Delivery Services?
Edge Delivery Services allows you to schedule API-driven publication using spreadsheets. For large-scale launches, such as a rebrand or product launch, best practices include using GitHub branches or forks and copies of large content folders to coordinate and time content changes effectively.
Learn more on the Scheduling page.
What if I have a big release of content that needs to be published at the same time?
Edge Delivery Services has APIs to support the concept of Snapshots that allow customers to Add/Remove individual pages to a collection called a “Snapshot Manifest”. The Snapshot can then be reviewed and approved/rejected. Publishing a Snapshot will take everything from the Snapshot Manifest and publish it at the same time immediately. You can use the Snapshot Admin tool to manage Snapshots.
What should I do if my content seems outdated?
First, ensure that any recent changes to the content have been saved in your authoring environment. Then, open the Sidekick and select “Preview” to refresh the preview of your page. You can also click on ‘Update’ on the Sidekick if you are in the Preview URL
How does Edge Delivery Services generate URLs? What characters are allowed?
Edge Delivery Services constructs page URLs based on document and folder names. To maintain clean and easy-to-type URLs, only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and dashes (-) are allowed. Unsupported characters are automatically transformed.
Learn more on the Document Naming page.
Does Edge Delivery Services have a WYSIWYG editor for in-browser editing?
Edge Delivery Services supports multiple authoring environments, including AEM Universal Editor, Adobe Document Authoring, and commonly used existing tools like Microsoft Word, Excel, Google Docs, and Google Sheets.
Does Edge Delivery Services support inline text styling within a paragraph?
Edge Delivery Services supports inline text styling with semantic formatting: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, subscript, superscript, and code. Colors and font settings (like font face and size) must be defined explicitly in CSS.
How do I set an image size?
Edge Delivery Services automatically optimizes image sizes, so authors do not need to manually set dimensions. Developers can use existing helper functions to get the appropriate size of the image they want to use.
How do I add alt text to images?
In Word, select the image, go to the “Picture” ribbon, and choose “Alt Text.” In Google Docs, right-click the image and select “Alt Text.”
Other authoring environments may have different interfaces for adding alt text. It’s important to ensure alt text is properly set wherever content is authored to improve accessibility and SEO of your page.
Can a metadata block be used as the first block in a document?
Yes, a metadata block can be placed anywhere in a document, including as the first block.
What is the metadata spreadsheet and how is it used?
The metadata spreadsheet is a centralized sheet for managing site-wide metadata for SEO. It allows you to set default metadata, exclude specific page sections from indexing, and more.
Learn more on the Bulk Metadata page.
How do I add name anchors to headlines in pages?
Edge Delivery Services automatically generates id attributes for all headings. For example, a heading titled “This is a Title” will be accessible via the URL fragment #this-is-a-title, eliminating the need to manually add anchors.
What do the three dashes (---) in a document do?
Three dashes indicate a section break. Sections can be useful in structuring pages, applying different background styles, or triggering animations.
Does Edge Delivery Services support videos as source content?
Yes, short videos can be uploaded to your authoring environment. After previewing and publishing the video with Sidekick, a URL will be generated that can be referenced in the source document.
Should animated GIFs or MP4 files be used for short video content?
MP4 is recommended for short videos and animations because it provides smaller file sizes, broader compatibility, and a more predictable authoring experience (while Google Docs displays animated GIFs inline, Microsoft Word only shows the first frame though the full animation is still hosted).
Can I use embeds or iframes?
Yes, the embed block supports embedding content from external sources, including iframes, such as YouTube videos.
How can I manage editable content templates?
Content templates can be managed using the templating mechanisms available in your chosen authoring environment. For example, Microsoft Word and Google Docs provide a broad range of built-in template functionality.
In any environment, you can create example documents (such as article pages, landing pages, or two-column layouts) that authors can duplicate and modify as needed.
How can I compare different versions of a page?
Version comparison is managed through the versioning features available in your chosen authoring environment. For example, Microsoft SharePoint and Word provide built-in version tracking and document comparison tools.
Many external tools, such as DiffSite, can also be used to compare differences between the preview and publish states of a page.
Does Edge Delivery Services offer content reporting or a search-and-replace feature?
Edge Delivery Services has APIs and tools like Image Audit or Page Status to help with common content reporting needs in addition to what the source content repositories provide.
While Search and Replace is easy to do in individual documents, to do it across multiple documents can be done using either the AEM Importer or other custom scripts using libraries to bulk update Word or Google documents.
How are internal and external links handled in Edge Delivery Services?
Internal links to .page and .live URLs are automatically converted into relative links to ensure proper navigation between pages. External links to third-party sites remain unchanged and function as standard external links.
How are links to documents (content source) handled?
By default, links to documents point to their original locations in the content source. If a document is published as a page on the site, its URL will match its folder structure from the source (unless a redirect is configured). For authors, it is often more intuitive to use absolute links copied and pasted from the browser.
Sidekick
What is the AEM Sidekick?
The AEM Sidekick is a browser extension that provides editing, previewing, and publishing capabilities for your Edge Delivery Services site. It can support multiple projects.
How do I install the Sidekick?
The Sidekick is available for Chrome-based browsers (including Microsoft Edge) from the Chrome web store.
What should I do if my Sidekick isn’t working?
If your Sidekick is not functioning, we recommend you reinstall the Sidekick for your project by visiting the AEM Sidekick Configurator.
With a Dynamic Media license, can authors select different asset variations in the Sidekick?
Currently, the Asset Selector Sidekick Plugin does not provide an option to pick a variation. If the customer has a Dynamic Media (DM) license with DM Open API access, they can configure the Asset Selector to copy the DM asset link as a reference. Authors can then modify the copied DM URL by appending query parameters to retrieve different asset variations.
Development and Deployment
How do I set up a local development environment?
To develop Edge Delivery Services pages locally, install Node.js and run npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli && aem up. This starts a local server that updates with code changes in real time and uses production content for accurate previews.
For a full guide to get started, visit the Developer Tutorial.
How do I create a testing or staging environment?
Edge Delivery Services is fully serverless, eliminating the need for dedicated environments. To try new functionality, simply create a branch in your GitHub repository.
Learn more on the Staging & Environments page.
How does Edge Delivery Services handle concurrent code editing by multiple developers?
As long as you are developing locally, your code remains on your machine and only content is shared. When you commit code to a GitHub repository, Git manages version control and merges changes from multiple developers.
Does Edge Delivery Services support private GitHub repositories?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services supports private GitHub repositories. As with public repositories, The AEM Code Sync bot needs to be installed on the repository.
Can Edge Delivery Services integrate with GitHub Enterprise?
Edge Delivery Services supports GitHub Enterprise Cloud but does not support GitHub Enterprise Server (because Edge Delivery Services requires access to a public GitHub API).
Does Edge Delivery Services support alternative Git repository hosts, like Bitbucket?
A GitHub repository is mandatory. However, since Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS), you can host your codebase on other platforms (like Bitbucket) and push branches to GitHub for deployment.Note: There is now the new BYOGIT feature as early access technology. It allows to directly use a bitbucket, gitlab and soon azure repos repository directly with EDS. see https://www.aem.live/developer/byo-git
What is fstab.yaml?
fstab.yaml is a configuration file that defines the content source for your site. It specifies a mountpoint using sharing URLs from your authoring environment, determining where Edge Delivery Services pulls content from. Its format is similar to an fstab file in UNIX.
With Helix 5, fstab.yaml is no longer required. Content sources can now be configured via the Configuration Service API, allowing the same code repository can be reused across multiple sites in a repoless fashion.
Does Edge Delivery Services support multiple content mountpoints in fstab.yaml?
No, each project can have only one content source in both fstab.yaml or the Configuration Service.
How does code move from .page to .live?
When code is pushed to any branch in GitHub, the AEM Code Sync app automatically syncs it to the Codebus, making it available on both .page and .live.
How is continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) configured?
Edge Delivery Services works in a scaled trunk-based development model. Since there is no build process required, it makes developer velocity much faster. Customers can add their internal processes via Github Actions and Workflows to also trigger other processes and build checks needed during Pull Requests.
How does Edge Delivery Services handle caching for head.html updates? Do I need to clear the cache manually?
When you update head.html, Edge Delivery Services automatically purges the cache for all HTML pages, ensuring that changes take effect immediately. Manual cache clearing is not required.
Do I need to protect against DOS attacks with a WAF on our CDN?
Edge Delivery Services origins are designed to withstand common internet attacks, including typical scripted and DOS attacks. The AEM security and operations team continuously implements countermeasures to mitigate risks. Because your CDN may also connect to other origins beyond Edge Delivery Services, you may still want to use WAF services to protect those additional origins.
Learn more on the Security page.
Should redirects be managed on the CDN, or does Edge Delivery Services handle them?
Edge Delivery Services supports redirect management through a “redirects” spreadsheet stored in the root folder of your project in your authoring environment. This allows for centralized control of URL redirects without requiring CDN-level configuration.
Why do content-based assets return a 301 redirect to a media_ image?
When an asset is previewed, it is uploaded to the media bus, which stores it immutably. To maintain a human-readable filename, the asset can still be addressed by its original name. During delivery, the request is redirected (via 301) to the immutable media bus URL for retrieval.
Can I configure redirects to return a 302 (temporarily moved) status code?
Edge Delivery Services only supports 301 (permanently moved) redirects through the redirects spreadsheet file to optimize caching. Other kinds of redirects must be configured at the CDN level.
What is the character limit for a branch/subdomain?
Edge Delivery Services subdomains follow the format branch--repo--owner. The combined length of the branch, repository, and owner name (including the two required separators [--]) cannot exceed 63 characters. This is a DNS limitation and is not specific to Edge Delivery Services.
For more details, see the DNS size limits section in RFC 1035.
What is the policy on using cookies or localStorage to store application state?
Edge Delivery Services does not process cookies on the server side. We recommend using URL parameters to store application state.
Content Blocks
Does Edge Delivery Services have something like components?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services uses “blocks” as our components. A block is a reusable section of a page. By default, Edge Delivery Services displays document content as-is, but blocks allow for specific functionality and styling.
How do I create a block?
To create a block, place your content inside a table with a header row containing the block name. Edge Delivery Services will recognize this structure and apply the corresponding functionality or styling.
Learn more on the Exploring Blocks: How They Work page.
Where can I find a list of available blocks?
Available blocks vary by project. Many projects maintain a block inventory (or “kitchen sink”) page that showcases the available blocks and their structure.
Edge Delivery Services boiler plate code includes a set of commonly used blocks. Apart from that there is Block Collection boilerplate that includes additional blocks .
Learn more about Block Collection
Does Edge Delivery Services support nested blocks?
No, Edge Delivery Services does not support nested blocks to keep authoring simple and manageable. However, nested structures can be achieved in other author-friendly ways. For example, nested fragments can be used for more complex layouts.
How can I implement a design system?
To implement a design system in Edge Delivery Services, leverage (or expand) the existing CSS variables for design tokens and ensure blocks are reusable across pages.
How can I reuse content across multiple pages in Edge Delivery Services, like AEM’s Content and Experience Fragments?
Edge Delivery Services supports centrally managed content reuse through the fragment block, which embeds content from one page into another. Edge Delivery Services loads headers and footers as fragments by default.
What is the equivalent of Core Components in Edge Delivery Services?
The Block Collection serves as the equivalent of Core Components in Edge Delivery Services. The collection provides a set of pre-built, extensible blocks designed for modern websites, providing an easily customizable foundation for any project.
How do blocks compare to Web Components?
Blocks are a core feature of Edge Delivery Services, integrating seamlessly with minimal setup. They are easy to author, optimized for performance, and are built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Web Components provide encapsulation and cross-platform reusability, making them valuable for design systems. However, they require careful lifecycle and performance management to avoid unnecessary overhead.
Frameworks and Web Technologies
Are Web Components recommended for Edge Delivery Services projects?
Web Components can be used in Edge Delivery Services projects, but they are not the default recommendation. While they offer modularity and reusability, they require careful optimization to avoid impacting performance.
Learn more on the Web Components page.
Can I integrate Web Components from a design system into Edge Delivery Services?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services supports integrating Web Components from design systems. Web Components should be initialized within blocks and only loaded when needed to avoid unnecessary overhead.
Can I use JavaScript frameworks?
Edge Delivery Services does not require a specific frontend framework, but supports integration with frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and Svelte. The recommended approach is to use technologies such as React Portals or Web Components within application-centric blocks while keeping simpler blocks in plain CSS and JavaScript for optimal web performance.
When loading external components that are render-critical for the largest contentful paint (LCP), make sure to load them from the same host as the main website, so you avoid the performance penalty of a second DNS lookup and TLS handshake. This can be accomplished by mapping the path in the CDN or pushing the required components into the site's git repository.
Can I use CSS frameworks?
Yes, CSS frameworks like Less, PostCSS, and TailwindCSS can be used in Edge Delivery Services. CSS frameworks should be used thoughtfully, balancing page speed with layout shifts while keeping styling readable and maintainable. Usually, using any framework also adds a build step that can slow down development velocity and is not as instantaneous anymore which is a big advantage of going without a framework.
Does Edge Delivery Services support server-side rendering (SSR) for Lit-based Web Components?
No, Edge Delivery Services does not support any server-side customizations. Instead, it generates optimized, semantic markup that can be decorated on the client side for styling, functionality, and personalization. This ensures flexibility while maintaining optimized performance.
Integrations and Third-Party Tools
What are the performance considerations when integrating with third-party tools?
Integrating third-party tools can impact performance, especially if they block rendering or delay LCP (Largest Contentful Paint). Avoid adding scripts in <head.html> to keep the critical rendering path clear. Instead, load scripts only when needed using loadScript() within specific blocks or IntersectionObserver to defer execution. Defer non-essential integrations and tools, such as analytics or tag managers, until after page load to reduce Total Blocking Time (TBT) and improve user experience.
Want to maintain high performance? Check out the Keeping It 100 guide.
Can I integrate with AEM Sites?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services can be seamlessly integrated. Edge Delivery Services is a part of AEM Sites!
Can I use Adobe Target?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services is compatible with Adobe Target. Learn more at the Configuring Adobe Target Integration page.
Additionally, Edge Delivery Services features a built-in experimentation framework that enables quick test creation, execution without performance impact, and fast deployment of test winners.
Can I use Adobe Analytics?
Yes, Adobe Analytics can be integrated with Edge Delivery Services just like on any other website.
Can I use Adobe Launch?
Yes, Adobe Launch can be integrated with Edge Delivery Services just like on any other website.
Can I use AEM Forms?
Yes, with a valid AEM Forms license, Edge Delivery Services supports AEM Forms through the Adaptive Forms Block, allowing you to create, style, and manage forms within your site.
Learn more on the Forms page.
Can I use Marketo forms?
Yes, Marketo forms can be embedded in Edge Delivery Services pages using the Marketo Forms API or iframe embed codes.
Is there a default forms capability that can send email on submission?
No, Edge Delivery Services does not include a default forms capability that sends emails on submission. However, you can integrate services like AEM Forms, Adobe Campaign, Workfront, or external email APIs to handle form submissions and email notifications.
Can I use AEM Assets?
Yes, AEM Assets can be used in Edge Delivery Services by configuring the AEM Assets Sidekick plugin. This allows authors to access and use AEM Assets within SharePoint or Google Docs.
Does Edge Delivery Services support Cloudflare?

Can I integrate with OneTrust for consent management?
Yes, OneTrust can be integrated with Edge Delivery Services just like on any other website.
Can I integrate translation tools?
Yes, third-party translation tools can be integrated into Edge Delivery Services. While Edge Delivery Services natively supports translation features within content sources, additional translation services can be incorporated at the content source or CDN tier for more advanced localization needs.
Can I integrate a third-party search solution?
Yes, integrating a third-party site search is common for large websites. The built-in sitemap feature is typically used to facilitate this integration. Edge Delivery Services includes out-of-the-box indexing, which provides a fast and simple search option for most websites.
Can I import content from other platforms to Edge Delivery Services?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services supports content migration from various platforms, including WordPress, Unsplash, Contentful, other AEM instances, and more. The AEM team will help you in the import process, ensuring your content from any CMS is converted.
How do I configure Edge Delivery Services with Dynamic Media and Smart Cropping?
Smart cropping can be configured within AEM Assets.
Legal and Compliance
What is the service level agreement (SLA) for Edge Delivery Services?

Picking the right CDN
A Content Delivery Network makes sure that your visitors get your site served as fast as possible when entering your domain name. Adobe Experience Manager integrates with many popular CDN choices, but if you are unsure which one to pick, answer the questions below
Questionnaire
Cloudflare (Enterprise)
AEM customers use Cloudflare Enterprise and benefit from fast and fine-granular purging, powerful extensibility with Cloudflare Workers, support for multiple backends, and zero-trust security support. It's also an all-around good CDN.
Learn how to set up Cloudflare for Adobe Experience Manager
Cloudflare (Free)
Cloudflare's free option is a great choice for smaller sites, as the free tier comes with included traffic and support for Cloudflare Workers. It does not support key-based purging, which means for some updates Adobe Experience Manager has to purge the entire site, making Cloudflare free unsuitable for large sites with frequent content updates.
Learn how to set up Cloudflare for Adobe Experience Manager
Cloudfront
Cloudfront is the CDN that is included in your Amazon Web Services contract. It is a passable CDN that is supported by Adobe Experience Manager, but many important features are missing such as support for fine-granular content purges. This makes Cloudfront unsuitable for sites with lots of content and a high frequency of updates.
If this does not discourage you, here is how to set up Cloudfront for Adobe Experience Manager
Fastly (self-managed)
If you are already a Fastly customer, then you know why Adobe Experience Manager integrates with it out of the box: a rock-solid and blazingly fast CDN with fine-grained push invalidation that you can configure using Fastly's VCL language.
Learn how to set up Fastly for Adobe Experience Manager
Fastly (managed by Adobe Experience Manager)
Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service bundles the Fastly CDN, which means it's included in your contract. Advanced configuration options require using configuration pipelines in Cloud Manager, so you combine the best of YAML with VCL.
Learn how to set up Adobe Managed CDN
Fastly (managed by Adobe Commerce)
As an Adobe Commerce customer, you have access to the bundled Fastly CDN. It's a great choice of CDN, rock-solid, blazingly fast, and, thanks to VCL, extremely configurable with plenty of public documentation.
Learn how to set up Fastly for Adobe Experience Manager
Akamai
Akamai is the market-leading CDN and if you are a customer, there is no reason not to use it with Adobe Experience Manager. Akamai supports push invalidation at reasonable speed and can combine sites with multiple backends, which helps when migrating a legacy site to fast edge delivery.
Set up Akamai for Adobe Experience Manager in 13 easy steps.

BYO CDN Setup
Customers may use their own CDN to deliver AEM content under their own domain (aka BYO Production CDN). While customers are generally free to configure their CDN according to their own needs there are some settings mandated/recommended by Adobe Experience Manager:
Origin urlhttps://main--<yoursite>--<yourorg>.aem.live
Headers sent to origin
X-Forwarded-Host: <production domain>
X-Push-Invalidation: enabled(see Configuring Push Invalidation)
X-Forwarded-Host: <production domain>
X-Push-Invalidation: enabled(see Configuring Push Invalidation)
Origin cache controlI.e. Cache TTL on the production CDN is controlled via origin cache control response headers. This should be enabled (if available).
Compression (gzip)Should be enabled
Query parameters
Must be forwarded to origin
Must be included in cache key
Must be forwarded to origin
Must be included in cache key
Age response headerThe Age response header must be either suppressed or overridden (Age: 0)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) CloudFront Setup
The following screenshots illustrate how to configure AWS CloudFront to deliver content from an AEM origin. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
Create a CloudFront distribution
Configure the origin
Use main--sitename--orgname.aem.live as the Origin domain.
Add following custom headers:
X-Forwarded-Host: your domain name
X-BYO-CDN-Type: cloudfront
If you have successfully configured push invalidation for your project you should also add the following custom header:
X-Push-Invalidation: enabled
Cache behavior
Keep the default settings here.
Cache key and origin requests
Click "create cache policy"
Create cache policy
Set the Default TTL to 300 seconds.
Under "cache key settings", keep the defaults:
Headers: none
Cookies: none
Compression support: gzip, brotli
And override the following:
Query Strings: Include the following query strings
width
height
format
optimize
limit
offset

Then click create and close the tab to return to the previous screen.
Apply Cache policy and origin request policy
After returning to the distribution properties, click the reload buttons next to the Cache policy and origin request policy dropdowns, so that the two newly-created policies show up. Next, select the new policies for both Cache policy and origin request policy.
Create distribution
Select whether you want to enable a Web Application Firewall (WAF). Your AEM origin requires no WAF and use of a WAF is neither required nor recommended for AEM origins.
Scroll to the end of the page and click "create distribution". We need to return to the configuration later, so remember the ID of your distribution.
Create Function to remove Age and X-Robots-Tag headers
In the Cloudfront sidebar, select "Functions" and click "Create function".
Enter a name for the function (e.g. stripHeaders), an optional description and click on “Create Function”:
Replace the code of the function with the following snippet and click on “Save changes”:
Select the "Publish" tab and click on “Publish function”:
Finally, associate the function with your distribution by scrolling down to "Associated distributions" and click "Add association".
In the following dialog, select:
Distribution: the ID of your new distribution
Event type: viewer response
Cache behavior: default
Finally, click "add association"
That’s all (more or less). Please test the distribution in a stage environment.
Optional: Authenticate Origin Requests
If you have enabled token-based Site Authentication, go back to Cloudfront → Distributions → <your distribution> → Origins → <your AEM origin> → Edit
Under "Add custom header", select "add header" and create a header Authorization with value token <your-auth-token>. Replace <your-auth-token> with the token value created through token-based Site Authentication (it starts with hlx_) as the header value.
This will ensure that all requests from the AWS Cloudfront CDN to your AEM origin use the correct authorization.
Set up push invalidation for AWS Cloudfront
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
NB: CloudFront does NOT support purging by cache tag/key. Purge by cache tag/key always triggers a purge all.Configuration properties:
To create the AWS credentials:
In the AWS Console, open the IAM dashboard, then select Policies → Create policy:
In the following screen, select "CloudFront" as a service, and "CreateInvalidation" as action, then click "Add ARNs" to restrict the permissions to a single distribution.
Enter you Distribution Id and click on “Add ARNs”:
Proceed to “Next: Tags” and then “Next: Review”.Enter a name for the new policy, e.g. “AEM<YourSite>Invalidate”, and click on “Create policy”:
In the IAM dashboard, select Users → Create user
Enter a user name (e.g. “Invalidator”) and click on Next:
On the “Set permissions” pane, select “Attach policies directly” and select the newly created policy (“AEM<YourSite>Invalidate” in our example):
Proceed to the next step, click on “Create user” end then “View user”:
Select the “Security credentials” tab and click on “Create access key”:
Select “Third-party service”, click the checkbox and proceed to “Next”:
Finally, copy the Access key ID and Secret access key values:
You can validate the credentials with this tool.

Configuring Site Authentication
AEM Live supports token-based authentication. Site authentication is usually applied to both the preview and publish sites, but can also be configured to only protect either site individually.
Warning
Enabling Site Authentication for the publish sites (*.aem.live) will enforce authentication for all your site visitors (intranet). It will also prevent automatic PSI (Page Speed Insights) checks from running on your pull requests in GitHub. For use cases where your BYO CDN should use no (or different) authentication from your .live origin, you will need to configure preview only authentication or bypass authentication with an API_KEY.
Limitations
Only authentication is supported. Authorization is not supported.
Authentication can only be enabled or disabled for the entire site
It is not possible to create a custom error page for denied access
Enable Authentication for the Preview and Publish Sites
Click here to view instructions on how to update the configuration in document mode
1. Enable the Configuration Service
All of the following instructions use the Configuration Service for your site, so follow the linked instructions to enable and authenticate, then perform the following API requests.
2. Create a site token to access your protected site
POST an empty body to http://admin.hlx.page/config/{org}/sites/{site}/secrets.json the response will be a JSON object containing an id and value field. Remember both, you'll need them for the next steps:
Note that you now have two tokens:
The auth token for the admin API obtained during login. This one is highly sensitive and cannot be used for site authentication.
The site token, which you just created, which can be shared with users and systems than need to access your site
3. Enable the token to access your site
POST to http://admin.hlx.page/config/{org}/sites/{site}/access/site.json so that accessing your site on aem.page and aem.live requires the token value you've retrieved in the previous step.
The response contains the content of the access.site object. Each POST request overwrites that object, so if you want to update any content, make sure to perform a GET request to the same URL before and include the original content.
The example above sets the site property which controls access to both aem.page and aem.live. This is the most restrictive approach. If you want to limit access to both aem.page and aem.live, POST to .../access/site.json. If you want to limit access to aem.page only, post to .../access/preview.json. In the unlikely case that you want to limit access to aem.live only, and keep aem.page, post to .../access/live.json.
If you have set tokens for site and either preview or live, then preview and live will override the site-wide settings.
4. Verify that access has been limited
When you open your site in your browser, you will see an HTTP 401 status code, indicating that no access is possible without authentication. Next, try to access the site and provide the token value:
In this request we use the site token value in the Authorization header.
5. Make your CDN pass the right Authorization header
With this change, nobody can access your site without the correct authorization header. This includes your CDN, and therefore every visitor to your site. To enable access again, you need to add the Authorization header to each origin request your CDN makes.
The CDN setup instructions explain how to enable the authorization header for each supported Content Delivery Network.
Browser Access to the Protected Sites
Accessing protected sites directly from a browser requires users to have an appropriate role defined in the project configuration and to sign in using the AEM Sidekick Extension.
Example
The following excerpt of the access object of a site configuration for acme/website enforces the following:
Protects *--website--acme.aem.page
Allows to access *--website--acme.aem.page with a site token that has the id SGFsbG8gVG9iaWFz
Does not protect *--website--acme.aem.live
Enforces authentication of the admin API for acme/website
Allows sidekick authenticated users that have a *@acme.com email to preview, publish, etc.
Allows performing admin API operations with an admin token with the JWT jti 1kLvEvoipnINAOGDP8NVl3IYbJy2qmUQa5b1Fe23S7tt depending on the included scopes.

Configuring Site Authentication
The following guide describes the deprecated IDP-based authentication for hlx.live. For AEM Live, use token-based authentication.
Configuring Site Authentication for hlx.live
AEM Live supports out-of-the-box authentication using the Microsoft Identity Provider (IDP) and Microsoft accounts. Your site acts as an application to which the administrator of your Microsoft organization will need to grant access. Site authentication is usually applied to the preview and publish sites, but can also be configured to only protect the sites individually.
Warning
Enabling Site Authentication for the publish sites (*.hlx.live) will enforce authentication for all your site visitors (intranet). It will also prevent automatic PSI (Page Speed Insights) checks from running on your pull requests in GitHub. For use cases where your BYO CDN should use no (or different) authentication from your .live origin, you will need to configure preview only authentication or bypass authentication with an API_KEY..
If you use authentication, your BYO (production) CDN must not use (disable) caching, otherwise authentication is gradually circumvented.
Limitations
Only authentication is supported. Authorization is not yet supported.
Authentication can only be enabled or disabled for the entire site
It is not possible to create a custom error page for denied access after login
Enable Authentication for the Preview and Publish Sites
In order to enable authentication, it is sufficient to add relevant access-statements to your site configuration. Upon encountering said access-statements, AEM will automatically configure your site to redirect to the Microsoft IDP for authentication.
Step 1: Create Configuration
If not present already, create your site configuration file:
In your site’s root folder create a folder named .helix
Go to the folder named .helix
Create a new spreadsheet with name:
On sharepoint: config.xlsx
On GDrive: config
On sharepoint: config.xlsx
On GDrive: config
Name the first column header key
Name the second column header value
Step 2: Add Access Allow To Configuration
Open your site configuration file, located in your site root folder: .helix/config.xslx (on Sharepoint) or .helix/config (on GDrive).
Add access.allow key/value pairs as rows to your configuration sheet for each individual user or wildcard-domain you’d like to give access to the site for.
Example for an individual user: access.allow = some.user@adobe.com
Example for a wildcard domain: access.allow = *@adobe.com
The following example would grant access to the site for all users within the “example.com” domain and the single user “some.user@adobe.com”:
Step 3: Activate Your Configuration
If you haven’t done so already, install the Sidekick Extension.
With the site configuration sheet still open, click the Sidekick’s “Preview Button”:
This will copy your site configuration to both the preview and live stages of AEM, since configuration values are treated global. Authentication, by virtue of the access.allow statements you added in the previous step, should now be automatically enabled on your site.
Go to your site’s preview URL (https://main–<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page) or live URL (https://main–<repo>--<owner>.hlx.live). You should be redirected to the Microsoft Sign In page:
Sign in with a user covered by the access.allow statements.
If this is the first time this AEM site is used in conjunction with a Microsoft Login for your account or domain, the IDP will ask to give permissions to the AEM Application. Depending on your setup, an administrator may need to grant those permissions. (see step 4: granting admin consent)
After login, you should be redirected to and see your site.
Incase you are not the admin on the account, you see the following message:
In this case, ask an Active Directory admin of your organization to login via the admin link: https://admin.hlx.page/auth/microsoft
They should see the following:
The admin can either grant consent directly by checking the ‘Consent on behalf of your organisation’ when they log in, or later via the Azure Portal.
Step 4: Granting Admin Consent via Azure Portal
In order to grant admin consent, open the azure portal and go to:Home -> Active Directory -> Enterprise Application s
Search for the Franklin Admin:
And click on Grant admin consent for {your organisation}.
After clicking Accept you can refresh the Permissions blade a few times, until the consented permissions show up:
Now, the non admin user should be able to login.
FAQ
Q: I have published the configuration limiting access to my site, but I can still see the index page without login, whereas sub-paths are protected.A: This is most likely a caching issue. You can resolve it by publishing the index document (e.g. index.docx) again.
Enable Authentication only for the Preview Site
It is possible to configure the access controls differently for the preview (*.hlx.page) and publish (*.hlx.live) sites by only applying the allow configuration property to one site. For example:
Or you could also grant different users access to the respective sites:
Accessing protected sites with an API_KEY
It is possible to obtain an API_KEY to access a protected site without the need to login.
The key needs to be passed to the protected site via the authorization header. For example
In order to let the system trust your key, its API_KEY_ID needs to be configured on the project as well through the access.apiKeyId property.:
Note: It is possible to configure more than one key, by just adding another row.
You can simply remove the apiKeyId again from the configuration if you no longer need or trust the respective APY_KEY.
Note: It is currently not possible to generate an api key self serviced. Please contact your Adobe Project Lead to generate one for your project if needed.
Limiting access to repositories
AEM allows development from forked repositories that point to the same content. This results in the ability to access the same content via different URLs. For example a site that has its primary repository at example/website can be accessed using https://main--website--example.hlx.page. Assuming a developer forks the repository to developer/ex-web, and keeping the same fstab.yaml, the same content can be accessed via https://main--ex-web--developer.hlx.page. This might be fine or even desirable during development. But once production content is published, it might be undesirable that the same content can be accessed using a different url (and potentially different website code).
In order to restrict which urls can be used to access the content, add a access.require.repository to your /.helix/config.xlsx. For example:
would only allow access via the https://main--website--example.hlx.page and https://main--website--example.hlx.live urls.

Setting up the configuration service
The Configuration Service is used to aggregate and deliver configuration for various consumers in the AEM architecture including: Client, Delivery, HTML Pipeline, and Admin Service.
Configurations stored in the client scope can be consumed from your site or the AEM Sidekick and control functionality and behavior for visitors and authors. All other configurations are internal to the AEM infrastructure and cannot be accessed directly.
The configuration is managed using REST calls to the Admin service (admin.hlx.page). See AEM Admin API for details of the API.
For existing AEM projects (coming from hlx.live) projects, the configuration service aggregates a valid configuration based on the various sources (fstab.yaml, .helix/config.xlsx, etc). This ensures backward compatibility, but means that some features are not available in this document mode (the traditional, distributed configuration).
One of the new features that the configuration service can support is independent code and content definitions per site. A site is a combination of an org name and a site name. This is similar to the GitHub owner and repo tuple, but has no longer a relation to the GitHub project.
For example, a site named website of the org acme could have a code repository adobe/helix-website. The preview URL follows the same scheme, but using site and org instead. In this example: https://main--website--acme.aem.page.
.
With this new mechanism, it is now possible to have multiple sites that use different content, but use the same code repository. This feature is also known as “repoless”.
Prerequisites
There are some rules and constraints when creating new setups that use the configuration service:
Any aem.live organization needs also to exist as github.com org, and at least one repository needs to be synced using AEM Code Sync. This ensures that the organization namespace is properly claimed by an entity that can also claim an org on github.com. The github.com org can exceptionally be created by Adobe or a trusted implementation partner on the customer’s behalf, but it must have at least one owner from the customer's organization.
For projects that want to use multiple sites with the same code repository (repoless), there must be one canonical site for which the org/site matches the github owner/repo. This is required for proper code-config association and CDN push invalidation.
Create your Organization
Once your first site is up and running, contact an Adobe representative to create the aem.live org for you and add the administrative user(s).
Add your Sites
In this example we will create two new sites, website and products of the acme org, which will both share the same github repository: acme/website. The content is managed in sharepoint, at a fictitious https://acme.sharepoint.com/sites/aem/Shared%20Documents/website and .../products.
We assume that the acme org is already set up and a user was defined that can manage the site configurations.
1. Create new configuration for the first site
Make sure that you are properly authenticated, then using the Admin API, we create the first site:
The new site is now available at https://main--website--acme.aem.page. Most likely only the 404.html is shown, as no content has been previewed yet.
2. Create new configuration for the second site
Using the Admin API, we create the second site:
The new site is now available at https://main--products--acme.aem.page. Most likely only the 404.html is shown, as no content has been previewed.
Updating a site's configuration
You can update the site configuration either as a whole document, or only certain sub-structures. Here are some examples:
Update Access Control
Use this to assign roles to your users. For example, to add user bob to the configuration admin role:
Update Code Location
Use this to switch your site to a different code base (see also repoless):
Update Production CDN
Use this to configure the CDN settings:
Update Headers
Use this to set custom HTTP headers:
Update Folders
Use this to update the folder mappings.
Update Public Custom Configuration
Use this to define public project configuration, for example for easy consumption on the client side:
Caution: Do not store any secrets in public configuration! It will be accessible to everyone at https://<your-host>/config.json.
Update Sidekick Configuration
Use this to customize the Sidekick:
Update sitemap.yaml
Update robots.txt
Use this to customize instructions for robots and crawlers:
Remove unused configuration files
Once you have enabled the configuration service, the configuration settings there override the settings you have in configuration files in your GitHub repository and your content source, so it is best to remove them:
First remove the files from github:
fstab.yaml
robots.txt
tools/sidekick/config.json
helix-query.yaml
helix-sitemap.yaml
And after those are removed, check if the hlx.page preview page returns a 404. This means that the internal configuration of the repository based config is cleaned up. Then you can also unpreview and delete the configuration in /.helix folder in your content:
.helix/config.xlsx
.helix/headers.xlsx

Repoless - One codebase, many sites
If you have many similar sites that mostly look and behave the same, but have different content, you may want to share code across multiple sites. In the past, the best way to do this was to create multiple GitHub repositories, keep them somehow in sync, and run each site off a dedicated GitHub repository.
AEM supports running multiple sites from the same codebase without having to take care of code replication. This ability is also known as "repoless", because all but your first site don't need a GitHub repository of their own.
Follow this document to learn how to create and manage multiple sites off the same codebase. Make sure you have followed the developer tutorial, as it provides the basics of creating a site on AEM.
How this works
Repoless sites are enabled by the Configuration Service in Adobe Experience Manager, which introduces a couple of concepts such as Organization, Profile, Repository, Site, and Content Source. The following diagram shows how the pieces fit together.
Organization
Each site in Adobe Experience Manager belongs to an organization. This organization has the same name as an org on github.com, so that there is no naming conflict. An organization can have multiple sites, profiles, and users.
Profile
Profiles are a way to group and re-use important configurations such as headers, indexes, additional metadata, and so on. A profile can be used by multiple sites within an organization, so that there is consistency among them.
GitHub Repository
For each codebase in Adobe Experience Manager, there is one GitHub repository. By creating a first site that uses this repository through AEM Code Sync, this code will be made available to Adobe Experience Manager and can then be used by multiple sites. When updates are pushed to the GitHub repository, they apply to all sites that use this codebase.
Site
A site combines content, code, and configuration to create a new web experience. Configuration can be attached directly to the site, or it can be referenced from a profile. While a profile can be used by multiple sites, each site can have only one profile. When there is a conflict between the configuration settings in a site and in a profile, the site configuration wins.
Which content source and which codebase to use for a site are configuration settings, too. This enables the re-use of code and repoless sites.
Content Source
The content that makes up a site is pulled from a content source when authors preview or publish content. Typical sources include Microsoft Sharepoint and Google Drive, or the bring-your-own-markup adapter.
Create your first base site
The first step to creating a bunch of sites is to create a first site. This site can be used to serve content, but the most important job is to ensure that code is synchronized from your GitHub repository to all sites that use this codebase.
Note: Make sure that you are properly authenticated for all the calls to Admin API
Pre-requisites
Github Repository : https://github.com/{org}/{site}
Content Repository (Gdrive / Sharepoint) : https://{org}.sharepoint.com/sites/aem/Shared%20Documents/{site}
Create organization
Contact Adobe to create the organization for you. Note: you will be asked to provide the URL to a github.com organization you own. Learn more.
Confirm the organization is created and you have administrator privileges.
Note : Please contact Adobe to obtain administrative privileges to create the organization config
Create site within organization
Using the Admin API, we create the first site
The new site is now available at https://main--{site}--{org}.aem.page. Most likely only the 404.html is shown, as no content has been previewed yet.
Create a repoless site
Pre-requisites
Base site configured with code and content repository using the Admin API (see previous section)
Content Repository (Gdrive / Sharepoint) for new repoless site : https://{org}.sharepoint.com/sites/aem/Shared%20Documents/{site2}
Create your first repoless site
Using the Admin API, we create new configuration for the first repoless site
The new site is now available at https://main--{site2}--{org}.aem.page. Most likely only the 404.html is shown, as no content has been previewed.
Now we have created multiple sites sharing the same code base but different content repositories.
Additionally, you can use the Admin API to set other available advanced options to use within configuration management.
To view your new site during local development, use the ––url option on the aem up command to specify the new site’s url, like aem up ––url https://main––{site2}--{org}.aem.page .
What’s not needed once you go repoless
When you start with Adobe Experience Manager, many settings are kept either with your content in the content source, or in the GitHub repository next to your code. With the Configuration Service there is now a central place for these kinds of settings.
Below gives you a comparison between how different areas are configured when we use the document mode (the traditional, distributed configuration) vs. using the Configuration Service API.

https://www.aem.live/developer/folder-mapping

Folder Mapping
It’s not uncommon for websites to serve multiple URLs from a single document, displaying dynamic content for large portions of the page without authors having to create each page individually.
Some best practices scenarios where folder mapping is useful:
Commerce websites generating product pages from a product information API
Blogs with dynamic listing pages of posts for categories or tags
For a single-page application, mapping requests to a code-bus resource
AEM handles these cases via a folder mapping in the fstab.yaml file:
If your site uses the configuration service, you can manage folders in your site configuration. See here for instructions on how to update folders.
Anti-Patterns
Folder mapping should not be used for:
Sites using a combination of a large number of folder-mapped pages and frequently changing metadata. For such use cases, it is better to provide the content via different methods. Talk to your Adobe contact to learn more.
Mapping of excessively dynamic or infinite URLs like /search/<query>, dynamic search results are better served via query parameters or URL hash property
Generating non-cacheable content like user specific URLs. This can lead to cache pollution and possible security risks if content is unintentionally cached.
Folder-mapped Metadata
If the site has folder mapping configured, the metadata files within that folder will apply to all pages for that mapping. For example, if /templates/ is folder-mapped to /templates/default, metadata in /templates/default/metadata.xlsx will be applied to all pages below /templates/ if the URL pattern matches.
Last-Modified Date
Changes to folder-mapped metadata are not reflected in the last-modified HTTP response header of pages within the mapped scope. By default, the date of the last modification of the default document will be used. If you rely on that header value to be updated based on metadata changes, which may be desirable for SEO or SEM purposes, you can influence* it by adding an explicit last-modified column. This allows you to set the desired date string or timestamp for select rows only while leaving the others unchanged. We recommend the ISO date format to ensure it’s both human-readable and timezone-safe. .
Example:
* Note: The actual last-modified HTTP response header is calculated based on the modification times of the contributing resources to the response:
The source document itself (for folder-mapped pages, this is the default document)
The head.html
The global (and additional) metadata
The custom headers configuration
The most recent modification time of those resources will be used. This means that the last-modified value provided might not be the final header value if, for example, the head.html is younger.
Additional Considerations
There are some additional rules applied to bulk metadata for folder mapped pages, see Folder-mapped metadata in the bulk metadata documentation for details.

HTML Markup reference
While for most development tasks the DOM is the relevant interface for a developer, there are certain situations (eg. Auto Blocking) where a developer interacts with the raw HTML markup that is rendered by the Franklin pipeline on the server.
General HTML Markup Document structure
Metadata
The metadata portion of the document consists of a list of <meta> tags, some of them correspond to well known HTML metadata or metadata data without defined semantics. See more in the metadata block specification.
In the simplest case there is a eg.<meta name="template" content="docs">
which maps a metadata property named template to a value of docs.
head.html
The head.html portion of the document contains verbatim of what’s found in the head.html of the corresponding github branch.
Main Content
All the content that semantically maps to document semantics of an individual page or fragment is found in the main-content content section of the markup. It consists of default content, sections and blocks.
It is important that both default content and any cell of a block can contain the following HTML tags and attributes.
While most of those are self explanatory and align very much with their respective semantic definitions there are a couple that are worth calling out.
<h1> to <h6>
Headings 1 through 6 have an id= attribute containing a sanitized version of the .innerText to allow for direct addressing of a heading in a URL fragment
<picture>, <source> and <img>
Images are rendered as a <picture>, <source> and <img> combination, with a mobile and desktop breakpoint, as well as a fallback for browsers that don’t support webp.
The <img> element features a height= and width= attribute containing the intrinsic dimensions of the image as well as an alt= attribute with the alt text as provided.
<span>
The use of <span> is limited to icons, and indicates the icon as part of the class="icon icon-<iconname>" attribute
<a>
There is special handling for links to AEM preview and live domains (hlx.page, hlx.live, aem.page, aem.live). Any link to one of these domains is rendered as a relative link. This allows authors to link to any of these domain from content pages and still work across preview, live, and production domains.

Metadata Block
Notes:
The Metadata table is handled by the pipeline service to add <meta> tags in the <head> of the HTML markup delivered from the service. It does not appear verbatim in the HTML markup. There should only be one Metadata table per page and while its placement doesn’t matter, by convention it is placed at the bottom of the document.
The metadata table is essentially following an intuitive name/value pair structure where the name is in the first column of the table and the value is in the second column.
There are a few special properties that behave according to the HTML specification and popular additional metadata schemas like og: and twitter:. The well known metadata properties include title, description, and image. See special metadata properties for the full list.
There are also special semantics for theme and template which get added as classes to the <body> element by the boilerplate code and are often used for styling and autoblocking.
Beyond that, a project can add an arbitrary number of name value pairs that get added as <meta> tags to the markup, and can be used with project specific semantics.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
See Content in Document
Code:
The metadata table is processed as part of the HTML rendering service. There is no project code related to the processing.

Footer (Block)
Notes:
The footer block is loaded by default in the boilerplate project into the <footer> element.Out-of-the-box it provides a simple example for a footer but is likely to be extended or adjusted on the per project basis.
The footer block is usually not referenced by authors but is loaded automatically on every page.
The content for the footer is loaded as a fragment and is by default authored in a footer (or footer.docx) document.As footer structure and designs change rarely and are usually visually very different from the rest of the blocks on a site, it is often a good strategy to divide the content into sections and decorate specific classes onto the sections based on their sequence and apply CSS styling to those classes.
The footer document has its own lifecycle and when previewed or published applies to all pages that use a given navigation.
It is not uncommon to have multiple footer documents for a site eg. one per locale / language.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:

Header (Block)
Notes:
The header block is loaded by default in the boilerplate project into the <header> element.Out-of-the-box it provides code for a responsive navigation but it is like most blocks very likely to be extended or adjusted on the per project basis.
The header block is usually not referenced by authors but is loaded automatically on every page.
The content for the navigation is loaded as a fragment and is by default authored in a nav (or nav.docx) document, and structured primarily into three sections for branding, navigation sections (nested <ul>) and tools.
The nav document has its own lifecycle and when previewed or published applies to all pages that use a given navigation.
It is not uncommon to have multiple nav documents for a site eg. one per locale / language or section of a site.

Section Metadata
Notes:
The Section Metadata table is handled by boilerplate code internally to add data-*s attributes to the containing section.
Section Metadata table follows an intuitive name/value pair structure where the name is in the first column of the table and the value is in the second column.
The Style property is translated into a class while any other name will be transformed into a data-* attribute.
As Section Metadata generally adds complexity for authors, it is recommended to avoid it, until it is really necessary.

Configuring Authentication for Authors
Enable Authentication for Authors
By default, authors don’t need to be logged in in order to use AEM via Sidekick. In order to enable authentication, it is sufficient to add relevant access-statements to your site configuration. Upon encountering said access-statements, the Sidekick will enforce authentication with the respective provider: Microsoft for Sharepoint based projects, and Google for Google Drive based projects.
Step 1: Add Access Allow To Configuration
Use the configuration service to update the access/admin section of your site configuration.
Add admin/role/author and or admin/role/publish array properties for each individual user or wildcard-domain you’d like to give access to the site for.
Example for an individual user: admin/role/publish: [ "some.user@example.com" ]Example for a wildcard domain: admin/role/author: [ "*@example.com" ]
The following example would grant author access all users within the “example.com” domain and publish rights to a the single user “some.user@example.com”:
Ensure that the users are able to authenticate themselves using their login credentials as follows:
If using Google Drive, they must be able to authenticate with their credentials using Google authentication.
If using Microsoft SharePoint, they must be able to authenticate with their credentials using Microsoft authentication.
Step 2: Login via Sidekick
The next time the Sidekick opens on a document, it will show a "Sign In" option:
Once you click it, it will open a new browser tab, redirecting to your respective provider:
The first time, it will ask for consent that the Admin service can access your Sharepoint or Google data. In case you are not an admin on the account, you will see the following message:
In this case, ask an Active Directory admin of your organization to login via Sidekick or directly via the admin link: https://admin.hlx.page/auth/microsoft
The admin can either grant consent directly by checking the ‘Consent on behalf of your organization’ when they log in, or later via the Azure Portal.
Now, the non admin user should be able to login:
Step 2 (Alternative) Granting Admin Consent via Azure Portal
In order to grant admin consent, open the Azure portal and go to:Home → Active Directory → Enterprise Application s
(Note that the application is only visible, if an admin has logged in in the steps above)
Search for the AEM Content Integration Admin API:
It should have the application id shown above.
Select the Permissions tab (below security):
And click on
.
After clicking Accept you can refresh the
blade a few times, until the consented permissions show up:
Using the Admin Service (admin.hlx.page)
When authentication is enabled for admin.hlx.page using the API endpoint with tools like curl will require to use a proper auth token. For one time ad-hoc use by developers it is very convenient to just copy/paste the x-auth-token header from your browser's network tab from an authenticated request sent by sidekick to admin.hlx.page and pass it into the curl via the -H option. eg:
Define user roles without enforcing authentication
By default, as soon as the role mapping is defined via an admin/role/* entry, authentication is enforced on that project. It might be desirable to allow unauthenticated access but still be able to define a user mapping, for example give a user the admin role.
The requireAuth property can be used for this with the following values:
auto is the default and enforces authentication as soon as a role mapping is defined.
true will always enforce authentication
false will not enforce authentication
Example:
Give the user bob@example.com the admin role but don’t enforce authentication:
Default Roles
If no role mapping is configured, the admin uses default roles to determine the permissions of the request. The default role can be specified using the admin/defaultRole property.
By default there are no default roles, unless requireAuth is auto, in this case the default role is basic_publish (see below). Example:
Use publish as default role:
Evaluation
The effective roles of a request are evaluated as follows:
If a request isn’t authenticated and requireAuth is true, a 401 status code is returned.
If a request isn’t authenticated and requireAuth is auto and role mapping is defined, a 401 status code is returned.
If a request isn’t authenticated the defaultRole is used.
If a request is authenticated and no role mapping is defined, or if requireAuth is false, the defaultRole is used.
If a request is authenticated and role mapping is defined and requireAuth is not false, the roles that match the user are used.
If no mapping matches, the user will have no role; effectively always returning a 403 status code.
If several mapping matches, the user will have a combined set of roles
If no mapping matches, the user will have no role; effectively always returning a 403 status code.
If several mapping matches, the user will have a combined set of roles

Further Reading
If you have set up the Configuration Service for your site, then you can use the following API operations to configure permissions for authors:
Create Site Configuration (applies to a single site)
Update Site Configuration (applies to a single site)
Create Profile Configuration (applies to multiple sites)
Update Profile Configuration (applies to multiple sites)
In each of these API requests, you will use the fields
groups (with the GroupsConfig schema) to define groups and assign group members
access.admin (with the AdminAccessConfig schema) to assign access permissions to groups or users

Extending the Sidekick
The goal of this document is to explain how developers can interact with the sidekick, and how it can be customized at a project level.
Events
The sidekick emits the following events:
(object) An object with the following properties:
(string) sourceUrl: The source URL
(string) targetUrl: The target URL
(object) An object with the following properties:
(object) config: The sidekick configuration
(object) location: The location object
(object) status: The status object
An event’s payload can be found in the event.detail property.
Listening for Events
In your project code (e.g. in /scripts/scripts.js), you can react to sidekick events as follows (replace foo with the name of the event you want to listen for):
Customizing the Sidekick
You can customize the sidekick for your project. You can add a /tools/sidekick/config.json configuration file to your project's GitHub repository or use the configuration service.
For all available configuration options, see the config schema. Here are some basics to get you started:
Host Settings
Note: The following host properties are optional in the sidekick configuration and should only be used to explicitly override the CDN settings in your site configuration:
host (string) The host name of the production website (overrides cdn.prod.host)
previewHost (string) The host name of the preview environment (overrides cdn.preview.host, defaults to *.aem.page)
liveHost (string) The host name of the live environment (overrides cdn.live.host, defaults to *.aem.live)
reviewHost (string) The host name of the review environment (overrides cdn.review.host, defaults to *.aem.reviews)
Plugins
Plugins allow you to add custom functionality to the sidekick, enhancing your users’ experience.
Common Plugin Properties
The following properties are applicable to all plugin types:
id (string) is mandatory and must be unique within a sidekick configuration.
title (string) will be shown on the plugin button.
titleI18n (object<string, string>) defines optionally translated titles.
pinned (boolean) determines if the plugin is pinned to the toolbar (default) or folded into the … menu.
environments (string[]) specifies where the plugin should appear (dev, edit, admin, preview, live, or prod).
exclude_paths (string[]) defines patterns to exclude the plugin based on the path in the current tab’s URL.
include_paths (string[]) defines patterns to include the plugin based on the path in the current tab’s URL.
URL-based Plugins
You can specify a url that will be opened in a new tab when the plugin button is clicked:
The following properties are specific to URL-based plugins:
passConfig (boolean) pass the project configuration via query parameters
passReferrer (boolean) pass the originating URL via query parameters
Event-based Plugins
Alternatively, you can specify the name of an event to be fired when the plugin button is clicked. This allows the execution of custom JavaScript code in the context of your page by listening for the event on the sidekick element. Custom events will have a custom: prefix. For your convenience, the custom event dispatched contains a copy of the current sidekick state.
Note: Event-based plugins can only be used in the following environments: Development, Preview, Live and Production. Executing custom code is not possible in Edit or Admin.
In your project code (e.g. in /scripts/scripts.js), you can react to the event as follows:
Special Plugin Types
Palette Plugins
Palettes are variants of URL-based plugins which load the configured URL inside a floating palette instead of opening a new tab.
isPalette (boolean) opens the target of a URL-based plugin in a palette instead of a new tab.
paletteRect (string) optionally defines the size and position of the palette in the format of a DOMRect.
The following example creates a standard palette placed at the bottom left of the window:
If you wish to change the size and positioning of your palette, use paletteRect:
Popover Plugins
Popovers are variants of URL-based plugins which load the configured URL inside a popover instead of opening a new tab. Popovers are centered above the plugin's button.
isPopover (boolean) opens the target of a URL-based plugin in a popover instead of a new tab.
popoverRect (string) optionally defines the width and height of the popover in the format of a DOMRect.
If you wish to change the width or height of your palette, use popoverRect:
A theme query parameter is appended to the URL to style the iframe in line with the current sidekick theme. If no background color is set on the content’s body, it will inherit the popover’s translucent background.
Container Plugins
Containers allow you grouping plugins together and help save space in the toolbar. Clicking a container plugin simply toggles its dropdown, it can’t have its own URL or event action.
isContainer (boolean) renders a plugin as a dropdown instead of a button.
containerId (string) adds a plugin to a container plugin with the specified ID.
The following example creates a container named “Tools” and places a plugin “Foo” in it:
Badge Plugins
Badges allow you to add labels to the sidekick under certain conditions. They will be rendered on the right hand side of the toolbar. Badges have a merley decorative purpose and can’t be clicked.
isBadge (boolean) renders a plugin as a badge instead of a button.
badgeVariant (string) optionally determines the badge’s color scheme (gray, red, orange, yellow, chartreuse, celery, green, seafoam, cyan, blue, indigo, purple, fuchsia, or magenta)
The following example adds a “Stage” badge to the sidekick in the preview environment:
Custom Edit URLs
If your project does not use SharePoint or Google Drive as content source, you can tell the sidekick how to link to your custom editing environment when the user clicks Edit.
The following two config options are available:
editUrlLabel (string) set the label visible to the user
editUrlPattern (string) defines an URL pattern for the custom editing environment. Supports placeholders like {{contentSourceUrl}} or {{pathname}}.
Special Views
You can specify a special view for the sidekick to redirect to when the current tab’s URL matches a certain pattern. This can help you provide a seamless user experience across different media types, and also enables the execution of custom code (event-based plugins). The original resource URL will be available in a url query parameter.
The properties path and viewer are mandatory. Optionally, you can specify a title that will be shown at the top, and you can provide localized titles in a titleI18n object:
At the path specified by viewer, add an HTML file to your GitHub repository, for example:
Add an optional CSS file in the same directory, and a JS file with your custom logic, for example:
Development Workflow
The following workflows are designed for detached sidekick development to prevent unintentional disruptions for the authors on your production site:
Using a Site Copy
If your site’s configuration is stored in the Configuration Service, you can use temporary site copies for sidekick development:
Create a copy of your site in the Configuration Service. For example, if the name of your original site is site1, you could create a site1-dev, reusing the same code and content.
Open the preview URL for site1-dev in your browser: https://main--site1-dev--org.aem.page.
Make your desired changes to the sidekick object in the site1-dev configuration.
Refresh the browser tab after each change to test your changes.
When done, copy the sidekick object from site1-dev to the site1 configuration to roll your changes out to all authors.
Note: When using the sidekick in an editor environment (Google Drive or Microsoft Sharepoint), it will load the config from the original site by default. If you want the sidekick to let you choose which configuration to load, first add the new site to your sidekick from the preview or live URL. Now the sidekick will display a picker with all matching sites.
Using a Repository Branch
If your site’s configuration is not stored in the Configuration Service, you can use a branch in GitHub for sidekick development:
On your site’s GitHub repository, create a branch from main. For this example, we’ll use dev as the branch name.
Open the preview URL for the dev branch in your browser: https://dev--site1--org.aem.page.
Open or create the following file in your repository: /tools/sidekick/config.json.
Make your desired changes to the sidekick configuration file and push changes to the dev branch.
Refresh the browser tab after each change to test your changes.
When done, create a pull request and merge the changes to the main branch of your repository.
Caution: Never commit directly to the main branch in your original repository. Always create a branch and ask for a review of your changes via pull request before merging into main.
Note: When using the sidekick in an editor environment (Google Drive or Microsoft Sharepoint), it will load the config from the original site by default. If you want the sidekick to let you choose which configuration to load, first add the new site to your sidekick from the preview or live URL. Now the sidekick will display a picker with all matching sites.

Document-based Project Configuration
This document explains how to set up a simple document-based project configuration. Note that for certain use cases, such as repoless sites or overlay content sources, you will need to use the configuration service instead.
The project configuration file is located in /.helix/config.xlsx (for sharepoint) or /.helix/config (for google drive). It consists of a table using Key and value columns. For example:
The format of the keys follows the identifier-dot notation, like in javascript. You can think of the sheets as a flattened JSON structure. If a key appears more than once, it would form an array, eg:
Will conceptually be a structure like:
The following table lists the configuration options of a project.
Also see the JSON Schema and Typescript Types of this config.
Note: Activate the configuration using the Sidekick for your configuration changes to become active.

Adobe Managed CDN
The following steps illustrate how to use the Adobe Managed CDN (part of Edge Delivery Services entitlement) to configure a property to deliver content from a site powered by Edge Delivery Services in Adobe Experience Manager Sites as a Cloud Service.
Prerequisites and limitations
You must have a license with an Edge Delivery Services entitlement.
You must own the domain under which you want to serve your site.
You need to be able to make Domain Name System (DNS) changes to the domain name.
You have the choice to bring your own certificate or ask Adobe to provide one provisioned by Let’s Encrypt.
HTTPS is required and IPv6 is not supported.
Before you go live
There are two deployment options for going live with Adobe Managed CDN
Setup an HTTP proxy from an existing AEM Sites as a Cloud Service environment. This is typically used when you already have an existing environment and you want to migrate part of a site to Edge Delivery Services. You can also add a new environment.
Setup a new Edge Delivery site independently of an AEM Sites as a Cloud Service environment. This is the approach used when you do not have an AEM author or publish environment and you want to use Edge Delivery Services on its own. See here for benefits.
A checklist of the steps you need to do for both options:
Install or request a certificate in Cloud Manager (you need to do that for both www and non-www apex domains)
Install the domains Cloud Manager (you need to do that for both www and apex domains)
Add a CDN configuration to map your domain to your Edge Delivery site. (This will be done differently depending on what deployment option you chose)
Setup push invalidation in the project's configuration
Point the DNS CNAME of your www site to cdn.adobeaemcloud.com and the A records of your apex to the IP addresses listed below.
(Option 1) Setup a proxy from an existing environment
This requires an existing AEM Sites as a Cloud Service environment that needs to be configured via configuration pipeline to proxy some (or all) paths on your domain to your Edge Delivery Site. (see how to define a proxy using originSelectors and how to run a Configuration Pipeline).
A redirect from https://example.com to https://www.example.com must be defined using a redirect rule, but all other redirects may use the redirects spreadsheet
(Option 2) Setup an Edge Delivery site without an existing environment
In case you do not have an existing authoring/publish environment, follow the steps for setting up a new Edge Delivery site in Cloud Manager.
An automatic redirect will be established from https://example.com to https://www.example.com but all other redirects must happen through the redirects spreadsheet
Setup push invalidation
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the managed CDN whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by URL and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration. Depending on how you author your content, this is done in two different ways:
If you author your content with Sharepoint or Google Docs, create an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive.
If you author your content with AEM Authoring and the Universal Editor, create a spreadsheet called configuration in the Sites console.
If your site is using the configuration service, see here how to update the CDN configuration.
In the spreadsheet, define the following configuration properties:
After making changes to the configuration sheet, preview it with the Sidekick or publish it in the Sites console to activate the changes.
(Optional) Lower the TTL of existing DNS records before going live to enable a faster rollout
If the DNS records for your go-live domain have a long time-to-live (TTL)—such as 12 hours or more—you may want to temporarily lower the TTL (for example, to 1 hour or even 60 seconds) to speed up site rollout. Doing so ensures traffic is routed to the new site more quickly after launch. Be sure to restore the original TTL value when updating the DNS records for go-live.
As you go live
Make or request following DNS change:
For www.example.com set the CNAME DNS record to cdn.adobeaemcloud.com (see details).
Use a high time-to-live (TTL) value of 3600 seconds (one hour) or more to improve site reliability during a DNS outage. If you previously lowered the TTL for a faster go-live rollout, make sure to restore it to its original longer value.
If you want to establish an automatic redirect from https://example.com to https://www.example.com, the following additional steps are required
For example.com set the A record to these four IP addresses: 151.101.3.10, 151.101.67.10, 151.101.131.10, and 151.101.195.10 (see details)
If your DNS provider cannot support multiple IP addresses in an A record (for example, GoDaddy), use any of the listed IP addresses. This will be a bit less reliable.
Use the same high TTL as described above
Depending on your DNS setup—including the TTL specified in your DNS records—changes can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours to propagate. If your site already receives traffic, ensure all redirects are configured or keep the existing site live until the TTL expires and all traffic is routed to the new site.
If you are hosting both the apex and www versions of the domain, make sure DNS is properly configured for both to enable certificate generation.
For a timed launch, consider setting up a temporary holding homepage that you can quickly replace with the final content at the launch time. Because publishing in AEM is fast and reliable, this approach gives you better control over when your content becomes publicly visible than relying solely on DNS changes.
After you go live
The AEM team reviews your setup and notifies you if any issues are found.

Upgrading to aem.live from hlx.live
As outlined on our deprecations and end-of-service page, the hlx.live domain will shut down December 18 2025. Fewer than two percent of daily traffic still flows through hlx.live, and the last dozen sites are already in active migration.
The AEM team has already reached out to you and is ready to guide your move. If your production site still points to hlx.live, migrate immediately to aem.live or risk an abrupt blackout when hlx.live retires.
If you are familiar with *.hlx.live for published content and *.hlx.page for previews, please note that we are introducing *.aem.live and *.aem.page as new domains for your sites.
With this change, we are also introducing several improvements while making sure everything works just as before. The most important benefit is that preview URLs will load faster on aem.page thanks to caching.
In this guide, we will walk you through the changes you'll need to make to upgrade to aem.live. Many of these steps are only required if you use specific features, so you may not need to complete all steps. Rest assured, the process is straightforward, and we are here to help you every step of the way.
Try your site on aem.live
Go to your site on hlx.live and replace hlx.live in the URL with aem.live. For instance, if you used to see your site on https://main--helix-website--adobe.hlx.live/ then your new URL would be https://main--helix-website--adobe.aem.live/. No more hlx.live, instead it's aem.live now.
Try previews on aem.page
If your site works on aem.live, then previews will also work on aem.page. For instance, if you used to see your site on https://main--helix-website--adobe.hlx.page/ then your new URL would be https://main--helix-website--adobe.aem.page/.
Tell Sidekick to use aem.live and aem.page
Even though both hlx.page and aem.page work for previews now, Sidekick will always default to hlx.page.
Let's change this. In your Sharepoint or Google Drive folder, locate the .helix/config spreadsheet and add following values, replacing <owner with your GitHub organization and <repo> with your repository name:
cdn.live.host: main--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live
cdn.preview.host: main--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page
Preview the spreadsheet using Sidekick to activate the new configuration.After activating the configuration, please make sure the Sidekick preview action is opening urls with .aem.page.
Point your CDN to aem.live
In your CDN setup, change the origin URL or host name from hlx.live to aem.live and activate the change. If you experience any issues, then revert the origin URL or host name back to hlx.live and contact Adobe for assistance.
We recommend to make the change in a lower environment such as stage before performing it in production environment
That's it, you made it! Your site is now on aem.live. For 95% of all sites, this is all you have to do. Keep reading for the remaining 5% of special cases.
If you need help during the upgrade or ran into issues, please join our Discord channel or get in touch with us to discuss further.
Advanced Upgrade Scenarios
If you are using BYO DNS without BYO CDN
If you use custom domains without a custom CDN, please contact Adobe to perform the origin change to aem.live.
If you are using hlx.page or hlx.live urls in your code
Check your GitHub repository for any references to hlx.page or hlx.live. If you find them, double-check the functionality, as the changed hostname may introduce CORS or other cross-origin issues. Update the references to aem.page or aem.live.
Code references to hlx.page and hlx.live in the sampleRUM() function, lib-franklin.js or aem.js do not need to be changed.
If you are using hlx.page or hlx.live in your content
Check your content repository for any instances where you might have references for hlx.page or hlx.live in any content areas, including spreadsheets, for project-specific functionality.
Update link references around project documentation areas that may include, but not limited to, Block Library, Runbooks, Authoring Guides, and Pull Request Templates.
We don't need to update in-content or absolute links/hrefs pointing to hlx.page or hlx.live in the Word documents, as they will be auto-transformed to aem.page and aem.live.
If you use the deprecated forms endpoint to receive form posts in Excel or Google Sheets
The forms service on hlx.live has been deprecated and will not be supported on aem.live. Please contact Adobe to discuss possible alternatives for this service.
If you have configured external services to use hlx.page or hlx.live
Many services like Google reCaptcha, Google Maps, Cloudflare Turnstile, etc. use the site domain or referrer domain to validate API tokens. If you have configured these services to allow your site on hlx.page or hlx.live, make sure to also allow aem.page and aem.live
If you want to update aem.js, too
Upgrading to aem.live does not require code changes. Some teams use the opportunity to also update to the latest version of aem.js. It's best to treat this as a separate upgrade and (like all code changes) test it on a separate branch.

Deprecations and End-of-Service
Features in AEM that are not used anymore, or have been replaced with better solutions will be removed. Before these features are removed, they are declared deprecated and we provide suggestions for possible replacements.
In the next step, Adobe posts an end-of-service date on this page. After the end-of-service date, the respective service or feature will no longer be available.
*.hlx.live and *.hlx.page
The *.hlx.live and *.hlx.page domains are deprecated as of August 23rd, 2024 and will be replaced with *.aem.live and *.aem.page. Instructions for upgrades to aem.live and aem.page are available.
After February 14 2025, newly created sites will only be available on aem.page and aem.live.
After December 18 2025, hlx.page and hlx.live will no longer be available. We encourage you to upgrade before that.
Feature Deprecations
Custom domains without a custom CDN
Deprecation notice
We no longer accept new domains for the Bring-your-own-DNS service. Please use Adobe Managed CDN.
Cloudflare Setup (config only, no worker) for hlx.live
Deprecation notice
This setup has been deprecated, we recommend to use the cloudflare worker setup instead.
Manual Forms Sheet Setup
Deprecation notice
This feature is deprecated and has been replaced by Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms.
Configuring Site Authentication
Deprecation notice
IDP-based site authentication will no longer be supported on aem.page and aem.live. It will still be possible to enable token-based authentication, with self-service generation of site tokens using the config service.
Folder Mapping
Deprecation notice
Please contact us if you have a use case for folder mapping. We will help to find the best solutions. Existing projects using folder mapping may need to migrate to a different solution in the future.
AEM Sidekick v6
Deprecation notice
This version of the sidekick has been deprecated. Use the latest sidekick version instead.
Scheduling

A high-five for aem.live
If you've been using Adobe Experience Manager for a short while, you may have wondered what the hlx.live and hlx.page in the preview and live URLs of your site mean. If you have been using AEM for a longer while, you may have wondered when *.hlx.live would follow the steps of aem up, www.aem.live, and AEM Sidekick.
Today is the day we make the switch. I'm happy to announce that hlx.live is now aem.live and this transition brings several new changes that will improve your experience:
New Domains: your site is now available under *.aem.live and previews are on *.aem.page
Improved Performance: Previews on *.aem.page are a bit faster than on *.hlx.page, thanks to better caching
More and better stuff: aem.live enables advanced features such as centralized configurations, repoless sites, and more secure authentication
Starting today, all new projects created from the tutorial, will use the new aem.live architecture. Existing projects can upgrade following these steps.
AEM Live has been in development for nearly a year and in production for over six months. With more than 25% of our traffic now handled by aem.live, it’s proven itself ready for your site’s upgrade and your site will be in good company.
Speaking of good company, Joe Doherty, director of web development at The Channel Company shared this anecdote with us: "We've been running on aem.live since we heard about it on the AEM Discord channel a few months ago. When the business asked us to spin up an entirely new regional site with an unheard-of deadline of just four weeks, other teams would have balked at the challenge. With aem.live and repoless sites, we were able to meet that demand and help our business grow."
Edge Delivery Services for Adobe Experience Manager Sites as a Cloud Service started more than five years ago with Project Helix, and the acronym hlx could be found by our early adopters all over the place: in domains, user names, command line tools, and so on. With aem.live as the default, the name Helix is back to being an internal designator of the architecture version and the hlx.live and hlx.page domain names will see an eventual end of service.
Ready to make the switch? Upgrade your existing projects to aem.live today and start enjoying faster performance, advanced features, and a seamless AEM experience. For detailed instructions on how to upgrade, visit our upgrade guide or reach out to our team for assistance.

What is Adobe Experience Manager?
Create a website,seriously fast.
Adobe Experience Manager now integrates the tech you already own, know, and love. Your content, your tech, your audience taken to the next level.
We didn't find a good match. Visit our documentation page for more.
Use the technology you already have
No time for slow sites
Faster sites, better business
You don’t have the time for slow sites – and neither do your visitors.
Business OwnersSlow sites are not just a bad experience, they are also bad business. Why spend to acquire traffic only to lose the engagement on the site? Improved performance improves business outcomes like conversions, time on site, and order values.
VisitorsPerformance is the number one factor limiting user experience of sites on the web. Performance outranks all other factors including design and content. Slow sites cause users to bounce, leave, and never return.
SEOSlow sites mean most of your audience won’t even see your site. With site performance becoming the most important factor for search engine rankings, this means lost traffic that you need to buy back in ads.
DevelopersMany developers are stuck getting their sites to acceptable performance standards, and great performance seems out of reach. Adobe Experience Manager takes a performance-first approach to delivery, making lighthouse score 100 a reality.
Publish Faster
A CMS that gets out of the way gets your content on the way
Business OwnersBy using the tools your authors already know, you don’t just cut down on time for training and onboarding, you also manage your content in one place. When dealing with structured content, Adobe Experience Manager plays nice with Excel and Google Sheets.
AuthorsAEM takes the unstructured content that you already have, in Word or Google Docs, and turns it into active web experiences. You can use the tools you already know, and all it takes to publish is the press of a button.
DesignersThe content-first approach of AEM turns rigid content modeling chores on its head: the CMS adapts to the content authors create, instead of forcing authors to think in components, structure, and rules of a CMS.
Content OperationsBuilt with the needs of real-world mission-critical sites, AEM cracks the nuts of managing metadata at scale, delivering internationalized and localized content, optimizing for search engines, social sharing, testing, and experimentation.
Develop Faster
Everything modern web development needs, and not a single bit more
Business OwnersWith its lightweight approach to web development, Adobe Experience Manager allows you to go live in weeks, onboard new developers in days, and iterate on changes in minutes. Unlimited preview sites give you confidence that changes will be what you need.
OperationsAEM is one less thing to be on call for. Incredible availability due to fully redundant architecture, endless scalability as a full software as a service and easy integrations with your existing CDN make go-live anxiety a thing of the past.
DevelopersAEM uses all the things modern web developers love: GitHub, local development with auto-reload, performance, simplicity – and none of the complications: no transpilation, no bundlers, no configurations, no overhead.
Quality EngineersAutomated assurance of performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices thanks to built-in quality checks. Continuous assurance of real-world site performance and functionality through real user monitoring.
Benefits
Made to meet your every CMS need and more
Unmatched Speed
The full Adobe Experience Manager stack is optimized for one thing: make your content shine, and make it fast. Delivering at speed is not enough, so we also make it fast to author, publish, and develop.
Content At Scale
From simple sites to ten thousands of pages, AEM handles content at scale, across markets, languages, and countries. And even the biggest sites publish instantly with pushed cache purges.
Uncertainty Eliminated
There’s no place for guesswork in authoring high-performing sites. Each preview generated by AEM offers 100% fidelity, and a unique, easily shareable URL for your reviewers.
Widen the Talent Pool
Using what you already know, is the core of the AEM approach. This means your team can do more with less, requires less training and creates fewer support tickets.
Low Code Productivity
Building great sites does not require complicated frameworks, tooling, or processes. AEM uses plain HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create exceptional experiences without the usual overhead.
Composability is Here
Headless or headful, your content can go farther with AEM’s composable architecture. Deliver the right content in the right format, and add the right decorations to make it an experience that stands out in any channel.
Content First
No matter if structured or unstructured, AEM puts your content first, delivers it optimally and provides your developers with everything they need to make it shine.
Peak Performance
Every great experience starts and ends with performance. Adobe continuously monitors the performance of your AEM site and lets you know when there are ways to improve. All you have to do is approve the pull request.

Using AEM Sidekick
AEM Sidekick provides content authors with a toolbar offering context-aware options so that you can edit, preview, and publish your content directly from the pages of your website.
Installation
The Sidekick is available for Chrome-based browsers (that includes Microsoft Edge). You can install it from the Chrome web store.
Microsoft Edge Installation
To install the Sidekick extension into your Microsoft Edge Browser, you need to enable the following option to "Allow extensions from other stores" under edge://extensions in your URL bar.
Once that setting is enabled the sidekick can be installed from the Chrome web store.
First use of the Sidekick
Once installed, the Sidekick appears as a toolbar hovering over the bottom portion of your content in the browser. If it is not showing, click the Sidekick icon in the browser toolbar. The Sidekick provides you with various tools and actions for navigating and publishing your content.
If your site has authentication for authors enabled, you will first need to click Sign in to authenticate before you can use the Sidekick.
Signing in is not required to use the Sidekick to switch between environments and preview or publish content. However if you wish to unpublish and delete pages, you must sign in.
Using the Sidekick
The Sidekick can be invoked in the following contexts:
Within project environments
A preview URL (the domain name ending in .aem.page)
A live URL (the domain name ending in .aem.live)
A production URL (the domain name being your project’s public host name), custom preview URL, or custom live URL
Note: This requires adding the project to your configuration
A preview URL (the domain name ending in .aem.page)
A live URL (the domain name ending in .aem.live)
A production URL (the domain name being your project’s public host name), custom preview URL, or custom live URL
Note: This requires adding the project to your configuration
Note: This requires adding the project to your configuration
Within online editors (depending on your project setup)
Google Docs/Sheets
Microsoft Word/Excel
Google Docs/Sheets
Microsoft Word/Excel
The Sidekick extension can be toggled by clicking the Adobe Experience Cloud icon next to the address bar in your browser.
Source mode
When using document-based authoring to create content, content moves from the editor through different environments. The environment switcher allows you to easily jump between them.
When editing your document and first using the Sidekick, you default to Source mode. Click the Source button to reveal the additional environments available.
The environment switcher on a Sidekick in Google Docs.
In Source mode, you have the following action available.
Preview (re)generates the preview page based on the current document and opens it in a separate tab.
Preview mode
The preview environment reflects the latest changes of the page rendered from the source document. Preview environments are indicated by a blue label. You can send preview URLs to stakeholders so they can review your content before it gets published. Note that this option is only enabled if the content you are looking at has been previewed before.
The preview URL follows the pattern https://branch--site--org.aem.page/path.
branch, site and org identify the content source and code base to use
/path corresponds to the location of the content in Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint, starting from the root folder.
A / at the end of a path refers to the index document in a folder.
In Preview mode, the following actions are available:
Edit is used to open the content source for editing.
Update is used to force a content refresh.
For example if you have Source and Preview open in side-by-side tabs while working on the content.
The effect is identical to the Preview action in the editor.
For example if you have Source and Preview open in side-by-side tabs while working on the content.
The effect is identical to the Preview action in the editor.
Publish makes the current preview version of the page available in the live and production environments.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
If you are previewing a sheet, note that there are additional options available.
Previewing Sheets
Preview mode for sheets works the same as other pages, however there are additional options available that make managing changes to sheets easier for the author. When previewing a page, the preview loads the sheet using the Adobe Experience Manager Sites Data Rendition tool, to show the resulting JSON in a user-friendly way.
Tap or click the X in the banner to close the Data Rendition tool and view the raw JSON.
The preview lazy loads the first 1000 rows. You can search the entirety of the spreadsheet using the Search field.
To visualize what has changed since the last publication, tap or click Show changes.
This creates a diff, showing what has changed in your sheet between the current published state of the sheet and the content you are previewing.
Added lines are in green, prefixed with a plus.
Removed lines are in red, prefixed with a minus.
To show all rows along with the changes, tap or click Show all rows.
Live mode
Live mode is only available if there is no production environment yet. It shows the published content and serves as a stand-in for your project’s production environment. Live environments are indicated by a green label. Note that this option is only enabled if the content you are looking at has been published before.
The live URL looks almost identical to the preview URL, the only difference being in the 1st level domain: https://main--site--org.aem.live/path
In Live mode, the following actions are available:
Edit is used to open the content source for editing.
Publish makes the current preview version of the page available in the live and production environments.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Production mode
Production mode takes you to the production environment, which is your project’s public-facing website. Production environments are indicated by a green label.
This option may not be available during the development stage of your project or because no production environment has been configured yet.
This environment can be a 3rd-party or “bring your own” CDN.
If your public-facing domain name is yourproject.com, the production URL would be https://yourproject.com/path
The following action is available in Production mode:
Publish makes the current preview version of the page available in the live and production environments.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Source
If you are using the Sidekick in the preview, live, or production environments, the source switcher will also offer an Open in option, which opens the online editor of the current page’s source (either a document or the AEM editor) in a separate window.
At a minimum read access to the document in Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint is required to use this action.
Bulk Actions
Open the Sidekick in Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint and select one or more files to bulk preview and publish files and conveniently copy their URLs. The Sidekick counts the number of selected files and prompts you to confirm any bulk actions.
The Sidekick provides a status of ongoing bulk actions.
When the bulk actions are completed successfully, the Sidekick turns green and allows you to copy the URLs of the affected files via the Copy x URLs button or preview them via the Open x URLs button.
If a bulk action fails, it turns red and provides feedback on the failure via the Details button.
You can also use the bulk action feature to preview and publish media files. Adobe continues to extend the support for file formats that can be published directly from your content source (Microsoft SharePoint or Google Drive) based on popular use and security considerations. Currently the supported formats are MP4, PDF, SVG, JPG, PNG. You can learn more about file size limits here.
Limitation: in Microsoft SharePoint, large selections of more than 60 files may not be available to the Sidekick and may therefore need to be split into smaller badges.
Bulk Preview
Selecting multiple documents in Microsoft SharePoint or GDrive allows you to preview multiple documents en masse.
Bulk Publish
Selecting multiple documents in Microsoft SharePoint or GDrive allows you to publish multiple documents en masse. The Sidekick prompts you to confirm before performing bulk actions.
Copy URLs
Use this feature to copy the preview, live or production URLs of one or multiple files.
Unpublishing and Deleting Content
If you no longer require content to be published, you can unpublish it and/or delete it.
Unpublishing content will remove the page from your live and production environments, but still keep it in the preview environment for reference or future republication.
Deleting permanently removes the content from all environments, implicitly unpublishing it.
Unpublishing and deleting content require you to be signed into the Sidekick. You must also have the appropriate roles assigned to your user.
To unpublish you must have the role publish.
To delete you must have either the role publish or author.
Because unpublishing and deleting are not as common as previewing and publishing content, these options are kept behind an ellipsis menu, shown only when appropriate. Navigate to a published page or its preview and click the ellipsis button on the Sidekick to show the Unpublish option.
You can only delete pages from the preview environment. Deletion implicitly unpublishes the page if it has been published before.
Caution: The Delete and Unpublish actions cannot be undone! Double-check the URL and page content to make sure it is really OK to delete and/or unpublish a page.
Due to the finality of deleting pages, you must confirm your deleting by entering DELETE in a dialog.
Adding your project
The Sidekick is able to auto-detect if a URL belongs to your project. If you want the Sidekick to also recognize custom domains, such as your project’s production domain, custom preview domain, or custom live domain, you must add the project to the Sidekick.
This can be done in two ways:
From your source documents
Navigate to any source document associated with your project. Then click the context (≡) menu on the Sidekick and select Add this project.
From your project URL
Navigate to a project URL (similar to https://main--repo--owner.aem.page/) and click the context (≡) menu on the Sidekick and select Add this project.
Removing projects and migration
You can remove projects from the Sidekick by following the same steps, but select Remove this project from the context menu instead.
If you have used a previous version of the Sidekick, you can migrate your previously-configured projects.
Enable both the previous version of the Sidekick and the new version in your browser.
Right-click the Sidekick plugin icon in your browser’s menu bar.
Select Import projects from AEM Sidekick v6 from the context menu.
Managing Projects (Experimental)
Once you have added at least one project to your sidekick, you Then click the context (≡) menu on the Sidekick and select Manage projects to open the Project Admin.
The Project Admin page lists all projects you added to the sidekick.
Each project is listed with:
Convenient links to project resources including
Content location
Preview URL
Production URL (if configured)
Content location
Preview URL

Why I don’t recommend UI testing in AEM (even though I write tests for my own projects)
When customers or partners ask me, “Should we write UI tests for our AEM projects?”, I usually say, “No, probably not.” But here’s the twist: when I’m working on something like Optel Explorer or AEM Sidekick, I write extensive tests.
Sounds contradictory, right?
It’s not. It’s all about understanding the cost-benefit trade-off of testing and most importantly, knowing why we test in the first place.
Let’s start with the basics: Why do we test?
Testing isn’t glamorous but it’s the quiet force behind fast releases, fewer bugs, and happier users. We don’t test just to tick a box; we test to gain confidence. Confidence that our code works, that we can ship faster and that users won’t hit broken experiences in production.
But testing comes at a cost: time, complexity, maintenance, and infrastructure. So the real question becomes: Is the benefit of testing worth the cost in this context?
Think of testing like insurance. You don’t insure everything—you insure what’s valuable and vulnerable. Similarly, in software, we should test where the impact of failure is high and the cost of testing is low.
Let’s bring this to life with two contrasting examples.
Scenario 1: Backend Utility Library
Imagine you're building a backend library that’s used across multiple services. If something breaks here, the consequences are serious. A single bug could ripple across dozens of features. Fortunately, testing this kind of logic is straightforward. It can be done in isolation, without any UI, using fast and reliable unit tests. Since the logic doesn’t change often, the tests remain stable and require minimal upkeep.
In this case, the value of testing is high, and the cost is low. It’s a no-brainer; definitely worth the effort.
Scenario 2: UI Testing in AEM
Now picture writing UI tests for a visual component in AEM. A misaligned button or a slightly off layout might be annoying, but it rarely breaks the user experience. Setting up automated UI tests, however, is anything but simple. Frameworks like Playwright or Web Test Runner require significant setup, and the tests themselves are fragile - small, unrelated changes can cause them to fail. Maintaining them becomes a chore.
Here, the value is low, and the cost is high. In most cases, it’s just not worth it.
Why Any CMS Makes UI Testing Even Harder
Content Management Systems (CMSs) are designed for flexibility, not predictability and that’s exactly what makes UI testing in these environments so challenging.
Components are rendered dynamically based on authored content, which can vary wildly. Different authors structure pages differently, introducing inconsistencies that automated tests struggle with. What works locally might fail in CI/CD due to rendering differences or timing issues.

Getting Started – Developer Tutorial
This tutorial will get you up-and-running with a new Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) project. In ten to twenty minutes, you will have created your own site and be able to create, preview, and publish your own content, styling, and add new blocks.
Prerequisites:
You have a GitHub account, and understand Git basics.
You have a Google account.
You understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You have Node/npm installed for local development.
This tutorial uses macOS, Chrome, and Visual Studio Code as the development environment and the screenshots and instructions reflect that setup. You can use a different operating system, browser, and code editor, but the UI you see and steps you must take may vary accordingly.
To get you to a live website as fast as possible, this tutorial uses Google Drive as the content source. Edge Delivery Services supports multiple content sources including Google Drive, Microsoft Sharepoint, Document Authoring, and AEM Universal Editor.
Get started with the boilerplate repository template
The fastest and easiest way to get started following AEM best practices is to create your repository using the Boilerplate GitHub repository as a template.https://github.com/adobe/aem-boilerplate
Click the Use this template button and select Create a new repository, and select the user org that owns the repository
We recommend that the repository is set to public.
The only remaining step in GitHub is to install the AEM Code Sync GitHub App on your repository by visiting this link: https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync/installations/new
In the Repository access settings of the AEM Code Sync App, make sure you select Only select Repositories (not All Repositories). Then select your newly created repository, and click Save.
Note: If you are using Github Enterprise with IP filtering, you can add the following IP to the allow list: 3.227.118.73
Congratulations! You have a new website running on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/ In the example above that’s https://main--mysite--aemtutorial.aem.page/
Link your own content source using Google Drive
In your fork of the Boilerplate GitHub repository, the site points to an existing content source in Google Drive. See this folder for some example content.
This content is read-only, but it can be copied into your Google Drive folder to serve as a starting point.
To author your own content, create a folder in your own Google Drive and share the folder with the Adobe Experience Manager user (helix@adobe.com).
A good way to start authoring your own content is to copy index, nav and footer from the sample content and familiarize yourself with the content structure. nav and footer are not changed frequently in a project and have a special structure. Most of the files in a project look more similar to index.
Open the files and copy/paste the entire content into corresponding files in your own Google Drive. You can also download the files via Download All or download individual files. However, remember to convert the downloaded .docx files back into native Google Docs, when you upload them to your folder in your Google Drive.
Now that you have your content, you need to connect that content to your GitHub repo. You do this by changing the reference in fstab.yaml in your GitHub repo to the folder you just shared.Copy/paste the folder URL from your Google Drive to fstab.yaml.
Be aware that after you make that change, you will see 404 not found errors as your content has not been previewed yet. Please refer to the next section to see how to start authoring and previewing your content. If you copied over index, nav and footer all three of those are separate documents with their own preview and publish cycles, so make sure you preview (and publish) all of them if needed.
Commit your changes and you have hooked up your own content source to your website.
Preview and publish your content
After completing the last step, your new content source is not empty, but no content has been promoted to the preview or live stages, which means your website serves 404s.To preview content, an author has to install the Sidekick Chrome extension. Find the Chrome extension in the Chrome Web Store.
After adding the extension to Chrome, don’t forget to pin it, this will make it easier to find it.
To set up the Chrome extension, go to your previously shared Google Drive folder and click the extension icon in the browser toolbar and select Add this project.
As soon as the extension is installed and your project is added, you are ready to preview and publish your content from your Google Drive.Select all three docs and activate the AEM Sidekick by clicking on your pinned extension. A new toolbar will appear. Clicking the preview or publish buttons will trigger the corresponding operation.
Open the index doc and make some changes. Activate the Sidekick by clicking on your pinned extension and then click the Preview button which will trigger the preview operation and open a new tab with the preview rendition of the content.
Start developing styling and functionality
To get started with development, it is easiest to install the AEM Command Line Interface (CLI) and clone your repo locally through using the following.
From there change into your project folder and start your local development environment using the following.
This opens http://localhost:3000/ and you are ready to make changes.A good place to start is in the blocks folder which is where most of the styling and code lives for a project. Simply make a change in a .css or .js and you should see the changes in your browser immediately.
Once you are are ready to push your changes, simply use Git to add, commit, and push and your code to your preview (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/) and production (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live/) sites.
That’s it, you made it! Congrats, your first site is up and running. If you need help in the tutorial, please join our Discord channel or get in touch with us.

What is Adobe Experience Manager?
Create a website,seriously fast.
Adobe Experience Manager now integrates the tech you already own, know, and love. Your content, your tech, your audience taken to the next level.
We didn't find a good match. Visit our documentation page for more.
Use the technology you already have
No time for slow sites
Faster sites, better business
You don’t have the time for slow sites – and neither do your visitors.
Business OwnersSlow sites are not just a bad experience, they are also bad business. Why spend to acquire traffic only to lose the engagement on the site? Improved performance improves business outcomes like conversions, time on site, and order values.
VisitorsPerformance is the number one factor limiting user experience of sites on the web. Performance outranks all other factors including design and content. Slow sites cause users to bounce, leave, and never return.
SEOSlow sites mean most of your audience won’t even see your site. With site performance becoming the most important factor for search engine rankings, this means lost traffic that you need to buy back in ads.
DevelopersMany developers are stuck getting their sites to acceptable performance standards, and great performance seems out of reach. Adobe Experience Manager takes a performance-first approach to delivery, making lighthouse score 100 a reality.
Publish Faster
A CMS that gets out of the way gets your content on the way
Business OwnersBy using the tools your authors already know, you don’t just cut down on time for training and onboarding, you also manage your content in one place. When dealing with structured content, Adobe Experience Manager plays nice with Excel and Google Sheets.
AuthorsAEM takes the unstructured content that you already have, in Word or Google Docs, and turns it into active web experiences. You can use the tools you already know, and all it takes to publish is the press of a button.
DesignersThe content-first approach of AEM turns rigid content modeling chores on its head: the CMS adapts to the content authors create, instead of forcing authors to think in components, structure, and rules of a CMS.
Content OperationsBuilt with the needs of real-world mission-critical sites, AEM cracks the nuts of managing metadata at scale, delivering internationalized and localized content, optimizing for search engines, social sharing, testing, and experimentation.
Develop Faster
Everything modern web development needs, and not a single bit more
Business OwnersWith its lightweight approach to web development, Adobe Experience Manager allows you to go live in weeks, onboard new developers in days, and iterate on changes in minutes. Unlimited preview sites give you confidence that changes will be what you need.
OperationsAEM is one less thing to be on call for. Incredible availability due to fully redundant architecture, endless scalability as a full software as a service and easy integrations with your existing CDN make go-live anxiety a thing of the past.
DevelopersAEM uses all the things modern web developers love: GitHub, local development with auto-reload, performance, simplicity – and none of the complications: no transpilation, no bundlers, no configurations, no overhead.
Quality EngineersAutomated assurance of performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices thanks to built-in quality checks. Continuous assurance of real-world site performance and functionality through real user monitoring.

Frequently Asked Questions
General Questions
Why was this site renamed from Helix to Franklin to Edge Delivery Services?
Franklin and Helix were internal project names for the Adobe Experience Manager engineering team’s initiative to develop an innovative publishing and delivery service situated at the edge. Between 2022 and 2023, Adobe worked with select clients to test these capabilities, focusing on integrating diverse content sources and delivering web experiences that surpass the performance of a significant majority.
In October 2023, Adobe officially introduced Edge Delivery Services and document-based authoring as part of Adobe Experience Manager, marking the transition from the Franklin and Helix project names to a fully integrated solution.
What makes Edge Delivery Services websites so fast?
Edge Delivery Services optimizes web performance through a combination of caching and real-time content rendering at the edge. To maintain high speed, it continuously monitors site performance using strictly necessary operational telemetry and enforces automated performance checks via Google PageSpeed Insights on every code update (pull request).
Want to keep your site fast? Check out the Keeping It 100 guide.
Is Edge Delivery Services a Static Site Generator (SSG)?
No, Edge Delivery Services is not a Static Site Generator. Unlike traditional SSGs that require a full rebuild to update content, Edge Delivery Services dynamically renders and serves content at the edge, enabling instant updates without the need for a time-consuming build process.
Is Edge Delivery Services a Headless CMS, like AEM?
Edge Delivery Services is not a Headless CMS but rather the “head,” leveraging a CMS or document-based authoring as the content source.
While Edge Delivery Services primarily delivers fast-loading HTML experiences, it can also provide structured content in JSON format for applications that require it. Content authored in Edge Delivery Services can be aggregated into indices and delivered as JSON, making it compatible with headless implementations.
What is a good Lighthouse score?
Every Edge Delivery Services site can and should achieve a Lighthouse score of 100. AEM’s strictly necessary operational telemetry provides insights into actual site performance over time, allowing you to assess whether your site continues to meet that score.
Want to keep your Lighthouse score at 100? Check out the Keeping It 100 guide.
What is the difference between aem.page and aem.live?
aem.page provides an up-to-date preview of unpublished content. aem.live serves published content and is used as the origin for your production CDN.
Previously, these domains were known as hlx.page and hlx.live.
Take a look at our architecture diagram for more information on how content gets published.
Which browsers are supported?
Edge Delivery Services supports all modern browsers, including Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge. Internet Explorer (IE) is not supported.
How much does Edge Delivery Services cost?
Your Adobe account team can provide licensing estimates based on your target site’s needs and traffic expectations, as well as information on available trial license opportunities.
Get started for free by following the Getting Started: Developer Tutorial.
Does Edge Delivery Services require an Enterprise license?
Edge Delivery Services is part of AEM Sites and requires an AEM Sites license. Development access to the service does not require a separate license and is available for free.
Can I run Edge Delivery Services without full AEM Sites?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services can run independently without requiring an AEM Sites author or publish instance. If you want to use AEM authoring, an AEM Sites author instance is required.
How can we communicate with the AEM engineering team?
The AEM team is available for support and collaboration through both Slack and Microsoft Teams.
Where can I learn more?
Connect with the AEM Community on Discord or join an Adobe User Group to learn and build connections with fellow practitioners. For more information, visit our homepage at aem.live or the Experience Manager documentation.
Use Cases
Is Edge Delivery Services better for large or small sites?
Edge Delivery Services is a great solution for both small and large sites. Small sites benefit from its ease of setup, while large sites can take advantage of its ability to support many authors, frequent updates, and high traffic.
How big are the biggest Edge Delivery Services sites?
The biggest sites have over 100k pages and hundreds of authors.
Is Edge Delivery Services a good solution for landing pages?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services is well-suited for landing pages. Adobe uses pages.adobe.com to manage hundreds of landing pages, each owned and maintained by independent teams.
Is Edge Delivery Services a good fit for sites with dozens or hundreds of local markets, languages, or sub-brands?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services is a great solution for global enterprises managing multiple markets, languages, and sub-brands. It supports centralized content management and inheritance, enabling global updates while allowing local teams to make adjustments. Content rollout and localization can be integrated with existing translation memory systems in content sources like SharePoint and Google Drive.
Learn more on the Translation and Localization page.
Is Edge Delivery Services a suitable platform for small e-commerce websites?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services can be used for e-commerce websites. It supports integration with payment services like Stripe and Square.
Can Edge Delivery Services generate content for external platforms like GitBook?
Yes, but Edge Delivery Services no longer natively supports Markdown documents in GitHub as a content source. To publish content from GitHub, Markdown documents must first be copied to a supported authoring environment where they can be previewed and published.
Does Edge Delivery Services support content approval workflows?
Edge Delivery Services does not provide built-in content approval workflows, but instead delegates workflow management to the content source.
For document review and approval processes within SharePoint or Google Drive, we recommend Adobe Workfront.
Site Configuration and Management
How can I manage multiple subdomains?
Edge Delivery Services allows customers to use their own CDN to deliver content under their own domains or subdomains (BYO Production CDN).
Sites can be created with different code repositories or via repoless and point the site configuration to different CDN endpoints for Push Invalidation.
Learn more on the BYO CDN Setup page.
How does Edge Delivery Services handle inheritance and rollouts across multiple sites?
Edge Delivery Services has a broad range of facilities for centralized content and code management, allowing updates to be shared across multiple sites while still allowing for localized adjustments. AEM Universal Editor or Document Authoring have out of the box solutions for existing inheritance and content rollouts.
Can Edge Delivery Services be used along other CMS platforms on the same site?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services can be used alongside other CMS platforms when managed at the CDN tier. Many large, mature sites combine content from multiple origins, allowing different sections to be powered by separate AEM projects or external CMS solutions.
It helps to have top-level paths (sections of a site) be delivered from the same CMS so that CDN configurations will be easier to manage as opposed to a random list of URLs with no common parent in the URL.
Can Edge Delivery Services support secure content access for intranets, portals, or closed user groups?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services can support secure content access for intranets, portals, and closed user groups. Customer-specific authentication and authorization are typically enforced at the CDN tier, where all CDN vendors offer a broad set of integrations with existing identity providers.
In Edge Delivery Services, access to .page and .live origins can be restricted (independently), ensuring that content is only accessible through the CDN with the necessary authentication in place.
Learn more on the Configuring Site Authentication page.
How does Edge Delivery Services handle access control and multi-tenant authoring?
Edge Delivery Services follows the access control model of its connected content source. For example, SharePoint and Google Drive provide robust enterprise-level permissions that users and system administrators are already familiar with. For partial page access control, fragments are recommended to isolate content with different access control into separate documents. Separate teams can control their own content within their assigned folders, ensuring isolated workflows.
Access to specific blocks can be restricted (via the content library) and blocks can also be configured to prevent rendering in specific sections of a site.
What is the best way to fetch backend data?
The client (browser) requests data from backend systems. If authentication is required, a middleware layer running on the Edge/CDN (e.g., Edge Workers) acts as an intermediary, managing authentication and facilitating communication between the client and backend.
Browser → Middleware (Edge Worker) → Backend
Does Edge Delivery Services support server-side customizations or includes (SSI/ESI)?
Edge Delivery Services renders semantic markup (excluding fragments) on the server-side, but it does not support any server-side customizations or includes. Instead, it generates optimized, static markup that can be adjusted on the client side for styling, functionality, and personalization. While some customer CDNs support ESI, it generally introduces performance and complexity trade-offs and we have found no benefit to metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) or Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) when using ESI over client-side includes. Because of this, we do not recommend using ESI and advise against it.
How does Edge Delivery Services support taxonomy management?
Edge Delivery Services supports taxonomy management through structured metadata and hierarchical tagging. Common approaches include managing taxonomies in spreadsheets or documents to define hierarchical structures and adding tags to metadata of pages or content fragments.
External taxonomy systems or APIs can be embedded into the authoring environment as a Sidekick plugin. AI-based tagging can be implemented as an authoring plugin or directly in the delivery tier, depending on the use case.
How does Edge Delivery Services handle caching and content invalidation?
Edge Delivery Services uses caching to optimize performance while ensuring content updates are reflected quickly. When authors publish changes, the system automatically, and surgically purges cached content at multiple levels, including the CDN.
For BYO CDNs (including Cloudflare, Fastly, Akamai, and CloudFront), push invalidation can be enabled to purge content by URL and cache key whenever updates are published. Learn more on the Configuring Push Invalidation page.
How can I confirm that a push invalidation token is working?
You can use the CDN Setup tool to confirm that your CDN automatically purges outdated content when content changes are published. This tool validates your project’s vendor-specific properties and credentials.
How does the development flow look like? Is it independent of the authoring flow?
The development flow can be completely separated from the authoring flow. However, it's important to note that AEM allows parallelizing content authoring and development and thereby significantly reduces project durations. Authors and developers are encouraged to collaborate closely to ensure an optimal outcome.
See Best Practices and Anatomy of a Project for more details.
What content should be created by an author versus a developer?
Authors create content in the chosen authoring environment, while developers build site functionality using CSS and JavaScript in GitHub.
Authors and developers also create work in progress content for new features in /drafts/ folder for testing, training and development.
Is Edge Delivery Services down right now?
Edge Delivery Services is probably not down, but you can always check Adobe’s status page for real-time service updates and interruption notifications.
Indexing and SEO
What are the best practices for search engine optimization (SEO)?
Add metadata to your pages using the metadata block and metadata sheet to improve indexing. Ensure your site achieves strong Core Web Vitals (CWV) scores for fast loading and a smooth user experience. Use clear headings, alt text for images, and descriptive URLs.
How do I optimize Edge Delivery Services pages for social media sharing on platforms like Facebook and Twitter?
Set a default placeholder image to ensure consistent previews. Use the metadata block and metadata sheet to define the title, description, and other page metadata.
Can I retrieve a list of pages within a folder?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services can generate an index (or multiple indices) of pages within a folder, storing the data in a spreadsheet and serving it as JSON.
Learn more on the Indexing page.
How does Google index Edge Delivery Services pages?
Search engines, like Google, index Edge Delivery Services pages the same way they index traditional web pages by crawling the published content and evaluating metadata, page structure, and performance metrics like Core Web Vitals.
Can Google index Edge Delivery Services pages that load content fragments dynamically?
Yes, Google can index Edge Delivery Services pages that load content fragments dynamically via the fetch API. However, to avoid duplicate indexing issues, it is recommended to disable indexing for fragment URLs using the noindex directive in metadata.
How should additional fields be queried when all pages are stored in a single index?
Edge Delivery Services supports querying specific fields within a single index and suggests creating additional indexes when needed. Best practices include creating one index per language and additional dedicated indexes for common queries.
How can I include specific sections of a site in query-index.json for indexing?
Edge Delivery Services supports indexing parts of the site by configuring an index at that path of the content or via a custom index configuration.
Learn more about setting up index definitions on the Indexing page.
How do I use selectors for indexing content within the decorated DOM?
The indexing service captures the non-decorated DOM from the initial page load, before JavaScript executes. Content added dynamically won’t be indexed by default, but can be included by combining it with the indexing sheet via formulas or API calls depending on where the data needs to surface.
How do I prevent a page from being indexed?
To prevent individual pages from being indexed, add the noindex directive in the metadata block. To exclude larger site sections, configure exclusions in the bulk metadata sheet.
What strategies should I use to manage URLs and prevent SEO ranking loss?
Maintaining existing URL structure is the best way to prevent ranking loss. If simplifying or modernizing URLs during a site rebuild, use redirects to guide search engines and users to the new URLs. Temporary ranking fluctuations may occur until search engines reindex the updated content and recognize the new URLs as stable.
Does Edge Delivery Services support RSS feeds?
Edge Delivery Services does not have built-in RSS or Atom feed publishing. However, the Sidekick is extensible and it can be configured to generate Atom feeds for RSS readers from a page index.
Localization
What localization (l10n) capabilities does Edge Delivery Services support?
Edge Delivery Services supports localization by leveraging the built-in translation tools of your chosen content source. This allows customers to use familiar systems for content authoring and translation.
Learn more on the Translation and Localization page.
What are the best practices for handling localized or country-specific sites?
Organize content into different folders for each language version. Use translation tools integrated with your authoring environment. Create language-specific indices. Use placeholders for different languages.
Does Edge Delivery Services support HREFLang?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services supports HREFLang as part of sitemaps (sitemap.xml). It can be configured to reference different locales where needed.
Learn more on the Sitemaps: Multiple Sitemaps page.
Performance and Monitoring
What is Operational Telemetry?
Operational Telemetry is a service that measures how fast your site loads for actual visitors, what errors users experience, and where interactions are broken. Unlike lab-based tools like Lighthouse, Operational telemetry provides more accurate real-world performance data.
How do I enable Operational Telemetry on my site?
To enable operational telemetry, contact the AEM engineering team. They will open a pull request (PR) with the necessary JavaScript. All operational telemetry data is GDPR-compliant and does not collect personally identifiable information (PII).
Learn more on the Developing Real Use Monitoring page.
How can I track page KPIs such as completions, clicks, and impressions?
Edge Delivery Services supports tracking page KPIs through operational telemetry. Operational telemetry collection can be extended with custom checkpoints to track specific conversion events. Note that operational telemetry only samples visitor interactions and does not track individual users.
Learn more on the Developing Real Use Monitoring: Checkpoints page.
Authoring Content
What are the differences between different authoring modes, like Universal Editor and Document Authoring?
Fill out the Where To Author Your Site questionnaire and see which option fits your needs best.
Edge Delivery Services is agnostic to whichever authoring source you would like to use, but we recommend picking the right one for the actual authors who need to update content every day.
Where can I find the Edge Delivery Services URL of my document?
To find the URL of your document, open the Sidekick in your content editor and select “Preview”. This will take you to the preview URL of your page.
How do I edit pages?
Edge Delivery Services supports content editing in Microsoft Word and Excel, Google Docs and Sheets, AEM’s Universal Editor, as well as custom authoring environments.
Learn more on the Authoring Content page.
How do I publish a page?
To publish a page in Edge Delivery Services, open the Sidekick on the preview URL of your page and select “Publish”. This will make the page publicly available on your site.
Learn more on the Preview and Publish Content page.
Why are my changes in Microsoft Word not appearing on my site after previewing or publishing?
The SharePoint API can sometimes introduce a delay of up to three minutes before changes made in Microsoft Word become visible in Edge Delivery Services. To ensure changes appear immediately, manually save the document using CMD+S (Mac) or CTRL+S (Windows) before previewing and publishing.
You can also click on ‘Update’ in the Sidekick on the Preview page to get the latest saved content.
How do I unpublish a page?
To unpublish a page, first delete the corresponding source document. Then, open the Sidekick on the preview site. The “Unpublish” button will now appear, allowing you to remove the page from the public site while keeping it available in preview.
Learn more on the Authoring and Publishing Content page.
How do I delete a page?
To delete a page, first delete the corresponding source document. Then, open the Sidekick on the preview site. The “Delete” button will now appear, allowing you to remove the page from both the public site and the preview environment.
The “Unpublish” and “Delete” buttons only appear after the source document has been deleted, ensuring that pages are not removed accidentally.
Learn more on the Authoring and Publishing Content page.
Why does my new document return a “404 Not Found” error?
New documents do not automatically generate a preview URL. To create one, open the Sidekick in the editor and click “Preview”.
How do I schedule content publication in Edge Delivery Services?
Edge Delivery Services allows you to schedule API-driven publication using spreadsheets. For large-scale launches, such as a rebrand or product launch, best practices include using GitHub branches or forks and copies of large content folders to coordinate and time content changes effectively.
Learn more on the Scheduling page.
What if I have a big release of content that needs to be published at the same time?
Edge Delivery Services has APIs to support the concept of Snapshots that allow customers to Add/Remove individual pages to a collection called a “Snapshot Manifest”. The Snapshot can then be reviewed and approved/rejected. Publishing a Snapshot will take everything from the Snapshot Manifest and publish it at the same time immediately. You can use the Snapshot Admin tool to manage Snapshots.
What should I do if my content seems outdated?
First, ensure that any recent changes to the content have been saved in your authoring environment. Then, open the Sidekick and select “Preview” to refresh the preview of your page. You can also click on ‘Update’ on the Sidekick if you are in the Preview URL
How does Edge Delivery Services generate URLs? What characters are allowed?
Edge Delivery Services constructs page URLs based on document and folder names. To maintain clean and easy-to-type URLs, only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and dashes (-) are allowed. Unsupported characters are automatically transformed.
Learn more on the Document Naming page.
Does Edge Delivery Services have a WYSIWYG editor for in-browser editing?
Edge Delivery Services supports multiple authoring environments, including AEM Universal Editor, Adobe Document Authoring, and commonly used existing tools like Microsoft Word, Excel, Google Docs, and Google Sheets.
Does Edge Delivery Services support inline text styling within a paragraph?
Edge Delivery Services supports inline text styling with semantic formatting: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, subscript, superscript, and code. Colors and font settings (like font face and size) must be defined explicitly in CSS.
How do I set an image size?
Edge Delivery Services automatically optimizes image sizes, so authors do not need to manually set dimensions. Developers can use existing helper functions to get the appropriate size of the image they want to use.
How do I add alt text to images?
In Word, select the image, go to the “Picture” ribbon, and choose “Alt Text.” In Google Docs, right-click the image and select “Alt Text.”
Other authoring environments may have different interfaces for adding alt text. It’s important to ensure alt text is properly set wherever content is authored to improve accessibility and SEO of your page.
Can a metadata block be used as the first block in a document?
Yes, a metadata block can be placed anywhere in a document, including as the first block.
What is the metadata spreadsheet and how is it used?
The metadata spreadsheet is a centralized sheet for managing site-wide metadata for SEO. It allows you to set default metadata, exclude specific page sections from indexing, and more.
Learn more on the Bulk Metadata page.
How do I add name anchors to headlines in pages?
Edge Delivery Services automatically generates id attributes for all headings. For example, a heading titled “This is a Title” will be accessible via the URL fragment #this-is-a-title, eliminating the need to manually add anchors.
What do the three dashes (---) in a document do?
Three dashes indicate a section break. Sections can be useful in structuring pages, applying different background styles, or triggering animations.
Does Edge Delivery Services support videos as source content?
Yes, short videos can be uploaded to your authoring environment. After previewing and publishing the video with Sidekick, a URL will be generated that can be referenced in the source document.
Should animated GIFs or MP4 files be used for short video content?
MP4 is recommended for short videos and animations because it provides smaller file sizes, broader compatibility, and a more predictable authoring experience (while Google Docs displays animated GIFs inline, Microsoft Word only shows the first frame though the full animation is still hosted).
Can I use embeds or iframes?
Yes, the embed block supports embedding content from external sources, including iframes, such as YouTube videos.
How can I manage editable content templates?
Content templates can be managed using the templating mechanisms available in your chosen authoring environment. For example, Microsoft Word and Google Docs provide a broad range of built-in template functionality.
In any environment, you can create example documents (such as article pages, landing pages, or two-column layouts) that authors can duplicate and modify as needed.
How can I compare different versions of a page?
Version comparison is managed through the versioning features available in your chosen authoring environment. For example, Microsoft SharePoint and Word provide built-in version tracking and document comparison tools.
Many external tools, such as DiffSite, can also be used to compare differences between the preview and publish states of a page.
Does Edge Delivery Services offer content reporting or a search-and-replace feature?
Edge Delivery Services has APIs and tools like Image Audit or Page Status to help with common content reporting needs in addition to what the source content repositories provide.
While Search and Replace is easy to do in individual documents, to do it across multiple documents can be done using either the AEM Importer or other custom scripts using libraries to bulk update Word or Google documents.
How are internal and external links handled in Edge Delivery Services?
Internal links to .page and .live URLs are automatically converted into relative links to ensure proper navigation between pages. External links to third-party sites remain unchanged and function as standard external links.
How are links to documents (content source) handled?
By default, links to documents point to their original locations in the content source. If a document is published as a page on the site, its URL will match its folder structure from the source (unless a redirect is configured). For authors, it is often more intuitive to use absolute links copied and pasted from the browser.
Sidekick
What is the AEM Sidekick?
The AEM Sidekick is a browser extension that provides editing, previewing, and publishing capabilities for your Edge Delivery Services site. It can support multiple projects.
How do I install the Sidekick?
The Sidekick is available for Chrome-based browsers (including Microsoft Edge) from the Chrome web store.
What should I do if my Sidekick isn’t working?
If your Sidekick is not functioning, we recommend you reinstall the Sidekick for your project by visiting the AEM Sidekick Configurator.
With a Dynamic Media license, can authors select different asset variations in the Sidekick?
Currently, the Asset Selector Sidekick Plugin does not provide an option to pick a variation. If the customer has a Dynamic Media (DM) license with DM Open API access, they can configure the Asset Selector to copy the DM asset link as a reference. Authors can then modify the copied DM URL by appending query parameters to retrieve different asset variations.
Development and Deployment
How do I set up a local development environment?
To develop Edge Delivery Services pages locally, install Node.js and run npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli && aem up. This starts a local server that updates with code changes in real time and uses production content for accurate previews.
For a full guide to get started, visit the Developer Tutorial.
How do I create a testing or staging environment?
Edge Delivery Services is fully serverless, eliminating the need for dedicated environments. To try new functionality, simply create a branch in your GitHub repository.
Learn more on the Staging & Environments page.
How does Edge Delivery Services handle concurrent code editing by multiple developers?
As long as you are developing locally, your code remains on your machine and only content is shared. When you commit code to a GitHub repository, Git manages version control and merges changes from multiple developers.
Does Edge Delivery Services support private GitHub repositories?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services supports private GitHub repositories. As with public repositories, The AEM Code Sync bot needs to be installed on the repository.
Can Edge Delivery Services integrate with GitHub Enterprise?
Edge Delivery Services supports GitHub Enterprise Cloud but does not support GitHub Enterprise Server (because Edge Delivery Services requires access to a public GitHub API).
Does Edge Delivery Services support alternative Git repository hosts, like Bitbucket?
A GitHub repository is mandatory. However, since Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS), you can host your codebase on other platforms (like Bitbucket) and push branches to GitHub for deployment.Note: There is now the new BYOGIT feature as early access technology. It allows to directly use a bitbucket, gitlab and soon azure repos repository directly with EDS. see https://www.aem.live/developer/byo-git
What is fstab.yaml?
fstab.yaml is a configuration file that defines the content source for your site. It specifies a mountpoint using sharing URLs from your authoring environment, determining where Edge Delivery Services pulls content from. Its format is similar to an fstab file in UNIX.
With Helix 5, fstab.yaml is no longer required. Content sources can now be configured via the Configuration Service API, allowing the same code repository can be reused across multiple sites in a repoless fashion.
Does Edge Delivery Services support multiple content mountpoints in fstab.yaml?
No, each project can have only one content source in both fstab.yaml or the Configuration Service.
How does code move from .page to .live?
When code is pushed to any branch in GitHub, the AEM Code Sync app automatically syncs it to the Codebus, making it available on both .page and .live.
How is continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) configured?
Edge Delivery Services works in a scaled trunk-based development model. Since there is no build process required, it makes developer velocity much faster. Customers can add their internal processes via Github Actions and Workflows to also trigger other processes and build checks needed during Pull Requests.
How does Edge Delivery Services handle caching for head.html updates? Do I need to clear the cache manually?
When you update head.html, Edge Delivery Services automatically purges the cache for all HTML pages, ensuring that changes take effect immediately. Manual cache clearing is not required.
Do I need to protect against DOS attacks with a WAF on our CDN?
Edge Delivery Services origins are designed to withstand common internet attacks, including typical scripted and DOS attacks. The AEM security and operations team continuously implements countermeasures to mitigate risks. Because your CDN may also connect to other origins beyond Edge Delivery Services, you may still want to use WAF services to protect those additional origins.
Learn more on the Security page.
Should redirects be managed on the CDN, or does Edge Delivery Services handle them?
Edge Delivery Services supports redirect management through a “redirects” spreadsheet stored in the root folder of your project in your authoring environment. This allows for centralized control of URL redirects without requiring CDN-level configuration.
Why do content-based assets return a 301 redirect to a media_ image?
When an asset is previewed, it is uploaded to the media bus, which stores it immutably. To maintain a human-readable filename, the asset can still be addressed by its original name. During delivery, the request is redirected (via 301) to the immutable media bus URL for retrieval.
Can I configure redirects to return a 302 (temporarily moved) status code?
Edge Delivery Services only supports 301 (permanently moved) redirects through the redirects spreadsheet file to optimize caching. Other kinds of redirects must be configured at the CDN level.
What is the character limit for a branch/subdomain?
Edge Delivery Services subdomains follow the format branch--repo--owner. The combined length of the branch, repository, and owner name (including the two required separators [--]) cannot exceed 63 characters. This is a DNS limitation and is not specific to Edge Delivery Services.
For more details, see the DNS size limits section in RFC 1035.
What is the policy on using cookies or localStorage to store application state?
Edge Delivery Services does not process cookies on the server side. We recommend using URL parameters to store application state.
Content Blocks
Does Edge Delivery Services have something like components?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services uses “blocks” as our components. A block is a reusable section of a page. By default, Edge Delivery Services displays document content as-is, but blocks allow for specific functionality and styling.
How do I create a block?
To create a block, place your content inside a table with a header row containing the block name. Edge Delivery Services will recognize this structure and apply the corresponding functionality or styling.
Learn more on the Exploring Blocks: How They Work page.
Where can I find a list of available blocks?
Available blocks vary by project. Many projects maintain a block inventory (or “kitchen sink”) page that showcases the available blocks and their structure.
Edge Delivery Services boiler plate code includes a set of commonly used blocks. Apart from that there is Block Collection boilerplate that includes additional blocks .
Learn more about Block Collection
Does Edge Delivery Services support nested blocks?
No, Edge Delivery Services does not support nested blocks to keep authoring simple and manageable. However, nested structures can be achieved in other author-friendly ways. For example, nested fragments can be used for more complex layouts.
How can I implement a design system?
To implement a design system in Edge Delivery Services, leverage (or expand) the existing CSS variables for design tokens and ensure blocks are reusable across pages.
How can I reuse content across multiple pages in Edge Delivery Services, like AEM’s Content and Experience Fragments?
Edge Delivery Services supports centrally managed content reuse through the fragment block, which embeds content from one page into another. Edge Delivery Services loads headers and footers as fragments by default.
What is the equivalent of Core Components in Edge Delivery Services?
The Block Collection serves as the equivalent of Core Components in Edge Delivery Services. The collection provides a set of pre-built, extensible blocks designed for modern websites, providing an easily customizable foundation for any project.
How do blocks compare to Web Components?
Blocks are a core feature of Edge Delivery Services, integrating seamlessly with minimal setup. They are easy to author, optimized for performance, and are built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Web Components provide encapsulation and cross-platform reusability, making them valuable for design systems. However, they require careful lifecycle and performance management to avoid unnecessary overhead.
Frameworks and Web Technologies
Are Web Components recommended for Edge Delivery Services projects?
Web Components can be used in Edge Delivery Services projects, but they are not the default recommendation. While they offer modularity and reusability, they require careful optimization to avoid impacting performance.
Learn more on the Web Components page.
Can I integrate Web Components from a design system into Edge Delivery Services?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services supports integrating Web Components from design systems. Web Components should be initialized within blocks and only loaded when needed to avoid unnecessary overhead.
Can I use JavaScript frameworks?
Edge Delivery Services does not require a specific frontend framework, but supports integration with frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and Svelte. The recommended approach is to use technologies such as React Portals or Web Components within application-centric blocks while keeping simpler blocks in plain CSS and JavaScript for optimal web performance.
When loading external components that are render-critical for the largest contentful paint (LCP), make sure to load them from the same host as the main website, so you avoid the performance penalty of a second DNS lookup and TLS handshake. This can be accomplished by mapping the path in the CDN or pushing the required components into the site's git repository.
Can I use CSS frameworks?
Yes, CSS frameworks like Less, PostCSS, and TailwindCSS can be used in Edge Delivery Services. CSS frameworks should be used thoughtfully, balancing page speed with layout shifts while keeping styling readable and maintainable. Usually, using any framework also adds a build step that can slow down development velocity and is not as instantaneous anymore which is a big advantage of going without a framework.
Does Edge Delivery Services support server-side rendering (SSR) for Lit-based Web Components?
No, Edge Delivery Services does not support any server-side customizations. Instead, it generates optimized, semantic markup that can be decorated on the client side for styling, functionality, and personalization. This ensures flexibility while maintaining optimized performance.
Integrations and Third-Party Tools
What are the performance considerations when integrating with third-party tools?
Integrating third-party tools can impact performance, especially if they block rendering or delay LCP (Largest Contentful Paint). Avoid adding scripts in <head.html> to keep the critical rendering path clear. Instead, load scripts only when needed using loadScript() within specific blocks or IntersectionObserver to defer execution. Defer non-essential integrations and tools, such as analytics or tag managers, until after page load to reduce Total Blocking Time (TBT) and improve user experience.
Want to maintain high performance? Check out the Keeping It 100 guide.
Can I integrate with AEM Sites?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services can be seamlessly integrated. Edge Delivery Services is a part of AEM Sites!
Can I use Adobe Target?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services is compatible with Adobe Target. Learn more at the Configuring Adobe Target Integration page.
Additionally, Edge Delivery Services features a built-in experimentation framework that enables quick test creation, execution without performance impact, and fast deployment of test winners.
Can I use Adobe Analytics?
Yes, Adobe Analytics can be integrated with Edge Delivery Services just like on any other website.
Can I use Adobe Launch?
Yes, Adobe Launch can be integrated with Edge Delivery Services just like on any other website.
Can I use AEM Forms?
Yes, with a valid AEM Forms license, Edge Delivery Services supports AEM Forms through the Adaptive Forms Block, allowing you to create, style, and manage forms within your site.
Learn more on the Forms page.
Can I use Marketo forms?
Yes, Marketo forms can be embedded in Edge Delivery Services pages using the Marketo Forms API or iframe embed codes.
Is there a default forms capability that can send email on submission?
No, Edge Delivery Services does not include a default forms capability that sends emails on submission. However, you can integrate services like AEM Forms, Adobe Campaign, Workfront, or external email APIs to handle form submissions and email notifications.
Can I use AEM Assets?
Yes, AEM Assets can be used in Edge Delivery Services by configuring the AEM Assets Sidekick plugin. This allows authors to access and use AEM Assets within SharePoint or Google Docs.
Does Edge Delivery Services support Cloudflare?
Yes, you can run a Cloudflare CDN in front of Edge Delivery Services to add a custom domain or integrate Edge Delivery Services into an existing site.
Learn more on the Cloudflare Setup page.
Does AEM support Fastly?
Yes, you can run a Fastly CDN in front of Edge Delivery Services to add a custom domain or integrate Edge Delivery Services into an existing site.

Does Edge Delivery Services support Akamai?
Yes, you can run an Akamai CDN in front of Edge Delivery Services to add a custom domain or integrate Edge Delivery Services into an existing site.
Learn more on the Akamai Setup page.
Can I use Google Tag Manager?
Yes, Google Tag Manager can be integrated with Edge Delivery Services just like on any other website.
Can I integrate with OneTrust for consent management?
Yes, OneTrust can be integrated with Edge Delivery Services just like on any other website.
Can I integrate translation tools?
Yes, third-party translation tools can be integrated into Edge Delivery Services. While Edge Delivery Services natively supports translation features within content sources, additional translation services can be incorporated at the content source or CDN tier for more advanced localization needs.
Can I integrate a third-party search solution?
Yes, integrating a third-party site search is common for large websites. The built-in sitemap feature is typically used to facilitate this integration. Edge Delivery Services includes out-of-the-box indexing, which provides a fast and simple search option for most websites.
Can I import content from other platforms to Edge Delivery Services?
Yes, Edge Delivery Services supports content migration from various platforms, including WordPress, Unsplash, Contentful, other AEM instances, and more. The AEM team will help you in the import process, ensuring your content from any CMS is converted.
How do I configure Edge Delivery Services with Dynamic Media and Smart Cropping?
Smart cropping can be configured within AEM Assets.
Legal and Compliance
What is the service level agreement (SLA) for Edge Delivery Services?
The SLA for Edge Delivery Services is the same as the SLA for AEM as a Cloud Service. You can check Adobe Status for availability of all Adobe services.
How can I report the misuse of an Adobe product or service?

The Anatomy of a Project
This document describes what a typical project should look like from a code standpoint. Before reading this document, please familiarize yourself with the document Getting Started - Developer Tutorial.
Git and GitHub
One of our defining philosophies is that it is easiest to allow users to work with the tools that they are familiar with. The overwhelming majority of developers manage their code in systems based on Git, so it only makes sense to allow developers to work with Git to manage and deploy their code.
We are using a buildless approach that runs directly from your GitHub repo. After installing the AEM GitHub bot on your repo, websites are automatically created for each of your branches for content preview on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/ and the production site on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live/ for published content.
Every resource that you put into your GitHub repo is available on your website, so a file in your GitHub repo on the main branch in /scripts/scripts.js will be available on https://main--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/scripts/scripts.jsThis should be very intuitive. There are few “special” files that Adobe Experience Manager uses to connect the content into your website.
We strongly recommend that repos are kept public on GitHub, to foster the community. For a public facing website there really is no need to keep the code hidden, as it is being served to the browsers of your website.
Important notes:
The combination <branch>--<repo>--<owner> must not exceed 63 characters (including the hyphens/dashes). This is a subdomain name constraint.
branch, repo and owner cannot contain --.
Configuration Files
There are some files in your GitHub repo that have a special meaning to AEM and are processed in a special fashion. These files are in the root directory of your repo.
The Content Connection: fstab.yaml
As you may have seen in the getting started guide the fstab.yaml file serves as the connection to your Google Drive or SharePoint folders that contain your content. This file is used as an indicator for how the code in your GitHub repo gets combined with the content in your content source.
Beyond providing the connection to the content, the fstab.yaml also provides a folder mapping facility that allows you map extensionless “routes” to a given piece of content or static HTML.
The Entry Point: head.html
The head.html file is the most important extension point to influence the markup of the content. The easiest way to think of it is that this file is injected on the server side as part of the <head> HTML tag and is combined with the metadata coming from the content.
The head.html should remain largely unchanged from the boilerplate and there are only very few legitimate reasons in a regular project to make changes. Those include remapping your project to a different base URL for the purposes of exposing your project in a different folder than the root folder of your domain on your CDN or to support legacy browsers which usually require scripts that are not loaded as modules.
Adding marketing technology like Adobe Web SDK, Google Tag Manager or other 3rd party scripts to your head.html file is strongly advised against due to performance impacts. Adding inline scripts or styles to head.html is also not advisable for performance and code management reasons, see the section Scripts and Styles below for more information about handling scripts and styles.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/helix-project-boilerplate/blob/main/head.html
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/head.html
https://github.com/adobe/business-website/blob/main/head.html
Not Found: 404.html
To create a custom 404 response, place a 404.html file into the root of your github repository. This will be served on any URL that doesn’t map to an existing resource in either content or code, and replaces the body of the out of the box minimalist 404 response.
The 404 can mimic the markup of an existing page including your code for the site, with navigation footers etc., or it can have a completely different appearance.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/hlxsites/bamboohr-website/blob/main/404.html See in Action
https://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/404.html See in Action
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/404.html See in Action
Don’t Serve: .hlxignore
There are some files in your repo that should not be served from your website, either because you would like to keep them private or they are not relevant to the delivery of the website (e.g. tests, build tools, build artifacts, etc.) and don’t need to be observed by the AEM bot. You can add those to a .hlxignore file in the same format as the well-known .gitignore file.
Please see the following example.
https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/.hlxignore
Tame the Bots: robots.txt
A robots.txt file is generally a regular file that is served as you would expect on your production website on your own domain. To protect your preview and origin site from being indexed, your .page and .live sites will serve a robots.txt file that disallows all robots instead of the robots.txt file from your repo.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/robots.txt
https://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/robots.txt
https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/robots.txt
Query and Indexing: helix-query.yaml
There is a flexible indexing facility that lets you keep track of all of your content pages conveniently as a spreadsheet. This facility is often used to show lists or feeds of pages as well as to filter and sort content on a website. Please see the document Indexing for more information.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
Automate Your Sitemap: helix-sitemap.yaml
Complex sitemaps can automatically be created for you whenever authors publish new content, including flexible hreflang mappings where needed. This functionality is usually based on the indexing facility.See this GitHub issue for sitemap configuration options.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/fedpub/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
Commonly Used File and Folder Structure
Beyond the files treats as special or configuration files, there is a commonly-used structure that is expressed in the Boilerplate repo.
The common folders below are usually in the root directory of a project repo, but in cases where only a portion of a website is handled by AEM, they are often moved to a subfolder to reflect the mapping of the route of the origin in a CDN.
This means that in a case where for example only /en/blog/ is initially mapped to AEM from the CDN, all the folder structures below (eg. /scripts, /styles, /blocks etc.) are moved into a the /en/blog/ folder in GitHub to keep the CDN mapping as simple as possible.
With a simple adjustment of the reference to scripts.js and styles.css in head.html (see above) it is possible to indicate that all the necessary files are loaded from the respective code base directory. To avoid url rewriting the folder structure is also created the content source (eg. sharepoint or google drive) by having a directory structure of /en/blog/.In many cases as the AEM footprint grows on a site there is a point in time when the code gets moved back to the root folder and the head.html references are adjusted accordingly.
Scripts and Styles
By convention in a AEM project, the head.html references styles.css, scripts.js, and aem.js located in /scripts and /styles, as the entry points for the project code.
scripts.js is where your global custom javascript code lives and is where the block loading code is triggered. styles.css hosts the global styling information for your site, and minimally contains the global layout information that is needed to display the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).As all three files are loaded before the page can be displayed, it is important that they are kept relatively small and executed efficiently.Beyond styles.css, a lazy-styles.css file is commonly used, which is loaded after the LCP event, and therefore can contain slower/more CSS information. This could be a good place for fonts or global CSS that is below the fold.
In addition to scripts.js, there is the commonly-used delayed.js. This is a catch-all for libraries that need to be loaded on a page but should be kept from interfering with the delivery of the page. This is a good place for code that is outside of the control of your project and usually includes the martech stack and other libraries.
Please see the document Keeping it 100, Web Performance for more information about optimizing your site performance.
Blocks
Most of the project-specific CSS and JavaScript code lives in blocks. Authors create blocks in their documents. Developers then write the corresponding code that styles the blocks with CSS and/or decorates the DOM to take the markup of a block and transform it to the structure that’s needed or convenient for desired styling and functionality.
The block name is used as both the folder name of a block as well as the filename for the .css and .js files that are loaded by the block loader when a block is used on a page.
The block name is also used as the CSS class name on the block to allow for intuitive styling. The javascript is loaded as a module (ESM) and exports a default function that is executed as part of the block loading.
A simple example is the Columns Block. It adds additional classes in JavaScript based on how many columns are in the respective instance created by the author. This allows it to be able to use flexible styling of content that is in two columns vs. three columns.
Icons
Most projects have SVG files that are usually added to the /icons folder, and can be referenced with a :<iconname>: notation by authors. By default, icons are inlined into the DOM so they can be styled with CSS, without having to create SVG symbols.

http://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection

Block Collection
This is a collection of blocks considered a part of the AEM product and are recommended as blueprints for blocks in your project.
These blocks come from real production AEM projects. To be a part of this collection, a block needs to have a high use across a number of projects and provide enough abstract functionality and be general enough so it can be reused without having to change the underlying content model.
As the needs and designs of websites change, the block collection will change as well. Additions will be made to reflect emerging needs of projects, but blocks that are not used frequently enough will also be removed (deprecated).
There are few technical principles for the blocks in the collection:
Intuitive: Content structure that’s intuitive and easy to author
Useable: No dependencies, compatible with boilerplate
Responsive: Works across all breakpoints
Context Aware: Inherits CSS context such text and background colors
Localizable: No hard-coded content
Fast: No negative performance impact
SEO and A11y: SEO friendly and accessible
All of the blocks can be considered as a basis for your own block development. It is very likely that you will change all the .css and .js code to meet your own project needs. The primary value of these blocks is the content structure they provide.Considering that the code of your block will be fully adapted to your project, there is no intent for the blocks in the collection to be backwards compatible to their respective older versions or to make them upgradable.
Boilerplate
The most commonly used blocks (as well as default content types) are curated in the AEM Boilerplate and are a part of every AEM project. For a block to become a part of boilerplate it has to be used by the vast majority of all AEM projects.
The code base for all the blocks in AEM Boilerplate is open-source and can be found on GitHub adobe/aem-boilerplate

Block Collection
The block collection contains blocks that are commonly-used, but are not so common to be considered boilerplate. As a rule-of-thumb, to be included in the block collection a block must be used on more than half of all AEM projects.
The block collection can be the entry path into boilerplate code. Likewise if a block in the boilerplate is no longer used as much, it can be moved to this collection.
The code base for all the blocks in AEM Block Collection is open-source and can be found on GitHub adobe/aem-block-collection

The block collection is continually evolving based on the feedback from the AEM community. If you think that there is a block that should be included in the block collection please speak to your AEM contact. Current candidates for inclusion in the block collection include:
Consent Banner
If you have immediate need of a block that is not yet part of the collection, it is relatively easy to find AEM projects on GitHub that have example implementations for all of the above candidates.
Block Party
The Block Party is a place for the AEM developer community to showcase what they have built on AEM sites. It also allows others to avoid reinventing the wheel and reuse these blocks / code snippets / integrations built by the community and tweak the code as necessary to fit their own projects. See Block Party for everything it has to offer.
Note: While we love and support our AEM developer community, Adobe is not responsible for maintaining or updating the code that is showcased in Block Party. Please use the code at your own discretion.

Spreadsheets and JSON
In addition to translating Google Docs and Word documents into markdown and HTML markup, AEM also translates spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel workbooks and Google Sheets) into JSON files that can easily be consumed by your website or web application.
This enables many uses for content that is table-oriented or structured.
Sheets and Sheet structure
The simplest example of a sheet consists of a table that uses the first row as column names and the subsequent rows as data. An example might look something like this.
After a preview and publish via the sidekick, AEM translates this table to a JSON representation which is served to requests to the corresponding .json resource. The above example gets translated to:
AEM allows you to manage workbooks with multiple sheets.
If there is only one sheet, AEM will by default use that sheet as the source of the information.
If there are multiple sheets, AEM will deliver sheets that have names prefixed with shared-. This lets you keep sheets in the same workbook that will not be exposed.
If there is a sheet named shared-default, AEM will deliver it as a single sheet, unless there is a query parameter pointing to a different sheet.
If there are multiple sheets with shared- prefix, AEM will deliver them in multi-sheet format. See below for an example.
Note: the helix- prefix is deprecated and the more neutral shared- prefix should be used.
See the query parameter section for details on how to query a specific sheet.
Multi-Sheet Format
If there are multiple sheets with shared- prefix, AEM will deliver them in multi-sheet format. Here's an example of a payload with 2 sheets:
The :names property contains an array with all the names of the contained sheets.
For each sheet name in :names there is a property in the payload. The value is the corresponding sheet data in single sheet format.
Query Parameters
Offset and Limit
Spreadsheets and JSON files can get very large. In such cases, AEM supports the use of limit and offset query parameters to indicate which rows of the spreadsheet are delivered. In case of a multi-sheet, offset and limit are applied to all sheets in the payload.
As AEM always compresses the JSON, payloads are generally relatively small. Therefore by default AEM limits the number of rows it returns to 1000 if the limit query parameter is not specified. This is sufficient for many simple cases.
Sheet
The sheet query parameter allows an application to specify one or multiple specific sheets in the spreadsheet or workbook. As an example ?sheet=jobs will return the sheet named shared-jobs and ?sheet=jobs&sheet=articles will return the data for the sheets named shared-jobs and shared-articles.
Special Sheet Names
In certain use cases, AEM also writes to spreadsheets, where it expects specific sheet names:
The indexing service only writes to a sheet named raw_index, which may be delivered via JSON in a single sheet setup.
Arrays
Native arrays are not supported as cell values, so they are delivered as strings.
"tags": "[\"Adobe Life\",\"Responsibility\",\"Diversity & Inclusion\"]"
You can turn them back into arrays in JavaScript using JSON.parse().

http://www.aem.live/developer/indexing

Indexing
Adobe Experience Manager offers a way to keep an index of all the published pages in a particular section of your website. This is commonly used to build lists, feeds, and enable search and filtering use cases for your pages or content fragments.
AEM keeps this index in a spreadsheet and offers access to it using JSON. Please see the document Spreadsheets and JSON for more information.
We will introduce the concept of creating a query index by previewing an Excel workbook or Google spreadsheet first. Note, that if you already have a custom query definition in a file called helix-query.yaml in your GitHub repository, it is no longer possible to create indexes that way. Every new index will have to be manually added to that helix-query.yaml.
Setting Up an Initial Query Index
In this section we’ll create a query index in the root folder that will index all documents in your backend.
After setting up your fstab.yaml with a mountpoint that points into your SharePoint site or Google Drive, go to the root folder.
Depending on your backend, create either a workbook named query-index.xlsx for SharePoint or a spreadsheet named query-index for Google Drive.
In that spreadsheet or workbook, create a sheet named raw_index.
Setting Up Properties to be Added to the Index
In your query-index document, add a header line and in the first column add path as the header name.
In the following columns of the header line, add all other properties you need extracted from the rendered HTML page.
In the following example in Google Drive, the extracted fields are title, image, description, and lastModified.
Pages are indexed when they are published. To remove pages from index, they have to be unpublished.
For simple scenarios without custom index definition, pages that have robots metadata property set to noindex will automatically be omitted from indexing by AEM. (There are a few special scenarios here, for more details see the section Special Scenarios for Robots).
The following table summarizes the properties that are available and from where in the HTML page they’re extracted.
Returns the content of the meta tag named article:tag in the head element as an array.
See the document Spreadsheets and JSON for more information on array-handling.
For every other header added, the indexer will try to find a meta tag with a corresponding name.
Activate Your Index
To activate your index, preview the spreadsheet using the sidekick. This will create an index configuration.
Checking Your Index
The Admin Service has an API endpoint where you can check the index representation of your page. Given your GitHub owner, repository, branch and owner, and a resource path to a page, its endpoint is:
https://admin.hlx.page/index/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/<path>
You should get a JSON response where the data node contains the index representation of the page.
Debugging Your Index Configuration
The AEM CLI has a feature where it will print the index record whenever you change your query configuration, which assists in finding the correct CSS selectors:
$ aem up --print-index
Please see the AEM CLI GitHub documentation for more information and watch this video to learn more about this feature.
Setting Up More Index Configurations
You can define your own custom index configurations by creating your own helix-query.yaml. This allows you to have more than one index configuration in the same helix-query.yaml, where parts of your sites are indexed into different Excel workbooks or Google spreadsheets. See the document Indexing reference for more information.
Special Scenarios for Robots
There are a few nuances on how pages get indexed by AEM in conjunction with indexing setup for your site. Let’s look at them:
In the following 2 situations, setting robots to noindex on the page metadata would not prevent it from being indexed by AEM:
You have added a robots column in query-index.xlsx
You have a helix-query.yaml in your Github repository i.e. you have defined a custom index definition.
Recommendations
If you do not have a custom index definition, it is recommended to not add a robots column to your index sheet unless you have a requirement for doing so.Adding robots column to your index sheet would cause a page to be indexed by AEM even though it may have robots metadata set to noindex.
If you do have a custom index definition, pages would get indexed by AEM irrespective of setting robots to noindex on the page metadata. If you want to prevent this from happening, you can use spreadsheet filters to omit pages from index that have robots metadata set to noindex. For more details, see the section titled "Enforcing noindex configuration with custom index definitions" below.
Enforcing “noindex” configuration with custom index definitions
If you have defined your own custom index definitions in helix-query.yaml, setting the robots property to noindex is not effective in preventing the pages from getting indexed. In order to enforce noindex configuration is such situations, do the following:
Create a sheet named “helix-default” in your query-index.xlsx . After this, your query-index.xlsx spreadsheet should have 2 sheets “raw_index” and “helix-default”. The “raw_index” sheet is there to have all the raw indexed data.
Modify your custom helix-query.yaml (it must be in your project’s Github repository) and add the robots property so that it gets indexed.
Now set up your “helix-default” sheet in the query-index.xlsx spreadsheet to get automatically filled up using Excel formula which ensures that all the rows in raw_index which have robots property set as noindex, do not get copied over to the helix-default sheet. This can be done by using an Excel formula like this =FILTER(Table1,NOT(Table1[robots]="noindex"))
Now your helix-default sheet has only the rows from raw_index that do not have robots property set to noindex.
Ensure that you publish the pages that you want to get indexed.
Now if you fetch the index as usual like: https://<branch>--<repo>-<org>.hlx.page/query-index.json, you’d only get data from helix-default sheet i.e. entries that are not explicitly prevented from getting indexed through the robot property set as noindex.

Web Performance, Keeping your Lighthouse Score 100.
The quality of the experience of websites is crucial to achieving the business goals of your website and the satisfaction of your visitors.
Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is optimized to deliver excellent experiences and optimal web performance. With the Real Use Monitoring (RUM) operations data collection, information is continuously collected from field use and offers a way to iterate on real use performance measurements without having to wait for the CRuX data to show effects of code and deployment changes. It is common for field data collected in RUM to deviate from the lab results, as the network, geo-location and processing power for real devices are much more diverse than the simulated conditions in a lab.
The Google PageSpeed Insight Service is proven to be a great lab measurement tool. It can be used to avoid the slow deterioration of the performance and experience score of your website.
If you start your project with the Boilerplate as in the Developer Tutorial, you will get a very stable Lighthouse score on PageSpeed Insight for both Mobile and Desktop at 100. On every component of the lighthouse score there is some buffer for the project code to consume and still be within the boundaries of a perfect 100 lighthouse score.
Testing Your Pull Requests
It turns out that it is hard to improve your Lighthouse score once it is low, but it is not hard to keep it at 100 if you continuously test.
When you open a pull request (PR) on a project, the test URLs in the description of your project are used to run the PageSpeed Insights Service against. The AEM GitHub bot will automatically fail your PR if the score is below 100 with a little bit of buffer to account for some volatility of the results.
The results are for the mobile lighthouse score, as they tend to be harder to achieve than desktop.
Why Google PageSpeed Insights?
Many teams and individuals use their own configurations for measuring Lighthouse scores. Different teams have developed their own test harnesses and use their own test tools with configurations that have been set up as part of their continuous monitoring and performance reporting practices.
The performance of a website impacts its rankings in search results, which is reflected by the Core Web Vitals in the crUX report. Google has a great handle on the relevant average combinations of device information (e.g. screen size) as well as network performance of those devices. But in the end, SEO is the ultimate arbiter of what good vs. bad web performance is. As the specific configuration is a moving target, performance practices should be aligned with the current average devices and network characteristics globally.
So instead of using a project specific configuration for Lighthouse testing, we use the continuously-updated configurations seen as part of the mobile and desktop strategies referenced in the latest versions of the Google PageSpeed Insights API.
While there may be additional insight that some developers feel they can collect from other ways of measuring Lighthouse scores, to be able to have a meaningful and comparable performance conversation across projects, there needs to be a way to measure performance universally. The default PageSpeed Insight Service is the most authoritative, most widely accepted lab test when it comes to measuring your performance.However it is important to remember that the recommendations that you get from PageSpeed Insights do not necessarily lead to better results, especially the closer you get to a lighthouse score of 100.Core Web Vitals (CWV) collected by the built-in RUM data collection play an important role in validating results. For minor changes, however, the variance of the results and the lack of sufficient data points (traffic) over a short period of time makes it impractical to get statistically relevant results in most cases.
Three-Phase Loading (E-L-D)
Dissecting the payload that's on a web page into three phases makes it relatively straight-forward to achieve a clean lighthouse score and therefore set a baseline for a great customer experience.
The three phase loading approach divides the payload and execution of the page into three phases
Phase E (Eager): This contains everything that's needed to get to the largest contentful paint (LCP).
Phase L (Lazy): This contains everything that is controlled by the project and largely served from the same origin.
Phase D (Delayed): This contains everything else such as third-party tags or assets that are not material to experience.
Phase E: Eager
Before anything happens, it is important to note that the body must be hidden (with display:none) to make sure no images start downloading and to avoid initial CLS.
In the eager phase, the first action is to “decorate” the DOM: the loading sequence makes few adjustments, mainly adds CSS classes to icons, buttons, blocks and sections and creates the auto-blocks. See the Markup, Sections, Blocks, and Auto Blocking page for more details on the resulting markup.
The body can then already be displayed, considering that sections are not loaded yet and remain hidden.
Then, the full first section is loaded with a priority given to the first image of this section, the “LCP candidate”. In theory, the fewer blocks the first section has, the faster LCP can be loaded.
Once the LCP candidate and all blocks of the section are loaded, the first section can be displayed and the fonts can start loading asynchronously.
This ends the eager phase.
LCP
In general, the LCP is the “hero“ image displayed at the top of a page. It is crucial to make sure this image is loaded and displayed as soon as possible in the loading sequence (see the Eager phase).
Everything that's needed to be loaded for the true LCP to be displayed must be loaded. In a project, this usually consists of the markup, the CSS styles and JavaScript files.
In many cases the LCP element is contained in a block, where the block .js and and .css also have to be loaded.
It is a good rule of thumb to keep the aggregate payload before the LCP is displayed below 100kb, which usually results in an LCP event quicker than 1560ms (LCP scoring at 100 in PSI). Especially on mobile the network tends to be bandwidth constrained, so changing the loading sequence before LCP has minimal to no impact.
Loading from or connecting to a second origin before the LCP occurred is strongly discouraged as establishing a second connection (TLS, DNS, etc.) adds a significant delay to the LCP.
There are situations where the actual LCP element is not included in the markup that is transmitted to the client. This happens when there is an indirection or lookup (for example a service that’s called, a fragment that’s loaded or a lookup that needs to happen in a .json) for the LCP element.In those situations, it is important that the page loading waits with guessing the LCP candidate (currently the first image on the page) until the first block has made the necessary changes to the DOM.
There are other situations where the content contains 2 hero images, one for desktop, one for mobile. Same as above, it is important to make sure that the correct image is considered as the LCP candidate and the “hero” block might need to be adjusted to remove the unnecessary image from the DOM (remove the desktop image on mobile devices or vice versa) to not load a bandwidth consuming image or even worse, load the unnecessary image first as the LCP candidate.
Finally, the LCP can be something other than an image, a video, a long text… For all those cases, a deep understanding of the loading sequence and how the LCP candidate is computed is necessary to make the correct optimizations.
Phase L: Lazy
In the lazy phase, the portion of the payload is loaded that doesn't affect total blocking time (TBT) and ultimately first input delay (FID).
This includes things like loading the next sections and their blocks (JavaScript and CSS) as well as loading all the remaining images according to their loading="lazy" attribute and other JavaScript libraries that are not blocking. The lazy phase is generally everything that happens in the various blocks you are going to create to cover the project needs.
In this phase it would still be advisable that the bulk of the payload come from the same origin and is controlled by the first party, so that changes can be made if needed to avoid negative impact on TBT, TTI and FID.
Phase D: Delayed
In the delayed phase, the parts of the payload are loaded that don't have an immediate impact to the experience and/or are not controlled by the project and come from third parties. Think of marketing tooling, consent management, extended analytics, chat/interaction modules etc. which are often deployed through tag management solutions.
It is important to understand that for the impact on the overall customer experience to be minimized, the start of this phase needs to be significantly delayed. The delayed phase should be at least three seconds after the LCP event to leave enough time for the rest of the experience to get settled.
The delayed phase is usually handled in delayed.js which serves as an initial catch-all for scripts that cause TBT. Ideally, the TBT problems are removed from the scripts in question either by loading them outside of the main thread (in a web worker) or by just removing the actual blocking time from the code. Once the problems are fixed, those libraries can easily be added to the lazy phase and be loaded earlier.
Ideally there is no blocking time in your scripts, which is sometimes hard to achieve as commonly used technology like tag managers or build tooling create large JavaScript files that are blocking as the browser is parsing them. From a performance perspective it is advisable to remove those techniques, make sure your individual scripts are not blocking and load them individually as separate smaller files.
Header and Footer
The header and specifically the footer of the page are not in the critical path to the LCP, which is why they are loaded asynchronously in their respective blocks. Generally, resources that do not share the same life cycle (meaning that they are updated with authoring changes at different times) should be kept in separate documents to make the caching chain between the origins and the browser simpler and more effective. Keeping those resources separate increases cache hit ratios and reduces cache invalidation and cache management complexity.
Fonts
Since web fonts are often a strain on bandwidth and loaded from a different origin via a font service like https://fonts.adobe.com or https://fonts.google.com, it is largely impossible to load fonts before the LCP, this is why they are loaded right after.
By default, the AEM Boilerplate implements the font fallback technique to avoid CLS when the font is loaded. It would be counterproductive to preload the fonts (via Early hints, h2-push or markup) and largely impact the performances.
Bonus: Speed is Green
Building websites that are fast, small, and quick to render is not just a good idea to deliver exceptional experiences that convert better, it is also a good way to reduce carbon emissions.
Common Sources of Performance Issues
Over time, we gathered a collection of anti-patterns that negatively impact performance, and need to be avoided to be compliant with the best practices in this document.
Early hints / h2-push / pre-connect are part of the network budget
Instinctively, it would make sense to tell the browser to download as much as possible and as early as possible, even before the markup processing even starts. But remember, the ultimate goal is to have a stable page to show to the visitor as quickly as possible. LCP timing is a good proxy for that.
As a rule of thumb, to get an LCP to 100 on Mobile with PageSpeed Insight the network constraints are set up in a way that there can only be a single host with a network payload that's not exceeding 100kb, as the setup is largely bandwidth constrained. Early hints, h2-push and pre-connect consume that bandwidth, by downloading resources that are not required for LCP and therefore negatively impact the performance, and have to be removed.
Redirects for paths resolution
If a visitor requests www.domain.com and gets redirected to www.domain.com/en and then to www.domain.com/en/home, they get a penalty for each redirect, i.e. performance is negatively impacted. This is mostly visible in Core Web Vitals measured via RUM or CrUX as lab results in PageSpeed Insights by default exclude redirect overhead from the lab test.
CDN client scripts injection
Our markup but also our .aem.page and .aem.live origins are optimized for performance and we are extremely careful with any part of the payload, as well as the loading sequence for resources.
Some CDN vendors and configurations inject scripts that are consuming bandwidth and create blocking time, before LCP with negative impacts performance. Those scripts should be disabled, or loaded appropriately in the loading sequence after LCP.
A comparison of a .aem.live origin of the PageSpeed Insight report, with the corresponding site that's fronted by a customers CDN (e.g. production site) will show the negative impact produced by a CDN outside of AEM's control.
CDN TTFB and Protocol Implementation Impact
Depending on the CDN vendor, there are differences in protocol implementations and performance characteristics for the pure delivery of the HTTP payload. Additional tooling like WAF and other network infrastructure upstream of AEM may also negatively impact performance.A comparison of a .aem.live origin of the PageSpeed Insight report, with the corresponding site that's fronted by a customers CDN (e.g. production site) will show the negative impact produced by a CDN outside of AEM's control.

Markup, Sections, Blocks, and Auto Blocking
To design websites and create functionality, developers use the markup and DOM that is rendered dynamically from the content. The markup and DOM are constructed in a way that allows flexible manipulation and styling. At the same time it provides out-of-the-box functionality so the developer does not have to worry about some of the aspects of modern websites.
Structure of a Document
The single most important aspect when structuring a document is to make it simple and intuitive for authors who will contribute the content.
This means that it is strongly recommended to involve authors very early in the process. In many cases it is good practice to just let authors put the content that needs to go on to a page into a Google Doc or Word document without having any notion of blocks and section, and then try to make small structural changes and introduce sections and blocks only where necessary.
A document follows the following structure in the abstract.
A page as authored in Word or a Google Doc document uses the well-understood semantic model like headings, body text, lists, images, links, etc. that is shared between HTML, markdown, and Google Doc / Word. We call this default content. In an ideal situation one would leave as much of the content authored as default content as possible, since this is the natural way for authors to treat documents.In addition to default content, we have a concept of page sections, separated by horizontal rules or --- to group certain elements of a page together. There may be both semantic and design reasons to group content together. A simple case could be that a section of a page has a different background color.In addition to that there is concept of blocks which are authored as a table with a heading as the first row that identifies the type of block. This concept is the easiest approach to componentize your code.
Sections can contain multiple blocks. Blocks should never be nested as it makes things very hard to use for authors.
DOM vs. Markup
AEM produces a clean and easily readable semantic markup from the content that’s provided to it. You can easily access it using the view source feature and have a look at the markup of the page you are currently reading.
The JavaScript library used in scripts.js takes the markup and enhances it into a DOM that is then used for most development tasks, specifically to build blocks. To create a DOM that’s easy to work with for custom project code, it is best to view it as a two-step process.
In the first step, we create the markup with sections, blocks, and default content that will look similar to this.
In the second step, the above mark-up is augmented into the following example DOM, which then can be used for styling and adding functionality. The differences between the markup that’s delivered from the server and the augmented DOM that is used for most of the development tasks is highlighted below.
It primarily consists of introducing a wrapper <div> for blocks and default content and dynamically adding additional helpful CSS classes and data attributes that are used by the AEM block loader.
Sections
Sections are a way to group default content and blocks by the author. Most of the time section breaks are introduced based on visual differences between sections such as a different background color for a part of a page.
From a development perspective, there is usually not much interaction with sections beyond CSS styling.Sections can contain a special block called Section Metadata, which results in data attributes to a section. The names of the data attributes can be chosen by the authors, and the only well-known section metadata property is Style which will be turned into additional CSS classes added to the containing section element.
Blocks and default content are always wrapped in a section, even if the author doesn’t specifically introduce section breaks.
Default Content
There is a broad range of semantics that are shared between Word documents, Google Docs, markdown, and HTML. For example there are headings of different levels (eg. <h1> - <h6>), images, links, lists (<ul>, <ol>), emphasis (<em>, <strong>) etc.
We take advantage of the intuitive understanding that authors have of how to use these semantics in the tools that they are familiar with (eg. Word/Google docs) and maps those to markdown and then renders them in the HTML markup.
All mappings should be relatively straightforward and intuitive for the developer. One area where we go a little bit further than the simplest possible translation is in handling images. Instead of a simple <img> tag, a full <picture> tag is rendered with a number of different resolutions needed for display on desktop and mobile devices as well as different formats for modern browsers that support webp and older browsers which do not.
Blocks
Most of the project-specific CSS and JavaScript lives in blocks. Authors create blocks in their documents and developers write the corresponding code that styles the blocks with CSS and/or decorates the DOM to take the markup of a block and transform it to the structure that’s needed or convenient for desired styling and functionality.
The block name is used as both the folder name of a block as well as the filename for the CSS and JavaScript files that are loaded by the block loader when a block is used on a page. The block name is also used as the CSS class name on the block to allow for intuitive styling.
The JavaScript is loaded as a Module (ESM) and exports a default function that is executed as part of the block loading.
All block level CSS should be scoped to the block to make sure that there are no side-effects for other parts of your project, which means that all selectors in a block should be prefixed with the corresponding block class. In certain cases it makes sense to use the block’s wrapper or containing section for the selector as well.
There is a balance of DOM manipulation in JavaScript and complexity of the CSS selectors. Complex brittle CSS selectors are not recommended and at the same time adding classes to every element makes your code more complex and disregards the semantics of elements.
One of the most important tenets of a project is to keep things simple and intuitive for authors. Complicated blocks make it hard to author content, so it is important that developers absorb the complexity of translating an intuitive authoring experience into the DOM that is needed for layout or application logic. It is often tempting to delegate complexity to the author. Instead, developers should make sure that blocks do not become unwieldy to create for authors. An author should always be able to simply copy/paste a block and intuitively understand what it is about.
A simple example is the Columns Block. It adds additional classes in JavaScript based on how many columns are in the respective instance created by the author. This allows it to be able to use flexible styling of content that is in two columns vs. three columns.
Blocks can be very simple or contain full application components or widgets and provide a way for the developer to componentize their codebase into small chunks of code that can be managed easily and can be loaded on to the web pages as needed.
A block’s content is rendered into the markup as nested <div> tags for the rows and columns that the author entered. In the simplest case, a block has only a single cell.
Authors can add blocks to their pages in an ad-hoc manner by simply adding a table with the block name in the first row or table heading. Some blocks are also loaded automatically. header and footer blocks that need to be present on every page of a site are a good example of that.
Block Options
If you need a block to look or behave slightly differently based on certain circumstances, but not different enough to become a new block in itself, you can let authors add block options to blocks in parentheses. These options add modified classes to the block. For example Columns (wide) in a table header will generate the following markup.
<div class=”columns wide”>
Block options can also contain multiple words. For example Columns (super wide) will be concatenated using hyphens.
<div class=”columns super-wide”>
If block options are comma-separated, such as Columns (dark, wide), they will be added as separate classes.
<div class=”columns dark wide”>
Auto Blocking
In an ideal scenario the majority of content is authored outside of blocks, as introducing tables into a document makes it harder to read and edit. Conversely blocks provide a great mechanism for developers to keep their code organized.
A frequently-used mechanism to get the best of both worlds is called auto blocking. Auto blocking turns default content and metadata into blocks without the author having to physically create them. Auto blocking happens very early in the page decoration process before blocks are loaded and is a practice that programmatically creates the DOM structure of a block as it would come as markup from the server.
Auto blocking is often used in combination with metadata, particularly the template property. If pages have a common template, meaning that they share a certain page design or functionality, that’s usually a good opportunity for auto blocking.
A good example is an article header of a blog post. It might contain information about the author, the title of the blog post, a hero image, as well as the publication date. Instead of having the author put together a block that contains all that information, an auto block (e.g. article-header block) would be programmatically added to the page based on the <h1>, the first image, the blog author, and publication date metadata.
This allows the content author to keep the information in its natural place, the document structure outside of a block. At the same time, the developer can keep all the layout and styling information in a block.
Another very common use case is to wrap blocks around links in a document. A good example is an author linking to a YouTube video by simply including a link, while the developer would like to keep all the code for the video inline embed in an embed block.
This mechanism can also be used as a flexible way to include both external applications and internal references to video, content fragments, modals, forms, and other application elements.
The code for your projects auto blocking lives in buildAutoBlocks() in your scripts.js.
Please see the following examples of auto blocking.

Custom HTTP Response Headers
In some cases, it is useful to apply custom HTTP response headers to resources, for example to allow CORS. If you want to specify headers, create either an Excel Workbook or a Google Sheets Workbook in the /.helix folder of your website in Sharepoint or Google Drive called headers.xlsx in SharePoint or headers in Google Drive.
If your site uses the configuration service, see here for instructions how to apply custom headers.
The workbook should have only one sheet and can define response headers using the url/key/value format as shown below.
The URL column is a glob pattern matching the pages that should have the header should be applied to. A wildcard * can be used as a prefix or suffix, allowing for flexible matches on the URL pathname. Typical examples include /docs/** or **/docs/**.
After you update the sheet, you need to preview (activate) it. Note that the headers are applied to both the preview and live versions of the content. Caches will be purged automatically, so your changes will take effect immediately. See the Admin API documentation for more information.
Note: If the changes apply to code resources, the changes won’t take effect until the code is synced again, either by updating the code in its repository or by manually updating via the Admin API.

Authoring and Publishing Content
Authoring Content
You already know the most important part.
If you use Microsoft Word or Google Docs, then you already know how to create content.
Your documents in Word or Google Docs become your pages on your website. Your headings in your documents will become headings on your website. Bold, italic, underlining, lists, images, etc. will all appear on your website.
Images and Videos
To add an image to your document, drag the image into the page. Word and Google Docs automatically add it as normal. Your image will be resized to fit the browser window of your visitor. Any resizing you do in Word or Google Docs will have no effect.
It is a good idea to set an alternative text for all images you add to the document, as this increases accessibility and helps search engines find your content.
To do this, use the built-in features of both Word and Google Docs. See the documentation of either product for more details.
Microsoft Word: Add alternative text to a shape, picture, chart, SmartArt graphic, or other object
Google Docs: Make your document or presentation more accessible
Word and Google Docs do not allow you to just drag and drop videos, but you can add videos via SharePoint or Google Drive and add the resulting URL as a link to a suitable block in your document.
Links
Links are an important part of every website and you can add them both in Word and Google Docs. If you are creating a link within your website, enter the URL as is, even if the page you are linking to is not public yet (e.g. a preview or live URL).
Links pointing to other pages on the same site will automatically be adjusted to be relative to your site.
You can link to headings or sections within a page by appending an anchor value to the URL. Heading elements have automatic lower-cased IDs where spaces are replaced with dashes. For example, if a page /about-us has a heading “Our History”, the URL linking to it would be https://<your_host>/about-us#our-history.
Sections
On some websites you have sections or blades that change background color or otherwise indicate breaks in the content. Creating a section break in both Microsoft Word and Google Docs can be done using --- (three hyphens) on a single line. In Google Docs you can also create sections by inserting a Horizontal Line element into the page (select “Insert → Horizontal Line” from the menu).
Metadata & SEO
Metadata is information about your page that is invisible to visitors, but important to search engines and social media sites that want to find your content or embed it.
To add metadata to your page, at the end of the document, create a table like the following. Creating a table works almost the same in Word and Google Docs. See the documentation of either product for more details.
Microsoft Word: from the menu, click “Insert → Table” and select the number of columns and rows you want
Google Docs: from the menu, click “Insert → Table” and choose how many rows and columns you want to add
Structure your table like this:
The first row of the table should just contain the word “Metadata”. This tells the system that there is custom metadata for your document.
Then create one row for each metadata property. The left column contains the name of the metadata property, the right column the value. In most cases, values are plain text, but as you can see from the “image” row, sometimes other content can be used, too.
You’ve just created a metadata block. You can also create metadata for many pages at once. See the document Bulk Metadata for more information.
Special Metadata Properties
In addition to all well-known metadata properties, AEM also supports the following properties with special handling:
canonical
The canonical property will be used as the canonical URL in the following tags:
<link rel=”canonical”>
<meta property="og:url">
<meta name="twitter:url">
If not specified, AEM will generate the canonical URL automatically using the configured production domain.
canonical:extension
The canonical:extension property allows you to define the file extension for canonical URLs. This is useful for ensuring consistent and SEO-friendly canonical URLs across your site, even if the actual file paths do not include the extension.
To avoid having to repeat it for many documents, this property is best used in the bulk metadata sheet by adding a column named canonical:extension. For example, to give an .html extension to all canonical URLs on your site, add an entry like this:
description
The description property will will appear as is, but also be used in the following tags:
<meta property="og:description">
<meta name="twitter:description">
If not specified, AEM will use the first text paragraph with 10 words or more found on the page.
image
The image property will be used for the image URL in the following tags:
<meta property="og:image">
<meta property="og:image:secure_url">
`<meta name="twitter:image">
If not specified, AEM will use the first image found on the page. If the page does not contain any images, the default value will be set to /default-meta-image.png. You can add this file via SharePoint, Google Drive, or GitHub, for example.
title
The title property will be used in the following tags:
<meta property="og:title">
<meta name="twitter:title">
<title></title>
If not specified, AEM will use the first Heading 1 (h1) found on the page.
title:suffix
The title:suffix property enables you to automatically append a specified suffix to the title property of your pages. This is useful to apply branding, to add consistent information, or to meet specific SEO requirements across a set of pages.
To avoid having to repeat it for many documents, this property is best used in the bulk metadata sheet by adding a column named title:suffix. For instance, to append | Adobe to the end of all page titles, add an entry like this:
Note: AEM will always insert a space between the title and the suffix.
tags
The tags property can be used to provide a list of tags, separated by commas or as a bullet list. Each tag will be rendered like this:
<meta property="article:tag">
json-ld
The json-ld property can be used to add a JSON schema rendered like this:
<script type=”application/ld+json”>
Note: consider other methods like client-side JavaScript or head.html to add a JSON schema to your page. In many cases, metadata is not the right approach.
Omitting Metadata Values
If you want to remove a metadata value, you can simply leave its value empty.
Blocks
Blocks are a way to work with more structured content and add special functionality to your site. Which blocks are available to your site depends on what your development team has implemented and differs from site to site. The only block that is common to all sites is the metadata block described previously.
Regardless of site, the structure of a block is always the same: it is a table with a merged first row that serves as the block name (header row). The header row may have specific formatting like a background color to increase their discoverability and differentiation in a document.
Blocks usually contain content, configuration, or references to other pieces of content, be it from other documents, spreadsheets, or both.
As you can see from this example, you are free to put any kind of content into the cells of a block, and it is up to the block to either render the content or ignore it. If the site you are working on uses blocks extensively, then you will probably have a reference list of blocks you can use.
Blocks can have variants in parenthesis. For example, a Columns block can have a (highlight)option which passes a layout hint to the block display logic.
See the document The Block Collection to learn more about out-of-the-box blocks.
Structured Data in Spreadsheets
You can put content into spreadsheets and then the spreadsheet is automatically turned into an API that your developers can use. This allows you to use spreadsheets like a headless CMS for use in data tables, navigation, or feature comparisons, for example.
See the document Spreadsheets and JSON for more information.
Preview and Publish Content
Once a document is created in Google Drive or Sharepoint, you can preview the corresponding web page and eventually publish the content to your production website.
The preview function is used to share pages with stakeholders before they are published and available to the general public on your website.
In order to preview, publish, or delete content, use the Sidekick that can be installed as a browser extension.
Preview
In Word or Google Docs, open the Sidekick, then click the “Preview” button. This will open a new browser window (check for the popup warning) that has the preview version of your site.
Although you can copy and share the URL of this preview, it is not meant for production. It does not have your domain name on it and is invisible to search engines. If the content is ready for publication, you can publish. If you need to make changes, open the Sidekick on the preview page and click “Edit” to go back to Word or Google Docs.
Publish
Publishing makes your content visible to everyone on the internet. To publish something, open the sidekick on a preview page (or follow the instructions above to open the preview again), then click “Publish”. After a few seconds, a new browser window will open, with your page on your public website.
Once your content has been published, it is visible to everyone on the internet, and search engines will be able to find it.
Delete
Generally, deleting published content and therefore removing publicly accessible resources from the web can be problematic because of inbound links from search, social, bookmarks and other referring sites. If a page is deleted that was once published, it is recommended to use redirects to make sure that incoming traffic for the deleted page is sent to the next best place. See the document Redirects for more information.
If you want to remove published content or just delete it from your site as part of a clean-up, doing so is a two-step process.
First, delete the source document from Sharepoint or Google Drive.
Alternatively you can rename the page or move it to a different folder, for example your drafts folder.
Alternatively you can rename the page or move it to a different folder, for example your drafts folder.
Then open the page you want to delete on the preview site and open the sidekick. There will be two options: Delete and Unpublish.
Unpublish removes it from the public production website, but keeps the preview.
Delete removes the preview, too.
Unpublish removes it from the public production website, but keeps the preview.
Delete removes the preview, too.
Deleting or unpublishing something is permanent and cannot be easily undone. If you want to undo a deletion, you have to restore the original document in Sharepoint or Google Drive and then publish it again.

http://www.aem.live/docs/bulk-metadata

Bulk Metadata
By default, metadata is managed at the page level. See Authoring and Publishing Content for more information.
In some cases, it is useful to apply metadata en masse to a website. Common use cases include:
A certain section of a website should look and feel different from the rest of the website (such as a different template or a different theme).
Default metadata such an og:image should be applied to portions of the website.
If a certain portion of the website should not be indexed by robots, the metadata can be used to set the robots meta tag to noindex for a portion of the site.
If you want to create metadata for many pages at once, create a metadata sheet in the root folder of your website content.
Name the file metadata in Google Drive or AEM.
Name the file metadata.xlsx in SharePoint.
The workbook should have only one sheet and at least two columns as in the following image.
The column titled URL has the URL pattern of the pages that should get a particular metadata entry.
The wildcard * (the asterisk) can be used as a prefix or suffix, allowing for flexible matches on the URL pathname. Typical examples include /docs/** or **/docs/**.
The metadata sheet is evaluated from top to bottom, site wide meta data set to ** must be before more specific entries.
For each metadata property, create a column in the worksheet and name it using the property you want to assign. Typical examples include template, theme, or robots.
Page-level metadata added via a metadata block takes precedence over bulk metadata. See Authoring and Publishing Content and Metadata (block) for more information.
Note: You need to preview and publish the metadata sheet in order to see changes reflected on your site.
Special Metadata Properties
In addition to all well-known metadata properties, AEM also supports the following properties with special handling:
canonical
The canonical property will be used as the canonical URL in the following tags:
<link rel=”canonical”>
<meta property="og:url">
<meta name="twitter:url">
If not specified, AEM will generate the canonical URL automatically using the configured production domain.
canonical:extension
The canonical:extension property allows you to define the file extension for canonical URLs. This is useful for ensuring consistent and SEO-friendly canonical URLs across your site, even if the actual file paths do not include the extension.
To avoid having to repeat it for many documents, this property is best used in the bulk metadata sheet by adding a column named canonical:extension. For example, to give an .html extension to all canonical URLs on your site, add an entry like this:
description
The description property will will appear as is, but also be used in the following tags:
<meta property="og:description">
<meta name="twitter:description">
If not specified, AEM will use the first text paragraph with 10 words or more found on the page.
image
The image property will be used for the image URL in the following tags:
<meta property="og:image">
<meta property="og:image:secure_url">
`<meta name="twitter:image">
If not specified, AEM will use the first image found on the page. If the page does not contain any images, the default value will be set to /default-meta-image.png. You can add this file via SharePoint, Google Drive, or GitHub, for example.
title
The title property will be used in the following tags:
<meta property="og:title">
<meta name="twitter:title">
<title></title>
If not specified, AEM will use the first Heading 1 (h1) found on the page.
title:suffix
The title:suffix property enables you to automatically append a specified suffix to the title property of your pages. This is useful to apply branding, to add consistent information, or to meet specific SEO requirements across a set of pages.
To avoid having to repeat it for many documents, this property is best used in the bulk metadata sheet by adding a column named title:suffix. For instance, to append | Adobe to the end of all page titles, add an entry like this:
Note: AEM will always insert a space between the title and the suffix.
tags
The tags property can be used to provide a list of tags, separated by commas or as a bullet list. Each tag will be rendered like this:
<meta property="article:tag">
json-ld
The json-ld property can be used to add a JSON schema rendered like this:
<script type=”application/ld+json”>
Note: consider other methods like client-side JavaScript or head.html to add a JSON schema to your page. In many cases, metadata is not the right approach.
Omitting Metadata Values
To explicitly remove metadata a "" can be used as a value. This will remove the element or set the corresponding attribute to "" for a particular path.
Example:
The example above will remove the <link rel="canonical"> from all pages by default, unless there is a specific override for example from a page metadata block.
Additional Metadata
When having metadata that is managed by several teams it is not practical to keep them all in the same metadata files. Multi metadata support is possible by configuring the all the metadata files that need to be taken into account in the /.helix/config.xlsx file:
The order of the entries in the list dictates the order of how the data is applied. The final order of the metadata is as follows:
If there is metadata configured in the /.helix/config.xlsx:
Page level metadata block wins over
Folder-mapped metadata sheet wins over
Metadata sheet(s) in configured order
if there is no configured order:
Page level metadata block wins over
Folder-mapped metadata sheet wins over
Bulk metadata sheet (/metadata.xlsx)
Note that individual metadata properties are overwritten but never deleted. For example, if the /metadata.json defines a property title, the same property in /metadata-2nd.json will overwrite the value, but only if it is not empty.

http://www.aem.live/docs/placeholders

Placeholders
In most websites, there are strings or variables that will be used throughout the site. Especially in sites that need to support multiple languages, it is not a good idea to hard code such values. Instead placeholders can be used and managed centrally.
Note: depending on your site content structure, placeholders might not be in use.
Placeholders can be managed as a spreadsheet that is either in the root folder of the project or in the locales root folder in the case of a multilingual site.
Name the file placeholders for Google Docs.
Name the file placeholders.xlsx for SharePoint.
The spreadsheet has to contain at least two columns titled Key and Text.
The Key column is an identifier that is transformed automatically to be easily accessible via code.
The Text is the literal text (or string) for a placeholder with a given key.
After making changes to your placeholder spreadsheet, you can preview your changes via the sidekick and have your stakeholders check that the new placeholders are working on your .page preview website before publishing the placeholder changes to your production website. See the Sidekick documentation for more information about switching between environments.
Are you a developer and curious to learn how to use placeholders in your code? Look here.

http://www.aem.live/developer/sitemap

Sitemaps
Create automatically generated sitemap files to be referenced from your robots.txt. This helps with SEO and the discovery of new content. AEM can generate three types of sitemaps: without any configuration, based solely on a query index or based on a manual sitemap configuration. A single sitemap must be limited to 50,000 URLs and 50MB (uncompressed) in size - see Limits.
Creating a Sitemap without any configuration
If you don’t do anything you will see your sitemap in sitemap.xml and have a sitemap index in sitemap.json. It will contain a list of all your published documents.
If you started with another type of sitemap and would like to switch to this type, you’ll have to delete the helix-sitemap.yaml configuration file - either manually defined in GitHub or automatically generated - and reindex your site.
Domain name used in external URLs
To customize the domain used in creating external URLs, add a property named cdn.prod.host in your project configuration.
If you are using the configuration service, see here how to update the site configuration.
Otherwise, see here for document-based configuration.
Generating a Sitemap configuration based on an index
Please see the document Indexing to learn more about indexing. In order to generate a sitemap configuration based on an index, please ensure that you have already set up an initial query index as explained there. This will generate a sitemap at the location:
https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/sitemap.xml
And a sitemap configuration at the following location:
https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/helix-sitemap.yaml
It is recommended that you create a sitemap-index.xml file that references all your sitemaps and keep that as part of your project code in your github repo. This way it is easy to add new sitemaps as the project expands.
Manual setup of your Sitemap configuration
If you need more customization than your generated sitemap configuration file provides, you can copy its contents and paste it into a file named helix-sitemap.yaml in the root folder of your project.
Alternatively, if you are using the configuration service, you can also update the sitemap.yaml via the site configuration.
Note: When using a manually configured index and sitemap (e.g. your code repo includes a helix-query.yaml and helix-sitemap.yaml file) your index definition must include the robots property to ensure the sitemap excludes pages with robots: noindex metadata. When using auto-generated index definitions, simply follow the recommendations in the indexing documentation so those pages are excluded from the index.
The following sections contain the supported types of sitemaps.
Simple Sitemap
The following is a simple helix-sitemap.yaml. It assumes a single index containing all the pages that need to appear in the sitemap.
If you want last modification dates to be included in the URLs of your sitemap, add a lastmod property including a format to your configuration.
Multiple Sitemaps
It is common to have sitemaps per section of the sites and/or per country or language. AEM supports sitemaps including the corresponding hreflang references. In the following example we assume that there is a one to one mapping between the indexes and the sitemaps XML files.
If there are two pages in the english and french section that share a common suffix, they will be related, so e.g. if you have a page /welcome in the english section and a page /fr/welcome in the french section, the resulting entry in the /sitemap-en.xml will look like this:
A similar entry will be available in /sitemap-fr.xml.
Specifying the primary language manually
There might be situations where you have alternate versions of a page, but you’re unable to use a common suffix to identify them, possibly because you’re porting a legacy website that should not have its paths changed. In that situation, you can specify a primary-language-url for the alternate location, in the metadata of the document.
Let’s assume our primary language is english, we have a page /welcome in the english section and /fr/bienvenu in the french section, and the latter is an alternate version of the former.
First, we add that information to the document at /fr/bienvenu in its metadata:
This can also be added to a global metadata sheet, as shown in Bulk Metadata.
Then, we add an indexed property primary-language-url to the french index:
Finally, we re-publish the french page, and rebuild the sitemap.
Specifying the default language
Another common requirement is to specify the default language for a sitemap with multiple languages. This can be achieved by adding a property default in the sitemap:
In the resulting sitemap, all entries from the english subtree will have an extra alternate entry with hreflang x-default.
Specifying multiple hreflangs for one subtree
Sometimes, it is required to map multiple hreflangs to only one language subtree, e.g. consider we want the following to appear in the resulting sitemap:
Every page in our sitemap source should appear exactly once, but have multiple alternate hreflangs associated with it. In order to achieve this, you should specify an array of languages in the hreflang property:
Multiple Indexes Aggregated Into One Sitemap
There are cases where it is easier to have a single larger sitemap than fragmented small sitemaps, especially as there is a limit of sitemaps that can be submitted to search engines per site.
The following example shows how to aggregate a number of separate indexes into a single sitemap.
Using the same destination it is possible to combine multiple small sitemaps into one larger sitemap.
Including other sitemaps as input
In a mixed scenario, where not all languages in a sitemap are managed in AEM, you can include sitemaps from other language trees by specifying an XML path as source, as in:
In this example, we use an external french sitemap to calculate all sitemap locations. AEM will determine alternates for english sitemap URLs by deconstructing the french counterparts in external sitemap using the alternate definition.
Adding an extension to all locations in the sitemap
In a scenario, where you want all your locations to have an extension, e.g. .html, and you’re unable to generate a helix-sitemap sheet in your query index to derive a formula, you can add an extension to all languages or an individual language using an extension property:

http://www.aem.live/docs/setup-customer-sharepoint

How to use Sharepoint (application)
NOTE: for projects using Adobe’s Sharepoint please continue here.
If you use SharePoint as your content source, AEM uses a registered Microsoft Azure application to access your content. This application has delegated permissions defined that allow the service to access SharePoint on behalf of a user. This user needs to be registered to the project that is using SharePoint.
Alternatively, the services can also authenticate as an application and use application permissions to access the sites. This needs additional setup by a SharePoint site administrator that can grant the permissions for the application.
The preferred setup is to use application permissions, as this narrows down the access the service has to a specific SharePoint site and does not require to share any secrets of a technical user. Also, it reduces the problems around password rotation.
The following describes how to set up application permissions for your project. If you want to set up a technical user, please continue here.
Setting up SharePoint involves the following steps:
Create or identify a Sharepoint site that will serve as site for the document based authoring
Create a folder within SharePoint that will be the website root.
Set the content source in your site configuration
Access the Registration Portal
Register the Application
Apply the sites.selected permission to the SharePoint site
1. Create or identify a Sharepoint site
Talk to your IT department to either identify or create a Sharepoint site that will be used for document based authoring. One site can “host” multiple websites (projects). This site will later receive the respective permissions so that the publishing services can access it.
2. Create the website root folder
Navigate to your desired location in the SharePoint site created or identified above and create a root folder that will be your website root. It is best to not use a SharePoint list root directly, so that you have a shared space for your authors to put collateral documents, for example a drafts folder, or how-to-author documentations.
An example file structure might look like this, using the website folder as the root:
3. Set the content source in your site configuration
The next step is to set the source property in your site configuration to the corresponding Sharepoint URL(see: https://www.aem.live/docs/admin.html#schema/SiteConfig for more detail)The expected format usually looks like the example below.
This might vary depending on how you create the SharePoint site and lists. In order to obtain the url, the simplest way is to copy-past the first part from the browser address, eg:
And then add the rest manually (Note, that copying the sharelink via the UI adds unnecessary information and it is better to use a canonical representation of the url). Once you compose the url, you can test it by entering it again in the browser. You should end up in the folder view of your website root.
After that, update the source in your site config service via the API accordingly.
An easy way to make this change is to use https://labs.aem.live/tools/site-admin/index.html to either create or update a site configuration.
For example:
Hit save to persist the change.
4. Access the Registration Portal
Overview
In order for the AEM service to access the authored content it needs a couple of information and setup. The AEM service (a cloud function) accesses the MS Graph API on behalf of an application (or configured user). In order to do so, it needs to authenticate first in the context of an Application. This is important because the scopes given to the application define what permission the service has on the MS Graph API. For example, it should be allowed to read and write documents, but not to alter access control.
An application is represented as an “Enterprise Application” in the respective Active Directory of a tenant. The permissions given to that enterprise application ultimately define what the service can access in that tenant’s resources. Certain permissions need to be approved by an Active Directory administrator before a user can use the application. This so-called “admin consent” is a mechanism to verify and control which permissions apps can have. This is to prevent dubious apps from tricking users into trusting an app that is not official. Having the extra admin consent step allows IT security to control which apps the employees can use.

Go to https://admin.hlx.page/register, enter the github url of the project or the org/site values of your site config.
Sign-in as non admin user
Sign in as a user that does not have admin permissions will show an error that it needs approval, i.e. the application needs admin consent.
Problem: Enterprise Application is not registered if a user never logs in.
Sign-in as admin user
One solution is to sign in as a user that does have admin permissions:
(note, at this point the Enterprise Application is still not registered in azure)
AEM Content Integration Registration visible in UI
If the admin logs in (without checking the checkbox and granting consent for everyone), the Enterprise application is present.
Create application using MSGraph or Powershell
Alternatively, you can create the Enterprise application via MSGraph or Powershell.
In order to make it visible in the azure UI you also need to add the WindowsAzureActiveDirectoryIntegratedApp tag. This can be done directly when creating the application.Using graph explorer:
Using powershell:
After that you still need to give admin consent, if you want a non admin user to login.

Review permissions
Note that the AEM Content Integration Registration (e34c45c4-0919-43e1-9436-448ad8e81552) application is only needed during registration to verify that the user has read access to the sharepoint. It has the following delegated permissions:
OpenidAllows users to sign in to the app with their work or school accounts and allows the app to see basic user profile information.
ProfileAllows the app to see your users' basic profile (e.g., name, picture, user name, email address)
Files.ReadWrite.AllAllows the app to read, create, update and delete all files the signed-in user can access.
User logged in Registration portal
After completing this initial step, the user is logged in the registration portal
Verify write access to the content source via challenge file
Download the challenge file
Before you can register (or change) the registration. You have to prove that you have write access to the respective sharepoint location. For that you need to upload a text file containing the mentioned content. This can easily be done by downloading the file and drop it into the sharepoint folder.
After that, click on Validate to continue the registration.
Adding the AEM Content Integration App with application permissions
Add Enterprise Application
When logged in the registration portal, the content source that is used by the project needs to be connected to an oauth grant for the AEM Content Integration application. This is needed, so that the system can access the documents in sharepoint and convert them to an internal format (markdown) and store it in Adobe’s storage (S3/R2) for fast delivery.
Using application sites.selected permissions is more secure as it limits the scope to a single sharepoint site. In order to connect, click on the Connect Application button.
If you never registered an application or a user before, you probably see the following error:
or
Same as above, the Enterprise application for the AEM Content Integration (83ab2922-5f11-4e4d-96f3-d1e0ff152856) is not present in Azure yet,In order to add it, use the graph explorer or powershell to add it:
Using graph explorer:
Using powershell:
Also see:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/create-service-principal-cross-tenant
Add Application Roles
Now the enterprise application AEM Content Integration is visible in azure. But it doesn’t have any Sites.Selected application permissions.
Problem: Using the admin consent UI would grant all application and delegated permissions, which we don’t want.
An easy way is to consent to all permissions and then remove the delegated ones again.
Add Application Roles using Powershell or Graph Explorer
Alternatively, adding the app roles can be done with the following steps:
Find the service principal of the enterprise application (principalId). This is the one you created above.
Find the service principal of the Microsoft Graph API (resourceId)
Find the Id for the Sites.Selected Application Role (appRoleId)
Assign the Application Role to the Managed Identity (The Enterprise Application)
Using powershell this can be done with:
Using graph explorer it involves more steps:
Find the principal of the enterprise application for AEM Content Integration :
This will be our principalId
Find the service principal of the Microsoft Graph API
This is the resourceId. (the resource that defines the application role)
Find the id of the application role.GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals/${resourceId}/appRoles
Substitute the resourceId with the service principal of the Microsoft Graph API as obtained from the previous step.
Find the entry for Sites.Selected. This Id is the appRoleId
Assign the Application Role to the Managed Identity. The request has the format:
For example:
Validate Permissions
Eventually you should see the granted application permission in the UI.
Back in the registration portal, they should have changed to:
The content source can't be found or you don't have permission to access it. Please check that the URL is correct, the app "AEM Content Integration (83ab2922-5f11-4e4d-96f3-d1e0ff152856)" has the right permissions, and that the user is allowed to access it..
Add permissions to Sharepoint Site
In order to add the permissions to the sharepoint site, we need to find its SiteId.
This can be done using again the graph explorer:
Example:
Using the Id we can set the permissions:
Note: If you get an “Access Denied” error while executing the above request , you need to have “Site Admin” permissions in order to run the above step. Also you may need to give additional “consent” from the Graph Explorer’s “Modify Permissions” panel for additional “Sites” scopes.
After that, the registration portal should show

http://www.aem.live/docs/go-live-checklist

Go-Live Checklist
The go-live checklist is a summary of best practices to consider when launching a website. These steps are generally good practices but have some aspects specific to Adobe Experience Manager.
Steps Before Go-Live
Content and Design QA
Make sure that your content and design conforms to the specifications and that you are happy with the website you see on your projects .aem.live domain. This may include checks for specific accessibility and SEO requirements of your project.
Performance Validation
Every AEM project should produce a lighthouse score of 100 for mobile and desktop from Google Pagespeed insights on its respective .aem.live site.
See the document Keeping it 100, Web Performance for more information.
Analytics Validation
Make sure that all your analytics setup and the rest of your martech stack is firing as expected and visitor data is visible in your reporting dashboards.In any relaunch of a website the analytics instrumentation will change based on loading sequence and performance.
It is important to expect that the baseline of any metric captured by analytics will change. Contact the corresponding analysts to make sure that the adjustment of the baseline is understood and expected.
Metrics that may change their baselines as reported by analytics may include pageviews, conversion rates, bounce rates, time on page, etc. Depending on the change in loading patterns the baseline of the metrics may go up and down.Bottom of the funnel metrics like checkout, transactions or form submission that are captured by operational systems are not affected and are expected to stay flat past a lift-and-shift launch.
RUM instrumentation
To be able to see performance impact quickly and reliably and to compare before / after launch metrics we recommend instrumenting your website before launch with Real Use Monitoring (RUM), ideally as early as possible. Adding RUM to your existing site is trivial and can give you important operational insights even before launch.
Legacy Redirects
In most migrations there are legacy URLs that are retired. Make sure those are reflected in your redirects spreadsheet (redirects.xlsx in sharepoint or redirects in google), found in your project content folder. Check Google Search Console for the most impactful backlinks (in terms of SEO) to create redirects for.
See the document Redirects for more information.
Sitemap & Robots
For most websites with a significant number of pages, a sitemap is desirable. AEM automatically generates sitemaps from the query index. For multilingual sites, adding hreflang to the sitemap ensures that the website correctly targets the appropriate geographic and language audience, which is essential for SEO and prevents issues like duplicate content across different language versions (aka SEO cannibalisation) and improves the search engine's ability to serve the right version of the content to the right users.
If you have a sitemap that’s generated for your site make sure it is discoverable from your robots.txt. ​​Note that robots.txt is (technically) case sensitive, and a good example is:
Note: aem.page and aem.live are kept hidden from crawlers intentionally, to avoid duplicate content. There is no need to set the robots.txt to Disallow crawlers during development.
It is important to understand that a Disallow in robots.txt is potentially helping with crawler budget issues under certain conditions, but does not prevent a page from being added to the google index, and conversely will make its removal via noindex impossible. URLs of pages that have a Disallow can still be discovered in a SERP.
An effective way to remove a URL from the index is to Allow crawlers and put a noindex robots tag on the page.
Adding a custom robots.txt is done via config service.
See the documents Indexing and Sitemaps for more information.
Canonical URLs
Make sure canonical URLs return 2xx HTML response status code (not 3xx or 4xx) and that they are correctly implemented, which is crucial for preventing duplicate content issues across the site. Proper canonicalization helps search engines understand which versions of similar pages to index and display in search results, directly impacting SEO performance.
See the following external documentation for more information: Consolidate duplicate urls
Favicon
Adding a favicon to your site gives it a professional look in your visitor’s browsers.
See the document Favicon for more information.
Authentication for Authors
By default, authors don’t need to be logged in to use AEM Sidekick. If you decide you want to control who can preview and publish documents this can be configured.
See the document Configuring Authentication for Authors for more information.
SharePoint Access
If your content is in SharePoint, follow this guide to configure dedicated access which you control.
CDN Configuration
One of the last steps in a go-live is usually to update your CDN to point to your aem.live endpoint.
You can either use your existing, self-managed CDN or an Adobe-managed CDN included in your license. See here for details on supported CDN options.
Ideally the CDN configuration is tested in a staging environment to make sure everything works as expected, which includes redirects from www to APEX and vice-versa.
Push Invalidation Setup
Make sure push invalidation is properly set up according to the document Configuring Push Invalidation for BYO Production CDN. Test the setup by publishing a small change and verifying that the change is visible on the production domain.
Notify Engineering On-Call
Notifying the Edge Delivery Services team about your upcoming go-live helps our on-call engineers proactively monitor logs during the event and quickly reach out if any issues arise that we can assist with.
To notify the team, please send an email to aemgolives@adobe.com and include the following information:
Top-level URL(s) that will be going live on Edge Delivery Services
Planned go-live date and time
Primary contact person for the go-live
Teams or Slack channel for real-time collaboration with Engineering
If you do not yet have a collaboration channel set up, please refer to Teams Collaboration for guidance.
If you do not yet have a collaboration channel set up, please refer to Teams Collaboration for guidance.
Post Go-Live Validation
Performance Validation
Validate that the performance is still at a lighthouse score of 100 via pagespeed insights on the production environment. Introducing a CDN layer can have adverse performance effects that are usually visible on the protocol layer. Typical culprits are running HTTP/1.1 or ineffective origin caching as well as bot detection or other libraries injected by the CDN configuration.
Google Search Console
If you have an active Google Search Console with your sitemap uploaded, it may be valuable to get a coverage report and make sure that indexing works as expected. The Google Search Console should be monitored for the weeks after a go-live to track the indexing status of new and updated pages, ensuring they are properly recognized by Google. It's crucial to check for total clicks, total impressions, backlinks changes and crawl errors, as these can significantly impact the site's SEO performance and authority.
Martech and Analytics validation
Certain aspects of your martech stack may be tied to specific origins / hostnames, and operate differently on staging (or .page and .live) hostnames if not configured correctly. It is advisable to make sure that all the important tags in the martech stack fire correctly and the information is continuously collected after a go-live.
404 Report
After a website has been migrated there is usually a set of 404 Not Founds, which should be monitored after the go-live and redirected to popular page URLs. This information can be pulled from your site analytics and the respective Slack bot report. Monitoring this for the weeks after a go-live is recommended.

Configuring push invalidation for BYO production CDN
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes or a developer pushes code changes to the main branch (changes on other branches do not trigger push invalidation).
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Setting up push invalidation requires 2 steps:
Configuration
Opt-In Request Header
Configuration
Push invalidation is currently supported for CDNs of the following vendors:
Fastly
Akamai
Cloudflare
CloudFront
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
The following sections describe the vendor specific properties required to set up push invalidation.
Fastly
Configuration properties:
Create a Fastly API Token
go to Personal API Tokens,
click on "Create Token",
enter a name (e.g. "Production Site Purge Token"),
select "A specific service" and your production service from the drop-down list,
check the "Purge select content (purge_select) — Purge by URL or surrogate key" check box,
select "Never expire",
click on "Create Token",
copy the generated token value shown in the pop-up window.
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
Akamai
Configuration properties
Push invalidation uses the Akamai Fast Purge API, specifically Delete by URL and Delete by cache tag.
The Fast Purge API credentials consist of

http://www.aem.live/docs/byo-cdn-cloudflare-worker-setup

Cloudflare Setup
The following screenshots illustrate how to configure Cloudflare to deliver content. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
This setup can be completely done in the browser by using the Cloudflare Dashboard only. If you are already familiar with Cloudflare Workers, Wrangler & GitHub and not afraid of entering commands in a terminal window you might want to follow the instructions for Cloudflare with wrangler instead.
Create a Cloudflare site
If you already have a Cloudflare site and DNS set up you can skip forward to the Setup push invalidation section.
Enter the domain:
Select a plan:
For this walk-through we’ll use the Free plan.
Setup push invalidation for Cloudflare
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is configured by adding specific properties to the project's configuration:
If you are using the configuration service, see here how to update the CDN configuration.
Otherwise, see here for document-based CDN configuration.
Configuration properties:
values: free, pro, business, enterprise
default: free
To create an API Token,
go to API Tokens
click on "Create Token",
go to "Create Custom Token" at the bottom and click on "Get started"
enter a token name (e.g. "Production Site Purge Token"),
Permissions: "Zone", "Cache Purge", "Purge"
Zone Resources: "Include", "Specific zone", "<your production zone>"
click on "Continue to summary"
click on "Create Token",
copy the generated token value.
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
DNS Setup
For a new site, we’ll start with a simple DNS setup.
Create a new CNAME record. If your zone is mysite.com and you want to serve traffic on www.mysite.com, then the name should be www
If you want to serve traffic on example.com (without a www) then the name should be @
And if you want to serve traffic on all subdomains, then the name should be *
As we are using workers to serve the content, the value of the Content field does not matter. It’s easiest to use your ref--repo--owner.aem.live host name here. This is a hostname, not a URL, so leave out the leading https://
Make sure the CNAME record is Proxied:
SSL/TLS Setup
Select SSL/TLS from the left pane and Edge Certificates in the dropdown list. On the right side, scroll down to Always Use HTTPS and enable the setting:
Configure Caching
Navigate to Caching → Configuration and adjust following settings:
Caching Level: Standard
Browser Cache TTL: Respect Existing Headers
Create Cache Rules
Next browse to Caching → Cache Rules and create a new cache rule
Note: Enable Origin Cache Control option is only available for enterprise accounts. Free, Pro, and Business customers have this option enabled by default and cannot disable it.
Following settings should apply:
When incoming requests match: hostname contains mydomain.com
Then: Eligible for cache
Under Browser TTL, click "add setting", then apply "Respect Origin TTL"
Create Worker
Return to the Cloudflare Dashboard homepage, then navigate the sidebar: Workers & Pages → Overview. Click "create" to create a new worker.
On the next screen, click "create worker", because that's what you want to achieve.
Enter a name for the worker (e.g. aem-worker) and click on “Deploy”:
On the next screen, click "Edit code"
Edit worker code
Copy the content of this file.
In the left pane, replace the existing content with the copied content.
Click on “Deploy”
Confirm with "Save and Deploy"
Note: If you are using the recommended content-security-policy with ‘strict-dynamic’ and (cached) nonce , please make sure to use the latest worker code, which removes the header in 304 responses, to ensure that there is no mismatch between the nonce cached in your site user’s browser and the one returned by the server.
Return to your worker (by clicking the back arrow in the top right corner), then click on Settings → Variables and “Add variable”:Add a variable ORIGIN_HOSTNAME and set the value to the hostname of your origin (e.g. main--mysite--aemsites.aem.live):
If you have enabled push invalidation, add a second environment variable PUSH_INVALIDATION = enabled.
Apply the changes by clicking "Deploy".
Next, click on Triggers an select “Add route”:
Enter your domain route (e.g. www.mydomain.com/*), select your zone and confirm with “Add route”:
Depending on the setup chosen in DNS Setup, you would select routes www.mydomain.com/* or mydomain.com/*
Warning: if you select *.mydomain.com/* as Cloudflare suggests in the field default, your site will be available under multiple subdomains. This will invite attackers trying to open webmail.mydomain.com and similar sites, and lead to duplicate content, potentially depressing your search engine rankings.After completing all steps you should be all set.
Optional: Authenticate Origin Requests
When using token-based Site Authentication, add the following to enable authenticated requests from Cloudflare to AEM.
Return to Workers → <your worker> → Settings → Variables
Create a new environment variable ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION
Paste the site token value from token-based Site Authentication (it starts with hlx_)
Confirm by clicking "Deploy"
Expanding the AEM footprint on your website
In case you start with having only a portion of the website being routed to your .live origin and have routed a specific folder (eg. /blog/*) you can subsequently add more routes whenever you are ready to expose new sections of the site by simply adding more routes and repeat the last “add route” steps as needed, without changing your worker configuration.
Watch out for duplicate content
Search engines often penalize sites for duplicate content, so it's important to make sure your content is not available on the web elsewhere. Cloudflare, unfortunately, has a default setting that will expose your site on additional network ports. In paid Cloudflare plans you can block traffic on these additional ports. This is a recommended setting for production sites.

Configuration properties:
This setting will ensure that Akamai authenticates requests from your CDN to the AEM Origin, which validates the token received in the Authorization header.
Caveats
Do not enable Akamai mPulse Real Usage Monitoring. While the performance impact on most sites is negligible, for sites built for consistent high performance, enabling it will prevent reaching a Lighthouse Score of 100. In AEM, you have a Real Use Monitoring service built-in, so that dual instrumentation will be unnecessary and is strongly discouraged.
Also, do not enable Akamai Bot Manager Premier (also called “Transactional Endpoint Protection”) or similar Web Application Firewall offerings, as they markedly interfere with rendering performance and user experience. Your site on AEM is protected against bot attacks on the backend, so that this performance cost comes with negligible benefit.
Setup push invalidation for Akamai
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).

Special Mention - Akamai Edge-Control Headers
AEM uses a fine tuned, production hardened way to supply caching information that applies to the specific CDN, in conjunction with our reliable push invalidation. This allows us to improve cache efficiency and consistency over traditional TTL based approaches.
Every CDN vendor supports a way to directly influence how to instruct caching and we are excited to see standardization efforts like "Targeted Cache Control" (TCC) being on the roadmap for Akamai (see: https://www.akamai.com/blog/news/targeted-cache-control), in the meantime we are using Akamai's long-term supported Edge-Control header.

go to Personal API Tokens,
click on "Create Token",
enter a name (e.g. "Production Site Purge Token"),
select "A specific service" and your production service from the drop-down list,
check the "Purge select content (purge_select) — Purge by URL or surrogate key" check box,
select "Never expire",
click on "Create Token",
copy the generated token value shown in the pop-up window.
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
Create a Fastly service
Go to the Fastly Management UI and select Create Service, CDN.
Add Domain
Add your production domain (e.g. www.mydomain.com):
Configure Origin
Add your origin (e.g. main--mysite--hlxsites.aem.live) and keep the default settings for:
Override default host
Default compression
Force TLS & HSTS
In the new configuration, click "Edit configuration" in the top right corner and "clone version 1 to edit".
In the sidebar, select "Hosts" underneath "Origins" and click the pencil icon to change host settings.
Scroll down and change Shielding to Ashburn Metro (IAD) (non-mandatory but recommended setting):

Create additional VCL snippets for the miss and pass subroutines with the following VCL code:
Note: The X-Push-Invalidation: enabled request header enables the push invalidation including long cache TTLs.
Create a deliver snippet with the following VCL code:
Finally create a deliver snippet with the following VCL code:
After completing all steps and activating the service version you should be all set:
Optional: Authenticate Origin Requests
If you have enabled token-based Site Authentication, navigate in the sidebar to Content → Headers, then "create a header" with following settings:
Name: Origin Authentication
Type: Request/Set
Destination: http.Authorization
Source: "token <your-token-here>" (don't forget the quotes, and replace <your-token-here> with the site token retrieved in token-based Site Authentication – the token starts with hlx_)
Ignore if set: no
Priority: 10
Note
Your Fastly setup should not use Fastly’s Next Generation Web Application Firewall for requests that are going against aem.live or any other Edge Delivery Services origin. Enabling WAF with Edge Delivery Services can lead to erroneous content being delivered.
Edge Delivery Services needs no Web Application Firewall, as it is running on hardened, shared, and ultra-scalable infrastructure. Requests that a WAF would typically intercept are terminated in our CDNs.

http://www.aem.live/docs/redirects

Redirects
Every website has the need for redirects. For example if you relocate or delete content, you want your users to still be able to find it or the next best thing. See the document Authoring and Publishing Content for more information on deleting content.
You can intuitively manage redirects as a spreadsheet called redirects (or redirects.xlsx) in the root of your project folder.
The spreadsheet has to contain at least two columns titled Source and Destination.
The Source is relative to the domain of your website, so it only contains the relative path.
The Destination can be either a fully qualified URL if you are redirecting to a different website, or it can be a relative path if you are redirecting within your own website.
After making changes to your redirects spreadsheet, you can preview your changes via the sidekick and have your stakeholders check that the redirects are working on your .page preview website before publishing the redirect changes to your production website. See the Sidekick documentation for more information about switching between environments.Redirects take precedence over existing content, which means that if you have an existing page with a given URL, defining a redirect for that same URL will serve the redirect for that page and “hide” the existing page. Conversely if a redirect that has been set up on an existing page is removed, the existing page will be served again, unless the page was unpublished.
Remember that if your redirect workbook has multiple pages (worksheets), then the redirects will only work on the sheet that is called helix-default. This allows you to manage more complex redirects through spreadsheet formulas. The spreadsheets and JSON documentation page has all the details.
Wildcards Redirects
Wildcard redirects have a set of issues around (a) unmanaged complexity and accumulate tech debt over time, (b) introducing potential redirect loops and also tend to (c) 301 into 404. For those reasons we generally recommend avoiding patterns-based wildcard redirects, and instead create redirects based on actual "usage" data.
However there are some cases where individually managed redirects are inflating the list of redirects, and for practical or perceived initial simplicity reasons it may be compelling to use pattern based redirects. For example, you might want to apply a redirect to all pages under a specific path, regardless of the exact URL. This is where using wildcards in your CDN can be helpful. Wildcards allow you to match multiple URLs under a common path, simplifying the redirection of entire sections of your site.
Example: If you want to redirect all URLs under /old-path/ to /new-path/, including any subpages (e.g., /old-path/page1, /old-path/page2), you can configure a wildcard redirect in your CDN.
Input URL pattern: /old-path/*
Redirect to: /new-path/$1
The wildcard (*) captures anything after /old-path/, and $1 represents the captured part of the URL, ensuring the structure is maintained in the new location.
Keep in mind that redirecting this way usually redirects the entire namespace and hence creates redirects (301) into 404 for an infinite number of URLs and may therefore lead to undesirable results.
Note: The specifics of configuring these redirects depend on the CDN provider you are using. Different vendors may have their own syntax, interface, and capabilities for handling wildcards and advanced redirect rules. Always consult the documentation of your specific CDN for guidance on how to implement wildcard redirects.
Site Migrations and SEO
When migrating your site to AEM Edge Delivery Services, this may necessitate some changes to the URLs your site uses. This can have an impact on SEO, so it is important that you plan for this carefully to avoid any disruption. We recommend the following steps to handle the most common scenarios:
Add your most popular URLs to the redirects sheet to ensure these are handled properly via 301 redirects
If the change to URLs follows a common pattern, for example, removing .html from all urls, set this up as a wildcard redirect at your CDN
If the change includes more complex situations than a common pattern, best practice is to map the old and new URLs 1-to-1.
If you are pruning content as part of your migration, avoid the temptation to redirect these urls to a common destination such as your home page; See the “Avoid irrelevant redirects” note in Google's documentation on site moves for more information
Ensure your sitemap is up to date
After go-live, monitor 404s via Operational Telemetry and add missing redirects as needed
For more information, see Google's documentation on site moves.

Audit log
Admin and indexing operations are recorded in an audit log that can be queried via an Admin endpoint.
Only users who have the role admin.role.author can read the audit logs, see Project Configuration for more information.
There’s also a handy tool to look at the audit logs.
Admin operations
The audit log stores information about the following successful Admin operations:
The following information about those operations is stored:
Indexing operations
The audit log stores information about the outcome of background indexing operations, namely:
Examples
Here are some examples of how common operations triggered via Sidekick will be reflected in the audit log:
Retention policy
Edge Delivery Services audit logs are kept indefinitely, or as long as the customer wants to keep them.

AEM Sidekick Security
This page describes security aspects of the Sidekick such as required browser permissions, privacy and network requests being made during operation.
You can also refer to the following resources for additional information:
The listing page in Google Chrome Web Store
The manifest file on GitHub (open source)
The extension’s context menu
Browser Permissions
The Sidekick requires the following browser permissions as defined in its manifest file to function as expected:
Required to persist the following:
state settings (local storage)
project configurations (synchronized across devices)
access tokens (session storage)
Required hosts:
http://localhost:3000/* (see Local Development)
https://*/* (used to determine whether to show or hide the Sidekick based on a tab’s URL)
Privacy
The Sidekick collects user activity allowing Adobe to:
Learn how users interact with the UI
Enhance the user experience in future releases
All data collected is:
Minimal: names of actions users click in the user interface and target URLs.
Sampled: only every 10th interaction triggers data collection.
Anonymous: no PII is being transmitted or stored.
Secure: Data is transmitted using HTTPS and only authorized Adobe personnel have access to stored data.
Adobe further declares that user data is:
Not being sold to third parties
Not being used or transferred for purposes that are unrelated to the item's core functionality
Not being used or transferred to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes
Network Requests
The Sidekick performs HTTPS request to the following hosts:
Restricting Access
You can restrict the Sidekick’s access to certain hosts for all users in your enterprise by defining the runtime_blocked_hosts and runtime_allowed_hosts settings in your enterprise’s Chrome profile. See Google’s documentation on Managing Extensions in Your Enterprise for more information.
Example 1: Allow everything, deny few
This would prevent the Sidekick extension from interacting with any URL matching https://intranet.example.com/* or https://extranet.example.com/*.
Example 2: Deny everything, allow few
This would prevent the Sidekick extension from interacting with any URL, except the ones matching a pattern defined in runtime_allowed_hosts. This example uses a combination of the host_permissions in the manifest file and the list of URLs from the chapter Network Requests above to ensure maximum functionality and an optimal user experience.
Security Audits
The Sidekick’s entire source code is publicly available and – like all of AEM – subject to regular audits performed by 3rd party security researchers. Reports can be shared with customers and prospects under NDA.

Extending the Sidekick
The goal of this document is to explain how developers can interact with the sidekick, and how it can be customized at a project level.
Events
The sidekick emits the following events:
(object) An object with the following properties:
(string) sourceUrl: The source URL
(string) targetUrl: The target URL
(object) An object with the following properties:
(object) config: The sidekick configuration
(object) location: The location object
(object) status: The status object
An event’s payload can be found in the event.detail property.
Listening for Events
In your project code (e.g. in /scripts/scripts.js), you can react to sidekick events as follows (replace foo with the name of the event you want to listen for):
Customizing the Sidekick
You can customize the sidekick for your project. You can add a /tools/sidekick/config.json configuration file to your project's GitHub repository or use the configuration service.
For all available configuration options, see the config schema. Here are some basics to get you started:
Host Settings
Note: The following host properties are optional in the sidekick configuration and should only be used to explicitly override the CDN settings in your site configuration:
host (string) The host name of the production website (overrides cdn.prod.host)
previewHost (string) The host name of the preview environment (overrides cdn.preview.host, defaults to *.aem.page)
liveHost (string) The host name of the live environment (overrides cdn.live.host, defaults to *.aem.live)
reviewHost (string) The host name of the review environment (overrides cdn.review.host, defaults to *.aem.reviews)
Plugins
Plugins allow you to add custom functionality to the sidekick, enhancing your users’ experience.
Common Plugin Properties
The following properties are applicable to all plugin types:
id (string) is mandatory and must be unique within a sidekick configuration.
title (string) will be shown on the plugin button.
titleI18n (object<string, string>) defines optionally translated titles.
pinned (boolean) determines if the plugin is pinned to the toolbar (default) or folded into the … menu.
environments (string[]) specifies where the plugin should appear (dev, edit, admin, preview, live, or prod).
exclude_paths (string[]) defines patterns to exclude the plugin based on the path in the current tab’s URL.
include_paths (string[]) defines patterns to include the plugin based on the path in the current tab’s URL.
URL-based Plugins
You can specify a url that will be opened in a new tab when the plugin button is clicked:
The following properties are specific to URL-based plugins:
passConfig (boolean) pass the project configuration via query parameters
passReferrer (boolean) pass the originating URL via query parameters
Event-based Plugins
Alternatively, you can specify the name of an event to be fired when the plugin button is clicked. This allows the execution of custom JavaScript code in the context of your page by listening for the event on the sidekick element. Custom events will have a custom: prefix. For your convenience, the custom event dispatched contains a copy of the current sidekick state.
Note: Event-based plugins can only be used in the following environments: Development, Preview, Live and Production. Executing custom code is not possible in Edit or Admin.
In your project code (e.g. in /scripts/scripts.js), you can react to the event as follows:
Special Plugin Types
Palette Plugins
Palettes are variants of URL-based plugins which load the configured URL inside a floating palette instead of opening a new tab.
isPalette (boolean) opens the target of a URL-based plugin in a palette instead of a new tab.
paletteRect (string) optionally defines the size and position of the palette in the format of a DOMRect.
The following example creates a standard palette placed at the bottom left of the window:
If you wish to change the size and positioning of your palette, use paletteRect:
Popover Plugins
Popovers are variants of URL-based plugins which load the configured URL inside a popover instead of opening a new tab. Popovers are centered above the plugin's button.
isPopover (boolean) opens the target of a URL-based plugin in a popover instead of a new tab.
popoverRect (string) optionally defines the width and height of the popover in the format of a DOMRect.
If you wish to change the width or height of your palette, use popoverRect:
A theme query parameter is appended to the URL to style the iframe in line with the current sidekick theme. If no background color is set on the content’s body, it will inherit the popover’s translucent background.
Container Plugins
Containers allow you grouping plugins together and help save space in the toolbar. Clicking a container plugin simply toggles its dropdown, it can’t have its own URL or event action.
isContainer (boolean) renders a plugin as a dropdown instead of a button.
containerId (string) adds a plugin to a container plugin with the specified ID.
The following example creates a container named “Tools” and places a plugin “Foo” in it:
Badge Plugins
Badges allow you to add labels to the sidekick under certain conditions. They will be rendered on the right hand side of the toolbar. Badges have a merley decorative purpose and can’t be clicked.
isBadge (boolean) renders a plugin as a badge instead of a button.
badgeVariant (string) optionally determines the badge’s color scheme (gray, red, orange, yellow, chartreuse, celery, green, seafoam, cyan, blue, indigo, purple, fuchsia, or magenta)
The following example adds a “Stage” badge to the sidekick in the preview environment:
Custom Edit URLs
If your project does not use SharePoint or Google Drive as content source, you can tell the sidekick how to link to your custom editing environment when the user clicks Edit.
The following two config options are available:
editUrlLabel (string) set the label visible to the user
editUrlPattern (string) defines an URL pattern for the custom editing environment. Supports placeholders like {{contentSourceUrl}} or {{pathname}}.
Special Views
You can specify a special view for the sidekick to redirect to when the current tab’s URL matches a certain pattern. This can help you provide a seamless user experience across different media types, and also enables the execution of custom code (event-based plugins). The original resource URL will be available in a url query parameter.
The properties path and viewer are mandatory. Optionally, you can specify a title that will be shown at the top, and you can provide localized titles in a titleI18n object:
At the path specified by viewer, add an HTML file to your GitHub repository, for example:
Add an optional CSS file in the same directory, and a JS file with your custom logic, for example:
Development Workflow
The following workflows are designed for detached sidekick development to prevent unintentional disruptions for the authors on your production site:
Using a Site Copy
If your site’s configuration is stored in the Configuration Service, you can use temporary site copies for sidekick development:
Create a copy of your site in the Configuration Service. For example, if the name of your original site is site1, you could create a site1-dev, reusing the same code and content.
Open the preview URL for site1-dev in your browser: https://main--site1-dev--org.aem.page.
Make your desired changes to the sidekick object in the site1-dev configuration.
Refresh the browser tab after each change to test your changes.
When done, copy the sidekick object from site1-dev to the site1 configuration to roll your changes out to all authors.
Note: When using the sidekick in an editor environment (Google Drive or Microsoft Sharepoint), it will load the config from the original site by default. If you want the sidekick to let you choose which configuration to load, first add the new site to your sidekick from the preview or live URL. Now the sidekick will display a picker with all matching sites.
Using a Repository Branch
If your site’s configuration is not stored in the Configuration Service, you can use a branch in GitHub for sidekick development:
On your site’s GitHub repository, create a branch from main. For this example, we’ll use dev as the branch name.
Open the preview URL for the dev branch in your browser: https://dev--site1--org.aem.page.
Open or create the following file in your repository: /tools/sidekick/config.json.
Make your desired changes to the sidekick configuration file and push changes to the dev branch.
Refresh the browser tab after each change to test your changes.
When done, create a pull request and merge the changes to the main branch of your repository.
Caution: Never commit directly to the main branch in your original repository. Always create a branch and ask for a review of your changes via pull request before merging into main.
Note: When using the sidekick in an editor environment (Google Drive or Microsoft Sharepoint), it will load the config from the original site by default. If you want the sidekick to let you choose which configuration to load, first add the new site to your sidekick from the preview or live URL. Now the sidekick will display a picker with all matching sites.

What is the Sidekick Library?
The Sidekick Library is an extension for the AEM Sidekick that enables developers to create UI-driven tooling for content authors. It includes a built-in blocks plugin that can display a list of all blocks to authors in an intuitive manner, removing the need for authors to remember or search for every variation of a block. Developers can also write their own plugins for the sidekick library.
How to use the Sidekick Library?
The steps below detail how to setup the sidekick library and configure the blocks plugin.
Library Sheet Setup
The sidekick library is populated with your plugins and plugin content using a sheet.
1. Start by creating a directory in sharepoint or gdrive where you want to store the content for the library. We recommend storing the content in /tools/sidekick (or any other name) in the root of the mountpoint. The next steps will assume the directory is called /tools/sidekick.
2. Next, create a workbook (an Excel file) in the /tools/sidekick directory called library (or any other name). Each sheet in the workbook represents a plugin that will be loaded by the Sidekick Library. The name of the sheet determines the name of the plugin that will be loaded. Any data contained in the sheet will be passed to the plugin when loaded. The plugin sheet name must be prepended with helix-. For example, if you want to load a plugin called tags, you would create a sheet named helix-tags.
3. For this tutorial we will create a sheet for our blocks plugin. Create a sheet (or rename the default sheet) and call it `helix-blocks` and leave it empty for now.
Blocks Plugin
The Sidekick library comes with a blocks plugin.
Blocks Plugin Setup
To generate content for the blocks plugin, you need to prepare a separate Word document for each block you want to include.
1. Create a directory inside the /tools/sidekick directory where you will store all the block variations. For example, you could create a directory called blocks inside /tools/sidekick.2. For this example, let's assume we want to define all the variations of a block called columns. First create a Word document called columns inside the blocks directory and provide examples of all the variations of the columns block. After each variation of the block add in a section delimiter.3. Preview and publish the columns document.4. Open the library workbook created in the last section, inside the helix-blocks sheet, create two columns named name and path.6. Next we need to add a row for our columns block. Add the name of the block in the first column and the url to the document that defines the block variations in the second column. For instance, if you want to add the columns block, you could create a row with the name Columns and the path /tools/sidekick/blocks/columns. In order for the library to work across environments (page, live, prod) you should not use an absolute url for the path column.7. Preview and publish the library workbook.
> Since the example blocks are being published you should use bulk metadata to exclude the content inside of /tools/** from being indexed.
Example library.xlsx
Library Metadata
The blocks plugins supports a special type of block called library metadata which provides a way for developers to tell the blocks plugin some information about the block or how it should be rendered.
Supported library metadata options
Default Library metadata vs Library metadata
There are two types of library metadata. Library metadata that lives within a section containing the block, or default library metadata that applies to the document as a whole and lives in a section on it's own (a block called library metadata as the only child in a section).
Let's take an example of a hero block that has 5 variants. Suppose you want to add the same description for each variation of the block, rather than duplicating the library metadata with the description into each section containing the variations. You could instead use default library metadata to apply the same description to every variation of the block. If you decide that one variation actually needs a slightly different description you could add library metadata to the section containing the variation and it would override the default library metadata description when it's rendered within the blocks plugin.
Authoring block names and descriptions using Library Metadata
By default the block name (with variation) will be used to render the item in the blocks plugin. For example, if the name of the block is columns (center, background) then that name will be used as the label when it’s rendered in the blocks plugin. This can be customized by creating a library metadata section within the same section as the block. Library metadata can also be used to author a description of the block as well as adding searchTags to include an alias for the block when using the search feature.
Example block with custom name and description
Content
Display
Autoblocks and Default Content
The blocks plugin is capable of rendering default content and autoblocks. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to place your default content or autoblock within a dedicated section, which should include a library metadata table defining a name property, as previously described. If no name is specified in the library metadata, the item will be labeled as "Unnamed Item."
Blocks composed of content in subsequent sections
There are situations where developers may want a block to consist of content from subsequent sections. This pattern is discouraged for reasons stated here, but if you choose to use it the blocks plugin can render these items using the include next sections property in library metadata.
Templates
Templates are a way to group an entire document into a single element in the sidekick library. To mark a document as a template set type to template in default library metadata.
> Important, the library metadata needs to be in it's own section and be the only child to be considered default library metadata.
Supporting metadata is also desirable for templates. To add a metadata table to the template you can use a Page metadata block.
When the template is copied a metadata with the values will be added along with the content to the clipboard.
Sidekick plugin setup
Since the sidekick library is hosted on the same origin as the content, a static HTML page needs to be created to load and configure the content.
1. Create a file called library.html in tools/sidekick/;
2. Paste the following code in library.html.
In the code above we load the sidekick library from aem.live and then create a custom sidekick-library element and add it to the page. The sidekick-library element accepts a config object that is required to configure the sidekick library.
Supported configuration parameters
The blocks plugin supports the following configuration properties that can be set using the plugins object.
Blocks plugin configuration parameters
Examples
Encoding images
Custom viewports (short form)
Custom viewports
Custom table header colors
You can customize the table header background and foreground color when pasting a block, section metadata or metadata that was copied from the blocks plugin.
Default styles can be set in library.html using css variables.
These values can be overridden using library metadata.
> Depending on the system color scheme selected for the users computer (dark mode), Word may alter the chosen colors in an attempt to improve accessibility.
Custom plugin setup
The example below defines a tags plugin in the config. The keys of the plugins object must match the name of the plugin, any other properties defined in the plugin object will be available to the plugin via the context argument of the decorate method.
Extended Libraries
In some cases merging two block libraries may be desirable. When an extended library is defined the sidekick library application will merge the base library and the extended library together into a single library list for authors.
The example below defines a base library and an extended library (on another origin) that will be merged into the base library.
> The Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers will need to be set on the library.json and blocks of the extended library in order for them to load in the sidekick library. See Custom HTTP Response Headers for more info.
> Due to same-origin policies enforced by browsers on iframes a preview of an extended block cannot be loaded at this time.
Sidekick config.json setup
Next, in order for the sidekick library to appear in the sidekick a config file needs to be created at tools/sidekick/config.json. This config file needs to be created in the code bus and should be checked into github.
The url property in the plugin configuration indicates the location from which the sidekick should load the plugin. This should point to the library.html file we previously created.
> The sidekick config must be checked into the main branch in order to for the plugin to appear in the sidekick.
> If the tools/sidekick/config.json file does not exist in your github repository, it must be created. For more information on sidekick plugin configuration options, see the docs.
Considerations when building blocks for the library
The sidekick library renders blocks by first fetching the plain.html rendition of the the block and then strips it of any other blocks in the content (for example if there are multiple variations of a block in the response). It then requests the same page (without .plain.html) and replaces the main element with the stripped block and loads the entire document into an iframe using the srcdoc attribute.
Use of window.location
Since the block is loaded in an iframe using the srcdoc attribute, the instance of the window.location object used by your sites code will not contain the typical values you would expect to see.
Example window.location object when running in the library
For this reason, if your block requires use of the window.location object we recommend adding the following functions to your scripts.js file and importing them into your function for use.
Use of createOptimizedPicture in lib-aem
The createOptimizedPicture function in lib-aem also uses window.location.href. If you are using this function we recommend moving it into scripts.js and modify it to use the getHref() function above.
Checking for the presence of the sidekick library
Sometimes you may want to know if the page or the block is running in the sidekick library. To do this there are a couple of options.
1. Check if window.location.href === 'about:srcdoc'
2. The main element and the block element will contain the sidekick-library class
Building a Plugin
Developing a plugin is similar to constructing a block in AEM. Once a user tries to load the plugin, the sidekick library will trigger the decorate() method on your plugin. This method receives the container to render the plugin in and any data that is included in the plugins sheet.
> The decorate() function must be exported from the plugin.
Plugin default export & search
The default export from a plugin allows authors to customize the plugin name displayed in the header upon loading, as well as activate the search functionality within the sidekick library.
When the searchEnabled property is true, the library header will display a search icon upon loading the plugin. If the user initiates a search by entering a query, the decorate() function of the plugin will be triggered again, this time with the search string passed in the query parameter of the decorate() function.
Plugin web components
Plugin authors can utilize a select set of web components from Spectrum when building a custom plugin.
The following components from Spectrum are available
The following icons from Spectrum are also available
Plugin Events
Plugin authors can dispatch events from their plugin to the parent sidekick library in order to display a loader or to show a toast message.

Picking the right CDN
A Content Delivery Network makes sure that your visitors get your site served as fast as possible when entering your domain name. Adobe Experience Manager integrates with many popular CDN choices, but if you are unsure which one to pick, answer the questions below
Questionnaire
Cloudflare (Enterprise)
AEM customers use Cloudflare Enterprise and benefit from fast and fine-granular purging, powerful extensibility with Cloudflare Workers, support for multiple backends, and zero-trust security support. It's also an all-around good CDN.
Learn how to set up Cloudflare for Adobe Experience Manager
Cloudflare (Free)
Cloudflare's free option is a great choice for smaller sites, as the free tier comes with included traffic and support for Cloudflare Workers. It does not support key-based purging, which means for some updates Adobe Experience Manager has to purge the entire site, making Cloudflare free unsuitable for large sites with frequent content updates.
Learn how to set up Cloudflare for Adobe Experience Manager
Cloudfront
Cloudfront is the CDN that is included in your Amazon Web Services contract. It is a passable CDN that is supported by Adobe Experience Manager, but many important features are missing such as support for fine-granular content purges. This makes Cloudfront unsuitable for sites with lots of content and a high frequency of updates.
If this does not discourage you, here is how to set up Cloudfront for Adobe Experience Manager
Fastly (self-managed)
If you are already a Fastly customer, then you know why Adobe Experience Manager integrates with it out of the box: a rock-solid and blazingly fast CDN with fine-grained push invalidation that you can configure using Fastly's VCL language.
Learn how to set up Fastly for Adobe Experience Manager
Fastly (managed by Adobe Experience Manager)
Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service bundles the Fastly CDN, which means it's included in your contract. Advanced configuration options require using configuration pipelines in Cloud Manager, so you combine the best of YAML with VCL.
Learn how to set up Adobe Managed CDN
Fastly (managed by Adobe Commerce)
As an Adobe Commerce customer, you have access to the bundled Fastly CDN. It's a great choice of CDN, rock-solid, blazingly fast, and, thanks to VCL, extremely configurable with plenty of public documentation.
Learn how to set up Fastly for Adobe Experience Manager
Akamai
Akamai is the market-leading CDN and if you are a customer, there is no reason not to use it with Adobe Experience Manager. Akamai supports push invalidation at reasonable speed and can combine sites with multiple backends, which helps when migrating a legacy site to fast edge delivery.
Set up Akamai for Adobe Experience Manager in 13 easy steps.

Set up push invalidation for AWS Cloudfront
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
NB: CloudFront does NOT support purging by cache tag/key. Purge by cache tag/key always triggers a purge all.Configuration properties:
To create the AWS credentials:
In the AWS Console, open the IAM dashboard, then select Policies → Create policy:
In the following screen, select "CloudFront" as a service, and "CreateInvalidation" as action, then click "Add ARNs" to restrict the permissions to a single distribution.
Enter you Distribution Id and click on “Add ARNs”:
Proceed to “Next: Tags” and then “Next: Review”.Enter a name for the new policy, e.g. “AEM<YourSite>Invalidate”, and click on “Create policy”:
In the IAM dashboard, select Users → Create user
Enter a user name (e.g. “Invalidator”) and click on Next:
On the “Set permissions” pane, select “Attach policies directly” and select the newly created policy (“AEM<YourSite>Invalidate” in our example):
Proceed to the next step, click on “Create user” end then “View user”:
Select the “Security credentials” tab and click on “Create access key”:
Select “Third-party service”, click the checkbox and proceed to “Next”:
Finally, copy the Access key ID and Secret access key values:
You can validate the credentials with this tool.

Adobe Managed CDN
The following steps illustrate how to use the Adobe Managed CDN (part of Edge Delivery Services entitlement) to configure a property to deliver content from a site powered by Edge Delivery Services in Adobe Experience Manager Sites as a Cloud Service.
Prerequisites and limitations
You must have a license with an Edge Delivery Services entitlement.
You must own the domain under which you want to serve your site.
You need to be able to make Domain Name System (DNS) changes to the domain name.
You have the choice to bring your own certificate or ask Adobe to provide one provisioned by Let’s Encrypt.
HTTPS is required and IPv6 is not supported.
Before you go live
There are two deployment options for going live with Adobe Managed CDN
Setup an HTTP proxy from an existing AEM Sites as a Cloud Service environment. This is typically used when you already have an existing environment and you want to migrate part of a site to Edge Delivery Services. You can also add a new environment.
Setup a new Edge Delivery site independently of an AEM Sites as a Cloud Service environment. This is the approach used when you do not have an AEM author or publish environment and you want to use Edge Delivery Services on its own. See here for benefits.
A checklist of the steps you need to do for both options:
Install or request a certificate in Cloud Manager (you need to do that for both www and non-www apex domains)
Install the domains Cloud Manager (you need to do that for both www and apex domains)
Add a CDN configuration to map your domain to your Edge Delivery site. (This will be done differently depending on what deployment option you chose)
Setup push invalidation in the project's configuration
Point the DNS CNAME of your www site to cdn.adobeaemcloud.com and the A records of your apex to the IP addresses listed below.
(Option 1) Setup a proxy from an existing environment
This requires an existing AEM Sites as a Cloud Service environment that needs to be configured via configuration pipeline to proxy some (or all) paths on your domain to your Edge Delivery Site. (see how to define a proxy using originSelectors and how to run a Configuration Pipeline).
A redirect from https://example.com to https://www.example.com must be defined using a redirect rule, but all other redirects may use the redirects spreadsheet
(Option 2) Setup an Edge Delivery site without an existing environment
In case you do not have an existing authoring/publish environment, follow the steps for setting up a new Edge Delivery site in Cloud Manager.
An automatic redirect will be established from https://example.com to https://www.example.com but all other redirects must happen through the redirects spreadsheet
Setup push invalidation
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the managed CDN whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by URL and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration. Depending on how you author your content, this is done in two different ways:
If you author your content with Sharepoint or Google Docs, create an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive.
If you author your content with AEM Authoring and the Universal Editor, create a spreadsheet called configuration in the Sites console.
If your site is using the configuration service, see here how to update the CDN configuration.
In the spreadsheet, define the following configuration properties:
After making changes to the configuration sheet, preview it with the Sidekick or publish it in the Sites console to activate the changes.
(Optional) Lower the TTL of existing DNS records before going live to enable a faster rollout
If the DNS records for your go-live domain have a long time-to-live (TTL)—such as 12 hours or more—you may want to temporarily lower the TTL (for example, to 1 hour or even 60 seconds) to speed up site rollout. Doing so ensures traffic is routed to the new site more quickly after launch. Be sure to restore the original TTL value when updating the DNS records for go-live.
As you go live
Make or request following DNS change:
For www.example.com set the CNAME DNS record to cdn.adobeaemcloud.com (see details).
Use a high time-to-live (TTL) value of 3600 seconds (one hour) or more to improve site reliability during a DNS outage. If you previously lowered the TTL for a faster go-live rollout, make sure to restore it to its original longer value.
If you want to establish an automatic redirect from https://example.com to https://www.example.com, the following additional steps are required
For example.com set the A record to these four IP addresses: 151.101.3.10, 151.101.67.10, 151.101.131.10, and 151.101.195.10 (see details)
If your DNS provider cannot support multiple IP addresses in an A record (for example, GoDaddy), use any of the listed IP addresses. This will be a bit less reliable.
Use the same high TTL as described above
Depending on your DNS setup—including the TTL specified in your DNS records—changes can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours to propagate. If your site already receives traffic, ensure all redirects are configured or keep the existing site live until the TTL expires and all traffic is routed to the new site.
If you are hosting both the apex and www versions of the domain, make sure DNS is properly configured for both to enable certificate generation.
For a timed launch, consider setting up a temporary holding homepage that you can quickly replace with the final content at the launch time. Because publishing in AEM is fast and reliable, this approach gives you better control over when your content becomes publicly visible than relying solely on DNS changes.
After you go live
The AEM team reviews your setup and notifies you if any issues are found.

Setting up the configuration service
The Configuration Service is used to aggregate and deliver configuration for various consumers in the AEM architecture including: Client, Delivery, HTML Pipeline, and Admin Service.
Configurations stored in the client scope can be consumed from your site or the AEM Sidekick and control functionality and behavior for visitors and authors. All other configurations are internal to the AEM infrastructure and cannot be accessed directly.
The configuration is managed using REST calls to the Admin service (admin.hlx.page). See AEM Admin API for details of the API.
For existing AEM projects (coming from hlx.live) projects, the configuration service aggregates a valid configuration based on the various sources (fstab.yaml, .helix/config.xlsx, etc). This ensures backward compatibility, but means that some features are not available in this document mode (the traditional, distributed configuration).
One of the new features that the configuration service can support is independent code and content definitions per site. A site is a combination of an org name and a site name. This is similar to the GitHub owner and repo tuple, but has no longer a relation to the GitHub project.
For example, a site named website of the org acme could have a code repository adobe/helix-website. The preview URL follows the same scheme, but using site and org instead. In this example: https://main--website--acme.aem.page.
.
With this new mechanism, it is now possible to have multiple sites that use different content, but use the same code repository. This feature is also known as “repoless”.
Prerequisites
There are some rules and constraints when creating new setups that use the configuration service:
Any aem.live organization needs also to exist as github.com org, and at least one repository needs to be synced using AEM Code Sync. This ensures that the organization namespace is properly claimed by an entity that can also claim an org on github.com. The github.com org can exceptionally be created by Adobe or a trusted implementation partner on the customer’s behalf, but it must have at least one owner from the customer's organization.
For projects that want to use multiple sites with the same code repository (repoless), there must be one canonical site for which the org/site matches the github owner/repo. This is required for proper code-config association and CDN push invalidation.
Create your Organization
Once your first site is up and running, contact an Adobe representative to create the aem.live org for you and add the administrative user(s).
Add your Sites
In this example we will create two new sites, website and products of the acme org, which will both share the same github repository: acme/website. The content is managed in sharepoint, at a fictitious https://acme.sharepoint.com/sites/aem/Shared%20Documents/website and .../products.
We assume that the acme org is already set up and a user was defined that can manage the site configurations.
1. Create new configuration for the first site
Make sure that you are properly authenticated, then using the Admin API, we create the first site:
The new site is now available at https://main--website--acme.aem.page. Most likely only the 404.html is shown, as no content has been previewed yet.
2. Create new configuration for the second site
Using the Admin API, we create the second site:
The new site is now available at https://main--products--acme.aem.page. Most likely only the 404.html is shown, as no content has been previewed.
Updating a site's configuration
You can update the site configuration either as a whole document, or only certain sub-structures. Here are some examples:
Update Access Control
Use this to assign roles to your users. For example, to add user bob to the configuration admin role:
Update Code Location
Use this to switch your site to a different code base (see also repoless):
Update Production CDN
Use this to configure the CDN settings:
Update Headers
Use this to set custom HTTP headers:
Update Folders
Use this to update the folder mappings.
Update Public Custom Configuration
Use this to define public project configuration, for example for easy consumption on the client side:
Caution: Do not store any secrets in public configuration! It will be accessible to everyone at https://<your-host>/config.json.
Update Sidekick Configuration
Use this to customize the Sidekick:
Update sitemap.yaml
Update robots.txt
Use this to customize instructions for robots and crawlers:
Remove unused configuration files
Once you have enabled the configuration service, the configuration settings there override the settings you have in configuration files in your GitHub repository and your content source, so it is best to remove them:
First remove the files from github:
fstab.yaml
robots.txt
tools/sidekick/config.json
helix-query.yaml
helix-sitemap.yaml
And after those are removed, check if the hlx.page preview page returns a 404. This means that the internal configuration of the repository based config is cleaned up. Then you can also unpreview and delete the configuration in /.helix folder in your content:
.helix/config.xlsx
.helix/headers.xlsx

http://www.aem.live/docs/repoless

Repoless - One codebase, many sites
If you have many similar sites that mostly look and behave the same, but have different content, you may want to share code across multiple sites. In the past, the best way to do this was to create multiple GitHub repositories, keep them somehow in sync, and run each site off a dedicated GitHub repository.
AEM supports running multiple sites from the same codebase without having to take care of code replication. This ability is also known as "repoless", because all but your first site don't need a GitHub repository of their own.
Follow this document to learn how to create and manage multiple sites off the same codebase. Make sure you have followed the developer tutorial, as it provides the basics of creating a site on AEM.
How this works
Repoless sites are enabled by the Configuration Service in Adobe Experience Manager, which introduces a couple of concepts such as Organization, Profile, Repository, Site, and Content Source. The following diagram shows how the pieces fit together.
Organization
Each site in Adobe Experience Manager belongs to an organization. This organization has the same name as an org on github.com, so that there is no naming conflict. An organization can have multiple sites, profiles, and users.
Profile
Profiles are a way to group and re-use important configurations such as headers, indexes, additional metadata, and so on. A profile can be used by multiple sites within an organization, so that there is consistency among them.
GitHub Repository
For each codebase in Adobe Experience Manager, there is one GitHub repository. By creating a first site that uses this repository through AEM Code Sync, this code will be made available to Adobe Experience Manager and can then be used by multiple sites. When updates are pushed to the GitHub repository, they apply to all sites that use this codebase.
Site
A site combines content, code, and configuration to create a new web experience. Configuration can be attached directly to the site, or it can be referenced from a profile. While a profile can be used by multiple sites, each site can have only one profile. When there is a conflict between the configuration settings in a site and in a profile, the site configuration wins.
Which content source and which codebase to use for a site are configuration settings, too. This enables the re-use of code and repoless sites.
Content Source
The content that makes up a site is pulled from a content source when authors preview or publish content. Typical sources include Microsoft Sharepoint and Google Drive, or the bring-your-own-markup adapter.
Create your first base site
The first step to creating a bunch of sites is to create a first site. This site can be used to serve content, but the most important job is to ensure that code is synchronized from your GitHub repository to all sites that use this codebase.
Note: Make sure that you are properly authenticated for all the calls to Admin API
Pre-requisites
Github Repository : https://github.com/{org}/{site}
Content Repository (Gdrive / Sharepoint) : https://{org}.sharepoint.com/sites/aem/Shared%20Documents/{site}
Create organization
Contact Adobe to create the organization for you. Note: you will be asked to provide the URL to a github.com organization you own. Learn more.
Confirm the organization is created and you have administrator privileges.
Note : Please contact Adobe to obtain administrative privileges to create the organization config
Create site within organization
Using the Admin API, we create the first site
The new site is now available at https://main--{site}--{org}.aem.page. Most likely only the 404.html is shown, as no content has been previewed yet.
Create a repoless site
Pre-requisites
Base site configured with code and content repository using the Admin API (see previous section)
Content Repository (Gdrive / Sharepoint) for new repoless site : https://{org}.sharepoint.com/sites/aem/Shared%20Documents/{site2}
Create your first repoless site
Using the Admin API, we create new configuration for the first repoless site
The new site is now available at https://main--{site2}--{org}.aem.page. Most likely only the 404.html is shown, as no content has been previewed.
Now we have created multiple sites sharing the same code base but different content repositories.
Additionally, you can use the Admin API to set other available advanced options to use within configuration management.
To view your new site during local development, use the ––url option on the aem up command to specify the new site’s url, like aem up ––url https://main––{site2}--{org}.aem.page .
What’s not needed once you go repoless
When you start with Adobe Experience Manager, many settings are kept either with your content in the content source, or in the GitHub repository next to your code. With the Configuration Service there is now a central place for these kinds of settings.
Below gives you a comparison between how different areas are configured when we use the document mode (the traditional, distributed configuration) vs. using the Configuration Service API.

Configuring Authentication for Authors
Enable Authentication for Authors
By default, authors don’t need to be logged in in order to use AEM via Sidekick. In order to enable authentication, it is sufficient to add relevant access-statements to your site configuration. Upon encountering said access-statements, the Sidekick will enforce authentication with the respective provider: Microsoft for Sharepoint based projects, and Google for Google Drive based projects.
Step 1: Add Access Allow To Configuration
Use the configuration service to update the access/admin section of your site configuration.
Add admin/role/author and or admin/role/publish array properties for each individual user or wildcard-domain you’d like to give access to the site for.
Example for an individual user: admin/role/publish: [ "some.user@example.com" ]Example for a wildcard domain: admin/role/author: [ "*@example.com" ]
The following example would grant author access all users within the “example.com” domain and publish rights to a the single user “some.user@example.com”:
Ensure that the users are able to authenticate themselves using their login credentials as follows:
If using Google Drive, they must be able to authenticate with their credentials using Google authentication.
If using Microsoft SharePoint, they must be able to authenticate with their credentials using Microsoft authentication.
Step 2: Login via Sidekick
The next time the Sidekick opens on a document, it will show a "Sign In" option:
Once you click it, it will open a new browser tab, redirecting to your respective provider:
The first time, it will ask for consent that the Admin service can access your Sharepoint or Google data. In case you are not an admin on the account, you will see the following message:
In this case, ask an Active Directory admin of your organization to login via Sidekick or directly via the admin link: https://admin.hlx.page/auth/microsoft
The admin can either grant consent directly by checking the ‘Consent on behalf of your organization’ when they log in, or later via the Azure Portal.
Now, the non admin user should be able to login:
Step 2 (Alternative) Granting Admin Consent via Azure Portal
In order to grant admin consent, open the Azure portal and go to:Home → Active Directory → Enterprise Application s
(Note that the application is only visible, if an admin has logged in in the steps above)
Search for the AEM Content Integration Admin API:
It should have the application id shown above.
Select the Permissions tab (below security):
And click on
.
After clicking Accept you can refresh the
blade a few times, until the consented permissions show up:
Using the Admin Service (admin.hlx.page)
When authentication is enabled for admin.hlx.page using the API endpoint with tools like curl will require to use a proper auth token. For one time ad-hoc use by developers it is very convenient to just copy/paste the x-auth-token header from your browser's network tab from an authenticated request sent by sidekick to admin.hlx.page and pass it into the curl via the -H option. eg:
Define user roles without enforcing authentication
By default, as soon as the role mapping is defined via an admin/role/* entry, authentication is enforced on that project. It might be desirable to allow unauthenticated access but still be able to define a user mapping, for example give a user the admin role.
The requireAuth property can be used for this with the following values:
auto is the default and enforces authentication as soon as a role mapping is defined.
true will always enforce authentication
false will not enforce authentication
Example:
Give the user bob@example.com the admin role but don’t enforce authentication:
Default Roles
If no role mapping is configured, the admin uses default roles to determine the permissions of the request. The default role can be specified using the admin/defaultRole property.
By default there are no default roles, unless requireAuth is auto, in this case the default role is basic_publish (see below). Example:
Use publish as default role:
Evaluation
The effective roles of a request are evaluated as follows:
If a request isn’t authenticated and requireAuth is true, a 401 status code is returned.
If a request isn’t authenticated and requireAuth is auto and role mapping is defined, a 401 status code is returned.
If a request isn’t authenticated the defaultRole is used.
If a request is authenticated and no role mapping is defined, or if requireAuth is false, the defaultRole is used.
If a request is authenticated and role mapping is defined and requireAuth is not false, the roles that match the user are used.
If no mapping matches, the user will have no role; effectively always returning a 403 status code.
If several mapping matches, the user will have a combined set of roles
If no mapping matches, the user will have no role; effectively always returning a 403 status code.
If several mapping matches, the user will have a combined set of roles

Further Reading
If you have set up the Configuration Service for your site, then you can use the following API operations to configure permissions for authors:
Create Site Configuration (applies to a single site)
Update Site Configuration (applies to a single site)
Create Profile Configuration (applies to multiple sites)
Update Profile Configuration (applies to multiple sites)
In each of these API requests, you will use the fields
groups (with the GroupsConfig schema) to define groups and assign group members
access.admin (with the AdminAccessConfig schema) to assign access permissions to groups or users

Document-based Project Configuration
This document explains how to set up a simple document-based project configuration. Note that for certain use cases, such as repoless sites or overlay content sources, you will need to use the configuration service instead.
The project configuration file is located in /.helix/config.xlsx (for sharepoint) or /.helix/config (for google drive). It consists of a table using Key and value columns. For example:
The format of the keys follows the identifier-dot notation, like in javascript. You can think of the sheets as a flattened JSON structure. If a key appears more than once, it would form an array, eg:
Will conceptually be a structure like:
The following table lists the configuration options of a project.
Also see the JSON Schema and Typescript Types of this config.
Note: Activate the configuration using the Sidekick for your configuration changes to become active.

http://www.aem.live/developer/folder-mapping

Folder Mapping
It’s not uncommon for websites to serve multiple URLs from a single document, displaying dynamic content for large portions of the page without authors having to create each page individually.
Some best practices scenarios where folder mapping is useful:
Commerce websites generating product pages from a product information API
Blogs with dynamic listing pages of posts for categories or tags
For a single-page application, mapping requests to a code-bus resource
AEM handles these cases via a folder mapping in the fstab.yaml file:
If your site uses the configuration service, you can manage folders in your site configuration. See here for instructions on how to update folders.
Anti-Patterns
Folder mapping should not be used for:
Sites using a combination of a large number of folder-mapped pages and frequently changing metadata. For such use cases, it is better to provide the content via different methods. Talk to your Adobe contact to learn more.
Mapping of excessively dynamic or infinite URLs like /search/<query>, dynamic search results are better served via query parameters or URL hash property
Generating non-cacheable content like user specific URLs. This can lead to cache pollution and possible security risks if content is unintentionally cached.
Folder-mapped Metadata
If the site has folder mapping configured, the metadata files within that folder will apply to all pages for that mapping. For example, if /templates/ is folder-mapped to /templates/default, metadata in /templates/default/metadata.xlsx will be applied to all pages below /templates/ if the URL pattern matches.
Last-Modified Date
Changes to folder-mapped metadata are not reflected in the last-modified HTTP response header of pages within the mapped scope. By default, the date of the last modification of the default document will be used. If you rely on that header value to be updated based on metadata changes, which may be desirable for SEO or SEM purposes, you can influence* it by adding an explicit last-modified column. This allows you to set the desired date string or timestamp for select rows only while leaving the others unchanged. We recommend the ISO date format to ensure it’s both human-readable and timezone-safe. .
Example:
* Note: The actual last-modified HTTP response header is calculated based on the modification times of the contributing resources to the response:
The source document itself (for folder-mapped pages, this is the default document)
The head.html
The global (and additional) metadata
The custom headers configuration
The most recent modification time of those resources will be used. This means that the last-modified value provided might not be the final header value if, for example, the head.html is younger.
Additional Considerations
There are some additional rules applied to bulk metadata for folder mapped pages, see Folder-mapped metadata in the bulk metadata documentation for details.

HTML Markup reference
While for most development tasks the DOM is the relevant interface for a developer, there are certain situations (eg. Auto Blocking) where a developer interacts with the raw HTML markup that is rendered by the Franklin pipeline on the server.
General HTML Markup Document structure
Metadata
The metadata portion of the document consists of a list of <meta> tags, some of them correspond to well known HTML metadata or metadata data without defined semantics. See more in the metadata block specification.
In the simplest case there is a eg.<meta name="template" content="docs">
which maps a metadata property named template to a value of docs.
head.html
The head.html portion of the document contains verbatim of what’s found in the head.html of the corresponding github branch.
Main Content
All the content that semantically maps to document semantics of an individual page or fragment is found in the main-content content section of the markup. It consists of default content, sections and blocks.
It is important that both default content and any cell of a block can contain the following HTML tags and attributes.
While most of those are self explanatory and align very much with their respective semantic definitions there are a couple that are worth calling out.
<h1> to <h6>
Headings 1 through 6 have an id= attribute containing a sanitized version of the .innerText to allow for direct addressing of a heading in a URL fragment
<picture>, <source> and <img>
Images are rendered as a <picture>, <source> and <img> combination, with a mobile and desktop breakpoint, as well as a fallback for browsers that don’t support webp.
The <img> element features a height= and width= attribute containing the intrinsic dimensions of the image as well as an alt= attribute with the alt text as provided.
<span>
The use of <span> is limited to icons, and indicates the icon as part of the class="icon icon-<iconname>" attribute
<a>
There is special handling for links to AEM preview and live domains (hlx.page, hlx.live, aem.page, aem.live). Any link to one of these domains is rendered as a relative link. This allows authors to link to any of these domain from content pages and still work across preview, live, and production domains.

Metadata Block
Notes:
The Metadata table is handled by the pipeline service to add <meta> tags in the <head> of the HTML markup delivered from the service. It does not appear verbatim in the HTML markup. There should only be one Metadata table per page and while its placement doesn’t matter, by convention it is placed at the bottom of the document.
The metadata table is essentially following an intuitive name/value pair structure where the name is in the first column of the table and the value is in the second column.
There are a few special properties that behave according to the HTML specification and popular additional metadata schemas like og: and twitter:. The well known metadata properties include title, description, and image. See special metadata properties for the full list.
There are also special semantics for theme and template which get added as classes to the <body> element by the boilerplate code and are often used for styling and autoblocking.
Beyond that, a project can add an arbitrary number of name value pairs that get added as <meta> tags to the markup, and can be used with project specific semantics.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
See Content in Document
Code:
The metadata table is processed as part of the HTML rendering service. There is no project code related to the processing.

Footer (Block)
Notes:
The footer block is loaded by default in the boilerplate project into the <footer> element.Out-of-the-box it provides a simple example for a footer but is likely to be extended or adjusted on the per project basis.
The footer block is usually not referenced by authors but is loaded automatically on every page.
The content for the footer is loaded as a fragment and is by default authored in a footer (or footer.docx) document.As footer structure and designs change rarely and are usually visually very different from the rest of the blocks on a site, it is often a good strategy to divide the content into sections and decorate specific classes onto the sections based on their sequence and apply CSS styling to those classes.
The footer document has its own lifecycle and when previewed or published applies to all pages that use a given navigation.
It is not uncommon to have multiple footer documents for a site eg. one per locale / language.
Example:

Notes:

The header block is usually not referenced by authors but is loaded automatically on every page.
The content for the navigation is loaded as a fragment and is by default authored in a nav (or nav.docx) document, and structured primarily into three sections for branding, navigation sections (nested <ul>) and tools.
The nav document has its own lifecycle and when previewed or published applies to all pages that use a given navigation.

Section Metadata
Notes:
The Section Metadata table is handled by boilerplate code internally to add data-*s attributes to the containing section.
Section Metadata table follows an intuitive name/value pair structure where the name is in the first column of the table and the value is in the second column.
The Style property is translated into a class while any other name will be transformed into a data-* attribute.
As Section Metadata generally adds complexity for authors, it is recommended to avoid it, until it is really necessary.

BYO CDN Setup
Customers may use their own CDN to deliver AEM content under their own domain (aka BYO Production CDN). While customers are generally free to configure their CDN according to their own needs there are some settings mandated/recommended by Adobe Experience Manager:
Origin urlhttps://main--<yoursite>--<yourorg>.aem.live
Headers sent to origin
X-Forwarded-Host: <production domain>
X-Push-Invalidation: enabled(see Configuring Push Invalidation)
X-Forwarded-Host: <production domain>
X-Push-Invalidation: enabled(see Configuring Push Invalidation)
Origin cache controlI.e. Cache TTL on the production CDN is controlled via origin cache control response headers. This should be enabled (if available).
Compression (gzip)Should be enabled
Query parameters
Must be forwarded to origin

Amazon Web Services (AWS) CloudFront Setup
The following screenshots illustrate how to configure AWS CloudFront to deliver content from an AEM origin. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
Create a CloudFront distribution
Configure the origin
Use main--sitename--orgname.aem.live as the Origin domain.
Add following custom headers:
X-Forwarded-Host: your domain name
X-BYO-CDN-Type: cloudfront
If you have successfully configured push invalidation for your project you should also add the following custom header:
X-Push-Invalidation: enabled
Cache behavior
Keep the default settings here.
Cache key and origin requests
Click "create cache policy"
Create cache policy
Set the Default TTL to 300 seconds.
Under "cache key settings", keep the defaults:
Headers: none
Cookies: none
Compression support: gzip, brotli
And override the following:
Query Strings: Include the following query strings
width
height
format
optimize
limit
offset
sheet
width
height
format
optimize
limit
offset
sheet
Close the browser tab and return to the previous screen. On this screen, click "create origin request policy".
Create origin request policy
Keep the default settings:
Headers: none
Cookies: none
And override the following:
Query Strings: Include the following query strings
width
height
format
optimize
limit
offset
sheet
width
height
format
optimize
limit
offset
sheet
Then click create and close the tab to return to the previous screen.
Apply Cache policy and origin request policy
After returning to the distribution properties, click the reload buttons next to the Cache policy and origin request policy dropdowns, so that the two newly-created policies show up. Next, select the new policies for both Cache policy and origin request policy.
Create distribution
Select whether you want to enable a Web Application Firewall (WAF). Your AEM origin requires no WAF and use of a WAF is neither required nor recommended for AEM origins.
Scroll to the end of the page and click "create distribution". We need to return to the configuration later, so remember the ID of your distribution.
Create Function to remove Age and X-Robots-Tag headers
In the Cloudfront sidebar, select "Functions" and click "Create function".
Enter a name for the function (e.g. stripHeaders), an optional description and click on “Create Function”:
Replace the code of the function with the following snippet and click on “Save changes”:
Select the "Publish" tab and click on “Publish function”:
Finally, associate the function with your distribution by scrolling down to "Associated distributions" and click "Add association".
In the following dialog, select:
Distribution: the ID of your new distribution
Event type: viewer response
Cache behavior: default
Finally, click "add association"
That’s all (more or less). Please test the distribution in a stage environment.
Optional: Authenticate Origin Requests
If you have enabled token-based Site Authentication, go back to Cloudfront → Distributions → <your distribution> → Origins → <your AEM origin> → Edit
Under "Add custom header", select "add header" and create a header Authorization with value token <your-auth-token>. Replace <your-auth-token> with the token value created through token-based Site Authentication (it starts with hlx_) as the header value.
This will ensure that all requests from the AWS Cloudfront CDN to your AEM origin use the correct authorization.
Set up push invalidation for AWS Cloudfront
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
NB: CloudFront does NOT support purging by cache tag/key. Purge by cache tag/key always triggers a purge all.Configuration properties:
To create the AWS credentials:
In the AWS Console, open the IAM dashboard, then select Policies → Create policy:
In the following screen, select "CloudFront" as a service, and "CreateInvalidation" as action, then click "Add ARNs" to restrict the permissions to a single distribution.
Enter you Distribution Id and click on “Add ARNs”:
Proceed to “Next: Tags” and then “Next: Review”.Enter a name for the new policy, e.g. “AEM<YourSite>Invalidate”, and click on “Create policy”:
In the IAM dashboard, select Users → Create user
Enter a user name (e.g. “Invalidator”) and click on Next:
On the “Set permissions” pane, select “Attach policies directly” and select the newly created policy (“AEM<YourSite>Invalidate” in our example):
Proceed to the next step, click on “Create user” end then “View user”:
Select the “Security credentials” tab and click on “Create access key”:
Select “Third-party service”, click the checkbox and proceed to “Next”:
Finally, copy the Access key ID and Secret access key values:
You can validate the credentials with this tool.

http://www.aem.live/docs/authentication-setup-site

Configuring Site Authentication
AEM Live supports token-based authentication. Site authentication is usually applied to both the preview and publish sites, but can also be configured to only protect either site individually.
Warning
Enabling Site Authentication for the publish sites (*.aem.live) will enforce authentication for all your site visitors (intranet). It will also prevent automatic PSI (Page Speed Insights) checks from running on your pull requests in GitHub. For use cases where your BYO CDN should use no (or different) authentication from your .live origin, you will need to configure preview only authentication or bypass authentication with an API_KEY.
Limitations
Only authentication is supported. Authorization is not supported.
Authentication can only be enabled or disabled for the entire site
It is not possible to create a custom error page for denied access
Enable Authentication for the Preview and Publish Sites
Click here to view instructions on how to update the configuration in document mode
1. Enable the Configuration Service
All of the following instructions use the Configuration Service for your site, so follow the linked instructions to enable and authenticate, then perform the following API requests.
2. Create a site token to access your protected site
POST an empty body to http://admin.hlx.page/config/{org}/sites/{site}/secrets.json the response will be a JSON object containing an id and value field. Remember both, you'll need them for the next steps:
Note that you now have two tokens:
The auth token for the admin API obtained during login. This one is highly sensitive and cannot be used for site authentication.
The site token, which you just created, which can be shared with users and systems than need to access your site
3. Enable the token to access your site
POST to http://admin.hlx.page/config/{org}/sites/{site}/access/site.json so that accessing your site on aem.page and aem.live requires the token value you've retrieved in the previous step.
The response contains the content of the access.site object. Each POST request overwrites that object, so if you want to update any content, make sure to perform a GET request to the same URL before and include the original content.
The example above sets the site property which controls access to both aem.page and aem.live. This is the most restrictive approach. If you want to limit access to both aem.page and aem.live, POST to .../access/site.json. If you want to limit access to aem.page only, post to .../access/preview.json. In the unlikely case that you want to limit access to aem.live only, and keep aem.page, post to .../access/live.json.
If you have set tokens for site and either preview or live, then preview and live will override the site-wide settings.
4. Verify that access has been limited
When you open your site in your browser, you will see an HTTP 401 status code, indicating that no access is possible without authentication. Next, try to access the site and provide the token value:
In this request we use the site token value in the Authorization header.
5. Make your CDN pass the right Authorization header
With this change, nobody can access your site without the correct authorization header. This includes your CDN, and therefore every visitor to your site. To enable access again, you need to add the Authorization header to each origin request your CDN makes.
The CDN setup instructions explain how to enable the authorization header for each supported Content Delivery Network.
Browser Access to the Protected Sites
Accessing protected sites directly from a browser requires users to have an appropriate role defined in the project configuration and to sign in using the AEM Sidekick Extension.
Example
The following excerpt of the access object of a site configuration for acme/website enforces the following:
Protects *--website--acme.aem.page
Allows to access *--website--acme.aem.page with a site token that has the id SGFsbG8gVG9iaWFz
Does not protect *--website--acme.aem.live
Enforces authentication of the admin API for acme/website
Allows sidekick authenticated users that have a *@acme.com email to preview, publish, etc.
Allows performing admin API operations with an admin token with the JWT jti 1kLvEvoipnINAOGDP8NVl3IYbJy2qmUQa5b1Fe23S7tt depending on the included scopes.

Upgrading to aem.live from hlx.live
As outlined on our deprecations and end-of-service page, the hlx.live domain will shut down December 18 2025. Fewer than two percent of daily traffic still flows through hlx.live, and the last dozen sites are already in active migration.
The AEM team has already reached out to you and is ready to guide your move. If your production site still points to hlx.live, migrate immediately to aem.live or risk an abrupt blackout when hlx.live retires.
If you are familiar with *.hlx.live for published content and *.hlx.page for previews, please note that we are introducing *.aem.live and *.aem.page as new domains for your sites.
With this change, we are also introducing several improvements while making sure everything works just as before. The most important benefit is that preview URLs will load faster on aem.page thanks to caching.
In this guide, we will walk you through the changes you'll need to make to upgrade to aem.live. Many of these steps are only required if you use specific features, so you may not need to complete all steps. Rest assured, the process is straightforward, and we are here to help you every step of the way.
Try your site on aem.live
Go to your site on hlx.live and replace hlx.live in the URL with aem.live. For instance, if you used to see your site on https://main--helix-website--adobe.hlx.live/ then your new URL would be https://main--helix-website--adobe.aem.live/. No more hlx.live, instead it's aem.live now.
Try previews on aem.page
If your site works on aem.live, then previews will also work on aem.page. For instance, if you used to see your site on https://main--helix-website--adobe.hlx.page/ then your new URL would be https://main--helix-website--adobe.aem.page/.
Tell Sidekick to use aem.live and aem.page
Even though both hlx.page and aem.page work for previews now, Sidekick will always default to hlx.page.
Let's change this. In your Sharepoint or Google Drive folder, locate the .helix/config spreadsheet and add following values, replacing <owner with your GitHub organization and <repo> with your repository name:
cdn.live.host: main--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live
cdn.preview.host: main--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page
Preview the spreadsheet using Sidekick to activate the new configuration.After activating the configuration, please make sure the Sidekick preview action is opening urls with .aem.page.
Point your CDN to aem.live
In your CDN setup, change the origin URL or host name from hlx.live to aem.live and activate the change. If you experience any issues, then revert the origin URL or host name back to hlx.live and contact Adobe for assistance.
We recommend to make the change in a lower environment such as stage before performing it in production environment
That's it, you made it! Your site is now on aem.live. For 95% of all sites, this is all you have to do. Keep reading for the remaining 5% of special cases.
If you need help during the upgrade or ran into issues, please join our Discord channel or get in touch with us to discuss further.
Advanced Upgrade Scenarios
If you are using BYO DNS without BYO CDN
If you use custom domains without a custom CDN, please contact Adobe to perform the origin change to aem.live.
If you are using hlx.page or hlx.live urls in your code
Check your GitHub repository for any references to hlx.page or hlx.live. If you find them, double-check the functionality, as the changed hostname may introduce CORS or other cross-origin issues. Update the references to aem.page or aem.live.
Code references to hlx.page and hlx.live in the sampleRUM() function, lib-franklin.js or aem.js do not need to be changed.
If you are using hlx.page or hlx.live in your content
Check your content repository for any instances where you might have references for hlx.page or hlx.live in any content areas, including spreadsheets, for project-specific functionality.
Update link references around project documentation areas that may include, but not limited to, Block Library, Runbooks, Authoring Guides, and Pull Request Templates.
We don't need to update in-content or absolute links/hrefs pointing to hlx.page or hlx.live in the Word documents, as they will be auto-transformed to aem.page and aem.live.
If you use the deprecated forms endpoint to receive form posts in Excel or Google Sheets
The forms service on hlx.live has been deprecated and will not be supported on aem.live. Please contact Adobe to discuss possible alternatives for this service.
If you have configured external services to use hlx.page or hlx.live
Many services like Google reCaptcha, Google Maps, Cloudflare Turnstile, etc. use the site domain or referrer domain to validate API tokens. If you have configured these services to allow your site on hlx.page or hlx.live, make sure to also allow aem.page and aem.live
If you want to update aem.js, too
Upgrading to aem.live does not require code changes. Some teams use the opportunity to also update to the latest version of aem.js. It's best to treat this as a separate upgrade and (like all code changes) test it on a separate branch.

A high-five for aem.live
If you've been using Adobe Experience Manager for a short while, you may have wondered what the hlx.live and hlx.page in the preview and live URLs of your site mean. If you have been using AEM for a longer while, you may have wondered when *.hlx.live would follow the steps of aem up, www.aem.live, and AEM Sidekick.
Today is the day we make the switch. I'm happy to announce that hlx.live is now aem.live and this transition brings several new changes that will improve your experience:
New Domains: your site is now available under *.aem.live and previews are on *.aem.page
Improved Performance: Previews on *.aem.page are a bit faster than on *.hlx.page, thanks to better caching
More and better stuff: aem.live enables advanced features such as centralized configurations, repoless sites, and more secure authentication
Starting today, all new projects created from the tutorial, will use the new aem.live architecture. Existing projects can upgrade following these steps.
AEM Live has been in development for nearly a year and in production for over six months. With more than 25% of our traffic now handled by aem.live, it’s proven itself ready for your site’s upgrade and your site will be in good company.
Speaking of good company, Joe Doherty, director of web development at The Channel Company shared this anecdote with us: "We've been running on aem.live since we heard about it on the AEM Discord channel a few months ago. When the business asked us to spin up an entirely new regional site with an unheard-of deadline of just four weeks, other teams would have balked at the challenge. With aem.live and repoless sites, we were able to meet that demand and help our business grow."
Edge Delivery Services for Adobe Experience Manager Sites as a Cloud Service started more than five years ago with Project Helix, and the acronym hlx could be found by our early adopters all over the place: in domains, user names, command line tools, and so on. With aem.live as the default, the name Helix is back to being an internal designator of the architecture version and the hlx.live and hlx.page domain names will see an eventual end of service.
Ready to make the switch? Upgrade your existing projects to aem.live today and start enjoying faster performance, advanced features, and a seamless AEM experience. For detailed instructions on how to upgrade, visit our upgrade guide or reach out to our team for assistance.

Custom domains without a custom CDN
The most common way of going live with a AEM site is to use a custom Content Delivery Network (CDN). Our documentation provides instructions for the most common CDN providers and through your Slack support channel, the AEM team provides assistance.
If you do not have a CDN, we can provide you with assistance in setting up a custom domain without a CDN.
Prerequisites and limitations
You must own the domain under which you want to serve your site
You need to be able to make Domain Name System (DNS) changes to the domain name
Adobe will provide you with a TLS certificate, and you do not have a choice in certificate authority to use
You will be able to establish a redirect from https://example.com to https://www.example.com but all other redirects must happen through the redirects spreadsheet
HTTPS is required and IPv6 is not supported
Before you go live
Reach out to the Adobe team in your dedicated Slack channel and tell them which domain (e.g. www.example.com) you want to use and which site (e.g. https://main–example–hlxsites.aem.live) should be the content source.
The Adobe team will verify the request and tell you when you are ready for the next step. This will usually take a few hours and might take up to one business day.
Setup push invalidation
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the managed CDN whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
Configuration properties:
After making changes to the config sheet, preview it with the sidekick to activate the changes.
Authorize the creation of the domain validation (DV) Certificate through ACME Challenge
This ensures that the domain validation certificate is available before any traffic is directed to the CDN.
Create a CNAME as below (aka ACME DNS challenge ) to authorize the creation of the DV Certificate
_acme-challenge.<your-domain-name> CNAME <challenge-value>
For e.g.
_acme-challenge.example.com CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com
The “challenge value” would be provided to you by the AEM team.
Once the above is done, execute dig command as below
$ dig _acme-challenge.example.com
And ensure that it responds with
_acme-challenge.example.com. 19454 IN CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.
If you got the response as above, you can skip the “Special Note“ below.
Note: Once the DV Certificate challenge has been created, customers have 7 days to create the validation CNAME. If not done within 7 days, then the Adobe team needs to retry the certificate issue process after the validation CNAME is created.
Special Note for DNS providers that require a trailing period (.)
Some but not all DNS providers require that a period (.) is added to the end of a target DNS to indicate that it is not local to the DNS Zone where the CNAME is being added.
dig and nslookup also add a . to the end of a domain reported to show it is fully qualified and not in the context of the zone being queried.
For instance, if we say we need a CNAME like the one below, we are using Full FQDNS (as you would see in a http url)
_acme-challenge.example.com CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com
We expect it to be added so that
$dig _acme-challenge.example.com
responds with
_acme-challenge.example.com. 19454 IN CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.
And not…
_acme-challenge.example.com. 19454 IN CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.example.com.
(here the record was added to the DNS provider with no trailing period (.) after example-acme-server.com and hence the DNS provider assumed the target was local to the zone, i.e. example.com.... which makes no sense for an ACME DNS challenge)
To handle such situations, where your DNS provider requires you to add a trailing period (.), create a CNAME record as below:
_acme-challenge.example.com. CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.
Observe the trailing period (.) in the example above.
Retry the dig command as follows
$dig _acme-challenge.example.com
And ensure that now it responds as expected with
_acme-challenge.example.com. 19454 IN CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.
Optionally lowering TTL of existing DNS records in preparation of going live for faster roll-out
If your existing DNS records for the domain which is set to go live, have a long TTL (like 12 hours or more), then for faster roll-out of the site once it is live, you may want to set it to a lower TTL (like 1 hour or maybe even as low as 60 seconds). This ensures that after going live, the traffic starts getting routed to the new site faster instead of waiting for the original TTL to expire. Do remember to restore the TTL back to the original value while updating the DNS records for going live.
As you go live
Make or request following DNS change:
For www.example.com set the CNAME DNS record to hlxcdn.adobeaemcloud.com
Use a high time to live (TTL) of 3600 seconds (one hour) or more. This will increase the reliability of site delivery in case of a DNS outage. If you lowered the TTL value for faster roll-out in preparation of going live, restore it to its original longer value.
If you want to establish an automatic redirect from from https://example.com to https://www.example.com the following additional steps are required
For example.com set the A record to these four IP addresses: 151.101.2.117, 151.101.66.117, 151.101.130.117, and 151.101.194.117
If your DNS provider cannot support multiple IP addresses in an A record (e.g. GoDaddy), use any of the listed IP addresses. This will be a bit less reliable, but won’t matter
Use the same high TTL as described above
Depending on your existing DNS setup including the TTL specified in the DNS records, these changes can take a few minutes to several hours to complete. If you have existing traffic on the site, make sure all redirects are in place or keep your existing site functional till the traffic has completely been redirected to the new site, which is essentially waiting out for the duration of the TTL in the DNS records to expire.
The certificates are issued automatically after you have successfully set up the ACME challenge as explained in the “Authorize the creation of the DV Certificate through ACME Challenge” section above.
Please note that if you are hosting both APEX and the www domains they both need to have the DNS configured for the certificate to be generated.
If you are looking for a timed launch, it is a good idea to create a temporary holding home page that will be replaced with the correct content at the desired launch time. As publishing in AEM is fast and predictable, this will give you more control over the visibility of your content than relying on DNS.
After you go live
The AEM team will verify your setup and let you know if any problems arise.

The setup described in this walk-through requires the Enterprise plan. If you want to use another plan (incl. Free plan), please follow the instructions here.
Setup push invalidation for Cloudflare
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is configured by adding specific properties to the project's configuration:
If you are using the configuration service, see here how to update the CDN configuration.
Otherwise, see here for document-based CDN configuration.
Configuration properties:
values: free, pro, business, enterprise
default: free
To create an API Token,
go to API Tokens

Zone Resources: "Include", "Specific zone", "<your production zone>"
click on "Continue to summary"
click on "Create Token",
copy the generated token value.
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
DNS Setup
Select DNS in the left pane:
Click on Add record to add a CNAME record. Enter the value to the hostname of your AEM Live origin (e.g. main--mysite--hlxsites.hlx.live) in the Target field.
Make sure the CNAME record is Proxied.
SSL/TLS Setup
Select SSL/TLS from the left pane and Edge Certificates in the dropdown list:
On the right side, scroll down to Always Use HTTPS and enable it:
Configure Caching
Create Page Rule
The result should look like this:
Create Transform Rules
Choose Transform Rules in the left pane, click on Create transform rule and select Modify Request Header:
Enter a name (e.g. Required AEM headers) and complete the form as follows (replace www.mydomain.com with your domain):
NB: The X-Push-Invalidation: enabled request header enables the AEM push invalidation including long cache TTLs. Make sure you have successfully configured push invalidation for your project.
Now, similarly, add a Modify Response Header rule:
After completing all steps you should be all set.

Manual Forms Sheet Setup
This document explains how to manually set up your sheet for use with the forms service.
Note: If you are creating the headers manually the header names should exactly match the name of the properties in the form data.
Manual header creation in Excel
To manually set up your sheet in excel, first create a Table on the ‘incoming’ sheet by clicking the Table button under the Insert menu in Excel.
Change the heading of each column in the table to match the properties in your data. To create more columns right click the table and select ‘Table Columns to the Left’ from the Insert menu.
The name of the table must be set to ‘intake_form’. To change the name of the table select it and then choose ‘Table Design’ from the top menu bar.
Then change the name of the table from ‘Table1’ to ‘intake_form’.
You should also create a new sheet in the workbook called ‘helix-default’, the data in this sheet is what will be returned when you make a GET request to your sheet. This is a great place to use formulas in spreadsheets to summarize the data from the `incoming` sheet.
Note: The `helix-default` sheet should never contain any personally identifiable information or other data you are not ok with being publicly accessible.
If you would like to get notifications in slack when data is ingested you will need to create another sheet called ‘slack’. In this sheet you will need to create another Table called ‘slack with the following columns.
For details on what values to enter in the slack table refer back to the Forms Service documentation.
Manual header creation in Google Sheets
To manually setup a Google Sheets just add the property names to the first row of the incoming sheet.
Note: You can add alternating row colors by holding down shift and selecting the column Ids (in the example above A and B) and then choosing Format -> Alternating colors from the top menu.
You should also create a new sheet in the workbook called ‘helix-default’, the data in this sheet is what will be returned by making a GET request to your sheet. This is a great place to use formulas in spreadsheets to summarize the data from the `incoming` sheet.
Note: The `helix-default` sheet should never contain any personally identifiable information or other data you are not ok with being publicly accessible.
If you would like to get notifications in slack you will need to create another sheet called ‘slack’, in this sheet you will need to create the following headers.
For details on what values to enter in the slack table refer back to the Forms Service documentation.

Forms
Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms is a composable set of services that enables a rapid development environment where authors can update, publish, and launch new forms rapidly. These services deliver exceptional and high impact forms experiences that drive engagement and conversions. These forms experiences are easy to author and develop.
These services enable you to:
Create forms with tools of your choice: Increase authoring efficiency by decoupling content sources. Out of the box you can use Document-based Authoring (Microsoft SharePoint or Google Drive), WYSIWYG Authoring (Universal Editor). You can work with multiple content sources on the same forms site and use your preferred authoring tools, such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Universal Editor to create a variety of forms, including Contact Us forms, Marketing forms, Enrollment forms, Business Process forms, and more.
Create forms optimized for speed, performance, and higher conversions: Deliver forms experiences that load and render quickly and continuously monitor your forms performance through real use monitoring (RUM). These forms offer perfect core web vitals which results in faster loading times and optimized user experience that contributes to higher form completion and conversion rates.
Use developer friendly toolset: Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms uses plain HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create exceptional forms experiences, avoiding the steep learning curve of a specific framework. A developer with basic web development skills can customize and easily build form components and forms experiences. There is no need to wait for a pipeline to run, just check-in your code into GitHub and your changes are live.
Use Forms Submission Service: The Forms Submission Service lets you save form submissions directly to spreadsheets like OneDrive, SharePoint, or Google Sheets, even if the spreadsheet isn’t managed by Edge Delivery Services.
Note: To use form-related capabilities on your Edge Delivery Services Site, a valid AEM Forms license is required. Refer to the Product Description for licensing details.
Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms allows for a high degree of flexibility in how you author forms on your website. You can author content and forms with WYSIWYG Authoring as well as Document-based Authoring. Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms provide a forms block, known as Adaptive Forms Block to add a form to your Edge Delivery Services site.
For example, you author forms directly in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets and these spreadsheets are transformed into forms for your website. Any new form or form content, such as a new form field, is instantly available on your website without requiring a rebuild process.
The following diagram illustrates how you can edit forms in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets (Document-based Authoring) and publish to Edge Delivery Services. It also shows the AEM publishing method using the WYSIWYG Authoring (Universal Editor)
Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms uses GitHub so customers can manage and deploy code directly from their GitHub repository. For example, you can write forms in either Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel and the components of your forms can be developed by using CSS and JavaScript in a GitHub repository.
When your forms are ready, you can use the AEM Sidekick, a chrome browser extension, to preview and publish content updates.
The choice between Document-based Authoring and WYSIWYG Authoring depends on your needs: Use Document-based Authoring for simple, spreadsheet-like forms with basic fields and quick data connectivity, while WYSIWYG Authoring is ideal for complex forms requiring multiple panels, business logic, data integration, and AEM workflows.
Key Features of Document-based Authoring and WYSIWYG Authoring
Document-based Authoring offers a basic set of features and WYSIWYG Authoring unlocks additional capabilities beyond the Document-based Authoring, empowering you to build more complex and interactive forms. The key features of both Document-based Authoring and WYSIWYG Authoring are:

Using the AEM Sidekick (v6)
​​The AEM sidekick provides content authors with a toolbar offering context-aware options so that they can edit, preview, and publish their content directly from the pages of your website.
This document explains how to use the sidekick.
Installation
Please see the document Installing the AEM Sidekick for how to install and configure the sidekick.
Using the Sidekick
The sidekick can be invoked in the following contexts:
Within project environments
Within online editors (depending on your project setup) to edit your content
Google Docs/Sheets
Microsoft Word/Excel
Google Docs/Sheets
Microsoft Word/Excel
To use the sidekick extension, navigate to a URL associated with your project. This can be one of the following:
A SharePoint or Google document (desktop only)
A Preview URL (the domain name ending in .aem.page)
A Live URL (the domain name ending in .aem.live)
A production URL (the domain name being your project’s public host name). Note: This requires adding the project to your configuration
The sidekick extension can be toggled by clicking the Adobe Experience Cloud icon next to the address bar.
Adding Projects
Adding projects to your sidekick configuration is optional for most use cases. The sidekick is able to auto-detect if a URL is associated with your project. If you want the sidekick to also recognize custom domains, such as your project’s production domain, you’ll need to persist the project in your sidekick configuration by clicking the + button on the right hand side..
Environment Switcher
The environment switcher on a sidekick in Google Docs.
When using document-based authoring to create content, content moves from the editor through different environments. The environment switcher allows you to easily jump around between them.
Preview
This option takes you to the preview environment, which reflects the latest changes of the page rendered from the source document. You can also send preview URLs to stakeholders so they can review your content before it gets published. Note that this option is only enabled if the content you are looking at has been previewed before.
The preview URL follows the pattern https://branch--repo--org.aem.page/path.
branch, repo and org identify the location of your project’s underlying code in GitHub
/path corresponds to the location of the content in Google Drive or OneDrive, starting from the root folder.
A / at the end of a path refers to the index document in a folder.
Live
This option is only available if there is not yet a production environment. It shows the published content and serves as a stand-in (and the origin) for your project’s production environment. Note that this option is only enabled if the content you are looking at has been published before.
The live URL looks almost identical to the preview URL, the only difference being in the 1st level domain: https://main--repo--org.aem.live/path
Production
This option takes you to the production environment, which is your project’s public-facing website. Note that this option may not be available during the development stage of your project or because the content has not been published yet.
This environment can be a 3rd-party or “bring your own” CDN. Depending on the project setup, new content may only appear after a delay.
If your public-facing domain name is yourproject.com, the production URL would be https://yourproject.com/path
Actions
There are a number of actions that you can take on your content by conveniently using the sidekick toolbar. Actions that have not been executed since the content was last changed are badged with an orange indicator.
Preview
\ The preview action on a sidekick in Google Docs.
Preview is the predominant action in the editor. It (re)generates the preview page based on the current document and opens it in a separate tab.
Edit
The Edit action is available in all three environments. It opens the online editor of the current page’s source document in a separate window.
The sidekick in a preview environment.
At a minimum read access to the document in Google Drive or OneDrive is required to use this action.
Reload
The Reload action is available in the preview environment only. It can be used to force a content refresh, for example if you have editor and preview open side by side while working on the content. The action is identical to the Preview action in the editor.
Publish
The Publish action is available in all three environments and makes the current preview version of the page available in the live and production environments.
The sidekick in a live environment.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Bulk Actions
Open the sidekick in Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint and select one or more files to bulk preview and publish files and conveniently copy their URLs. You can also use this feature to preview and publish media like SVG or PDF files.
Adobe continues to extend the support for file formats that can be published directly from your content source (SharePoint or GDrive) based on popular use and security considerations. Currently the supported formats include: PDF, SVG, JPG, PNG.
Formats that are under consideration for being added include: XML, MP4 as well as raw DOCX, XLSX, PPTX without transformation.
Limitation: in Microsoft SharePoint, larger selections (more than 60) may not be fully exposed to the sidekick and may therefore need to be split into smaller badges.
Bulk Preview
Selecting multiple documents in SharePoint or GDrive allows you to preview multiple documents en masse.
Bulk preview in Google Drive.
Bulk Publish
Selecting multiple documents in SharePoint or GDrive allows you to publish multiple documents en masse.
Bulk publish in Google Drive..
Copy URLs
Use this feature to copy the preview, live or production URLs of one or multiple files.
Unpublishing Content
If you need to remove content from your website, the first thing to do is to delete, rename, or move the underlying source document in Google Docs or OneDrive.
For a page without a source document (i.e. it was renamed or moved), the sidekick will show the following two actions when invoked in the preview environment.
Note: If you are signed in to the sidekick, you can skip deleting the underlying source document and simply hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key to bring up the Delete and Unpublish actions.
The sidekick on a preview page without a source document.
Delete
The Delete action will permanently delete the page from all environments, implicitly unpublishing it.
Unpublish
This Unpublish action will unpublish the page, but still keep it in the preview environment for reference.
See the document Authoring and Publishing Content for more information about deleting content.
Caution: The Delete and Unpublish actions cannot be undone! Double-check the URL and page content to make sure it is really OK to delete and/or unpublish a page. The source document may have been moved accidentally and may not need to be deleted.
Sharing the Sidekick
You can share the sidekick configuration for your project by clicking the share symbol at the top right. This will copy a shareable URL to your clipboard and allow you to paste it in a DM or email to a colleague. The share URL will enable the recipient to effortlessly install the sidekick for your project.
See the document Installing the AEM Sidekick for more information.
Customizing the Sidekick
If you are a developer, you can customize the sidekick for your project.

https://www.aem.live/docs/scheduling

Scheduling
AEM offers a way to execute certain tasks, such as previewing, publishing or purging pages at certain times during the day or in certain periodic intervals. It also allows publishing a query index, which makes entries public in the JSON representation that may have only been available in the underlying Excel workbook or Google spreadsheet.The tasks to execute and the time they should be executed at are configurable with a crontab sheet, located in the project’s .helix folder, that looks as follows:
The sheet should have two columns named when and command, containing time and command to execute.
Specifying time
The scheduled time is specified as a text expression and times are expressed in UTC. Some examples follow:
at 7:00 amRuns at 07:00 UTC every day.
every 60 minutes starting on the 55th minRuns every hour on the 55th minute
at 3:00 pm on the 18th day of May in 2024Runs exactly once at 15:00 UTC on 18 May 2024
Note the year in the last example. If this is omitted, you schedule a job that runs again on the same date next year:
at 3:00 pm on the 18th day of MayRuns every year at 15:00 UTC on 18 May
Also note that the background scheduler only runs every 5 minutes, at :00, :05, :10 and so on, which means that scheduling a job to be executed before the next scheduler run will not work. For example, if it’s 3:01 pm, and you schedule a job to be executed at 3:04 pm, the next scheduler run at 3:05 pm will consider 3:04 pm a time in the past and therefore not execute that job.
For more information on supported time expressions, see later’s documentation page.
Available tasks
The following table summarizes the tasks available:
The complete reference to those tasks can be found below.
Activate your schedule configuration
When you are finished making changes to your crontab sheet, activate it by previewing it. If there are any syntactical errors, a message will be displayed, and none of your tasks in that sheet will be scheduled.
Run multiple tasks at the same time
You can run multiple tasks at the same time by separating them with a line feed in the cell. If you happen to have a lot of pages to preview, publish and possibly purge at the same time, consider using process as shown below.
Task reference
preview
Preview a page given as second parameter, e.g.preview /documentpreview /spreadsheet.json
publish
Publish a page given as second parameter, e.g.publish /documentpublish /spreadsheet.json
http
Execute a HTTP request to the given URL, with an optional method, e.g.http https://www.example.comhttp GET https://www.example.com
both issue a GET request to https://www.example.com
publish-index
Publish an index and additionally rebuild the sitemap if there were changes, e.g.publish-index default publishes the index named default in helix-query.yaml.
publish-snaphot
Publish a snapshot given as second parameter, e.g.publish-snapshot 1234
process
Process a previewed JSON document line by line, interpreting it as a list of commands and their arguments, where the columns are commands and the cell values are arguments.For example, given the following JSON document called /tasks.json:
Adding a command process /tasks.json to your crontab will preview and publish /document1, and then preview and publish /document2.
unpublish
Unpublish a page given as second parameter, e.g.unpublish /documentunpublish /spreadsheet.json

Custom domains without a custom CDN
The most common way of going live with a AEM site is to use a custom Content Delivery Network (CDN). Our documentation provides instructions for the most common CDN providers and through your Slack support channel, the AEM team provides assistance.
If you do not have a CDN, we can provide you with assistance in setting up a custom domain without a CDN.
Prerequisites and limitations
You must own the domain under which you want to serve your site
You need to be able to make Domain Name System (DNS) changes to the domain name
Adobe will provide you with a TLS certificate, and you do not have a choice in certificate authority to use
You will be able to establish a redirect from https://example.com to https://www.example.com but all other redirects must happen through the redirects spreadsheet
HTTPS is required and IPv6 is not supported
Before you go live
Reach out to the Adobe team in your dedicated Slack channel and tell them which domain (e.g. www.example.com) you want to use and which site (e.g. https://main–example–hlxsites.aem.live) should be the content source.
The Adobe team will verify the request and tell you when you are ready for the next step. This will usually take a few hours and might take up to one business day.
Setup push invalidation
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the managed CDN whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
Configuration properties:
After making changes to the config sheet, preview it with the sidekick to activate the changes.
Authorize the creation of the domain validation (DV) Certificate through ACME Challenge
This ensures that the domain validation certificate is available before any traffic is directed to the CDN.
Create a CNAME as below (aka ACME DNS challenge ) to authorize the creation of the DV Certificate
_acme-challenge.<your-domain-name> CNAME <challenge-value>
For e.g.
_acme-challenge.example.com CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com
The “challenge value” would be provided to you by the AEM team.
Once the above is done, execute dig command as below
$ dig _acme-challenge.example.com
And ensure that it responds with
_acme-challenge.example.com. 19454 IN CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.
If you got the response as above, you can skip the “Special Note“ below.
Note: Once the DV Certificate challenge has been created, customers have 7 days to create the validation CNAME. If not done within 7 days, then the Adobe team needs to retry the certificate issue process after the validation CNAME is created.
Special Note for DNS providers that require a trailing period (.)
Some but not all DNS providers require that a period (.) is added to the end of a target DNS to indicate that it is not local to the DNS Zone where the CNAME is being added.
dig and nslookup also add a . to the end of a domain reported to show it is fully qualified and not in the context of the zone being queried.
For instance, if we say we need a CNAME like the one below, we are using Full FQDNS (as you would see in a http url)
_acme-challenge.example.com CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com
We expect it to be added so that
$dig _acme-challenge.example.com
responds with
_acme-challenge.example.com. 19454 IN CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.
And not…
_acme-challenge.example.com. 19454 IN CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.example.com.
(here the record was added to the DNS provider with no trailing period (.) after example-acme-server.com and hence the DNS provider assumed the target was local to the zone, i.e. example.com.... which makes no sense for an ACME DNS challenge)
To handle such situations, where your DNS provider requires you to add a trailing period (.), create a CNAME record as below:
_acme-challenge.example.com. CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.
Observe the trailing period (.) in the example above.
Retry the dig command as follows
$dig _acme-challenge.example.com
And ensure that now it responds as expected with
_acme-challenge.example.com. 19454 IN CNAME random-value.example-acme-server.com.
Optionally lowering TTL of existing DNS records in preparation of going live for faster roll-out
If your existing DNS records for the domain which is set to go live, have a long TTL (like 12 hours or more), then for faster roll-out of the site once it is live, you may want to set it to a lower TTL (like 1 hour or maybe even as low as 60 seconds). This ensures that after going live, the traffic starts getting routed to the new site faster instead of waiting for the original TTL to expire. Do remember to restore the TTL back to the original value while updating the DNS records for going live.
As you go live
Make or request following DNS change:
For www.example.com set the CNAME DNS record to hlxcdn.adobeaemcloud.com
Use a high time to live (TTL) of 3600 seconds (one hour) or more. This will increase the reliability of site delivery in case of a DNS outage. If you lowered the TTL value for faster roll-out in preparation of going live, restore it to its original longer value.
If you want to establish an automatic redirect from from https://example.com to https://www.example.com the following additional steps are required
For example.com set the A record to these four IP addresses: 151.101.2.117, 151.101.66.117, 151.101.130.117, and 151.101.194.117
If your DNS provider cannot support multiple IP addresses in an A record (e.g. GoDaddy), use any of the listed IP addresses. This will be a bit less reliable, but won’t matter
Use the same high TTL as described above
Depending on your existing DNS setup including the TTL specified in the DNS records, these changes can take a few minutes to several hours to complete. If you have existing traffic on the site, make sure all redirects are in place or keep your existing site functional till the traffic has completely been redirected to the new site, which is essentially waiting out for the duration of the TTL in the DNS records to expire.
The certificates are issued automatically after you have successfully set up the ACME challenge as explained in the “Authorize the creation of the DV Certificate through ACME Challenge” section above.
Please note that if you are hosting both APEX and the www domains they both need to have the DNS configured for the certificate to be generated.
If you are looking for a timed launch, it is a good idea to create a temporary holding home page that will be replaced with the correct content at the desired launch time. As publishing in AEM is fast and predictable, this will give you more control over the visibility of your content than relying on DNS.
After you go live
The AEM team will verify your setup and let you know if any problems arise.

Forms
Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms is a composable set of services that enables a rapid development environment where authors can update, publish, and launch new forms rapidly. These services deliver exceptional and high impact forms experiences that drive engagement and conversions. These forms experiences are easy to author and develop.
These services enable you to:
Create forms with tools of your choice: Increase authoring efficiency by decoupling content sources. Out of the box you can use Document-based Authoring (Microsoft SharePoint or Google Drive), WYSIWYG Authoring (Universal Editor). You can work with multiple content sources on the same forms site and use your preferred authoring tools, such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Universal Editor to create a variety of forms, including Contact Us forms, Marketing forms, Enrollment forms, Business Process forms, and more.
Create forms optimized for speed, performance, and higher conversions: Deliver forms experiences that load and render quickly and continuously monitor your forms performance through real use monitoring (RUM). These forms offer perfect core web vitals which results in faster loading times and optimized user experience that contributes to higher form completion and conversion rates.
Use developer friendly toolset: Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms uses plain HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create exceptional forms experiences, avoiding the steep learning curve of a specific framework. A developer with basic web development skills can customize and easily build form components and forms experiences. There is no need to wait for a pipeline to run, just check-in your code into GitHub and your changes are live.
Use Forms Submission Service: The Forms Submission Service lets you save form submissions directly to spreadsheets like OneDrive, SharePoint, or Google Sheets, even if the spreadsheet isn’t managed by Edge Delivery Services.
Note: To use form-related capabilities on your Edge Delivery Services Site, a valid AEM Forms license is required. Refer to the Product Description for licensing details.
Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms allows for a high degree of flexibility in how you author forms on your website. You can author content and forms with WYSIWYG Authoring as well as Document-based Authoring. Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms provide a forms block, known as Adaptive Forms Block to add a form to your Edge Delivery Services site.
For example, you author forms directly in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets and these spreadsheets are transformed into forms for your website. Any new form or form content, such as a new form field, is instantly available on your website without requiring a rebuild process.
The following diagram illustrates how you can edit forms in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets (Document-based Authoring) and publish to Edge Delivery Services. It also shows the AEM publishing method using the WYSIWYG Authoring (Universal Editor)
Edge Delivery Services for AEM Forms uses GitHub so customers can manage and deploy code directly from their GitHub repository. For example, you can write forms in either Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel and the components of your forms can be developed by using CSS and JavaScript in a GitHub repository.
When your forms are ready, you can use the AEM Sidekick, a chrome browser extension, to preview and publish content updates.
The choice between Document-based Authoring and WYSIWYG Authoring depends on your needs: Use Document-based Authoring for simple, spreadsheet-like forms with basic fields and quick data connectivity, while WYSIWYG Authoring is ideal for complex forms requiring multiple panels, business logic, data integration, and AEM workflows.
Key Features of Document-based Authoring and WYSIWYG Authoring
Document-based Authoring offers a basic set of features and WYSIWYG Authoring unlocks additional capabilities beyond the Document-based Authoring, empowering you to build more complex and interactive forms. The key features of both Document-based Authoring and WYSIWYG Authoring are:
Document-based Authoring features
Document-based Authoring allows you to create forms using familiar tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. These forms offer the following functionalities:
Accessible components for a user-friendly experience.
Standardized HTML structure for consistent rendering.
Rules and validations to ensure data accuracy.
File attachment options for collecting additional information.
Ability to create custom form components for specific needs.
Submit form data directly to Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets or email addresses.
Monitor your forms performance through real use monitoring (RUM).
WYSIWYG Authoring features
WYSIWYG Authoring provides WYSIWYG interfaces (Universal Editor) for building forms and offers all the capabilities of Document-based Authoring, plus a wide range of additional features:
Advanced rules editor for creating complex logic.
Server-side extensibility for custom functionalities.
WYSIWYG editing experience for easy form creation and visualization.
Document of record functionality to create tamper-proof archives of submitted data.
Google reCAPTCHA integration for spam protection.

The Anatomy of a Project
This document describes what a typical project should look like from a code standpoint. Before reading this document, please familiarize yourself with the document Getting Started - Developer Tutorial.
Git and GitHub
One of our defining philosophies is that it is easiest to allow users to work with the tools that they are familiar with. The overwhelming majority of developers manage their code in systems based on Git, so it only makes sense to allow developers to work with Git to manage and deploy their code.
We are using a buildless approach that runs directly from your GitHub repo. After installing the AEM GitHub bot on your repo, websites are automatically created for each of your branches for content preview on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/ and the production site on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live/ for published content.
Every resource that you put into your GitHub repo is available on your website, so a file in your GitHub repo on the main branch in /scripts/scripts.js will be available on https://main--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/scripts/scripts.jsThis should be very intuitive. There are few “special” files that Adobe Experience Manager uses to connect the content into your website.
We strongly recommend that repos are kept public on GitHub, to foster the community. For a public facing website there really is no need to keep the code hidden, as it is being served to the browsers of your website.
Important notes:
The combination <branch>--<repo>--<owner> must not exceed 63 characters (including the hyphens/dashes). This is a subdomain name constraint.
branch, repo and owner cannot contain --.
Configuration Files
There are some files in your GitHub repo that have a special meaning to AEM and are processed in a special fashion. These files are in the root directory of your repo.
The Content Connection: fstab.yaml
As you may have seen in the getting started guide the fstab.yaml file serves as the connection to your Google Drive or SharePoint folders that contain your content. This file is used as an indicator for how the code in your GitHub repo gets combined with the content in your content source.
Beyond providing the connection to the content, the fstab.yaml also provides a folder mapping facility that allows you map extensionless “routes” to a given piece of content or static HTML.
The Entry Point: head.html
The head.html file is the most important extension point to influence the markup of the content. The easiest way to think of it is that this file is injected on the server side as part of the <head> HTML tag and is combined with the metadata coming from the content.
The head.html should remain largely unchanged from the boilerplate and there are only very few legitimate reasons in a regular project to make changes. Those include remapping your project to a different base URL for the purposes of exposing your project in a different folder than the root folder of your domain on your CDN or to support legacy browsers which usually require scripts that are not loaded as modules.
Adding marketing technology like Adobe Web SDK, Google Tag Manager or other 3rd party scripts to your head.html file is strongly advised against due to performance impacts. Adding inline scripts or styles to head.html is also not advisable for performance and code management reasons, see the section Scripts and Styles below for more information about handling scripts and styles.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/helix-project-boilerplate/blob/main/head.html
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/head.html
https://github.com/adobe/business-website/blob/main/head.html
Not Found: 404.html
To create a custom 404 response, place a 404.html file into the root of your github repository. This will be served on any URL that doesn’t map to an existing resource in either content or code, and replaces the body of the out of the box minimalist 404 response.
The 404 can mimic the markup of an existing page including your code for the site, with navigation footers etc., or it can have a completely different appearance.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/hlxsites/bamboohr-website/blob/main/404.html See in Action
https://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/404.html See in Action
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/404.html See in Action
Don’t Serve: .hlxignore
There are some files in your repo that should not be served from your website, either because you would like to keep them private or they are not relevant to the delivery of the website (e.g. tests, build tools, build artifacts, etc.) and don’t need to be observed by the AEM bot. You can add those to a .hlxignore file in the same format as the well-known .gitignore file.
Please see the following example.
https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/.hlxignore
Tame the Bots: robots.txt
A robots.txt file is generally a regular file that is served as you would expect on your production website on your own domain. To protect your preview and origin site from being indexed, your .page and .live sites will serve a robots.txt file that disallows all robots instead of the robots.txt file from your repo.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/robots.txt
https://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/robots.txt
https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/robots.txt
Query and Indexing: helix-query.yaml
There is a flexible indexing facility that lets you keep track of all of your content pages conveniently as a spreadsheet. This facility is often used to show lists or feeds of pages as well as to filter and sort content on a website. Please see the document Indexing for more information.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
Automate Your Sitemap: helix-sitemap.yaml
Complex sitemaps can automatically be created for you whenever authors publish new content, including flexible hreflang mappings where needed. This functionality is usually based on the indexing facility.See this GitHub issue for sitemap configuration options.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/fedpub/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
Commonly Used File and Folder Structure
Beyond the files treats as special or configuration files, there is a commonly-used structure that is expressed in the Boilerplate repo.
The common folders below are usually in the root directory of a project repo, but in cases where only a portion of a website is handled by AEM, they are often moved to a subfolder to reflect the mapping of the route of the origin in a CDN.
This means that in a case where for example only /en/blog/ is initially mapped to AEM from the CDN, all the folder structures below (eg. /scripts, /styles, /blocks etc.) are moved into a the /en/blog/ folder in GitHub to keep the CDN mapping as simple as possible.
With a simple adjustment of the reference to scripts.js and styles.css in head.html (see above) it is possible to indicate that all the necessary files are loaded from the respective code base directory. To avoid url rewriting the folder structure is also created the content source (eg. sharepoint or google drive) by having a directory structure of /en/blog/.In many cases as the AEM footprint grows on a site there is a point in time when the code gets moved back to the root folder and the head.html references are adjusted accordingly.
Scripts and Styles
By convention in a AEM project, the head.html references styles.css, scripts.js, and aem.js located in /scripts and /styles, as the entry points for the project code.
scripts.js is where your global custom javascript code lives and is where the block loading code is triggered. styles.css hosts the global styling information for your site, and minimally contains the global layout information that is needed to display the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).As all three files are loaded before the page can be displayed, it is important that they are kept relatively small and executed efficiently.Beyond styles.css, a lazy-styles.css file is commonly used, which is loaded after the LCP event, and therefore can contain slower/more CSS information. This could be a good place for fonts or global CSS that is below the fold.
In addition to scripts.js, there is the commonly-used delayed.js. This is a catch-all for libraries that need to be loaded on a page but should be kept from interfering with the delivery of the page. This is a good place for code that is outside of the control of your project and usually includes the martech stack and other libraries.
Please see the document Keeping it 100, Web Performance for more information about optimizing your site performance.
Blocks
Most of the project-specific CSS and JavaScript code lives in blocks. Authors create blocks in their documents. Developers then write the corresponding code that styles the blocks with CSS and/or decorates the DOM to take the markup of a block and transform it to the structure that’s needed or convenient for desired styling and functionality.
The block name is used as both the folder name of a block as well as the filename for the .css and .js files that are loaded by the block loader when a block is used on a page.
The block name is also used as the CSS class name on the block to allow for intuitive styling. The javascript is loaded as a module (ESM) and exports a default function that is executed as part of the block loading.
A simple example is the Columns Block. It adds additional classes in JavaScript based on how many columns are in the respective instance created by the author. This allows it to be able to use flexible styling of content that is in two columns vs. three columns.
Icons
Most projects have SVG files that are usually added to the /icons folder, and can be referenced with a :<iconname>: notation by authors. By default, icons are inlined into the DOM so they can be styled with CSS, without having to create SVG symbols.

Cloudflare Setup (worker) for hlx.live
NOTE: The instructions linked on this page apply to the previous version of Edge Delivery Services and are provided for customers who have not upgraded to aem.live yet. The current version of this document is provided here.
The following screenshots illustrate how to configure Cloudflare to deliver content. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
This setup can be completely done in the browser by using the Cloudflare Dashboard only. If you are already familiar with Cloudflare Workers, Wrangler & GitHub and not afraid of entering commands in a terminal window you might want to follow the instructions here instead.
Create a Cloudflare site
If you already have a cloudflare site and DNS setup you can skip forward to the Setup push invalidation section.
Enter the domain:
Select a plan:
Note that surgical push invalidations are only supported on the Enterprise plan. On all other plans the entire cache of the site will be purged every time an author publishes a content change.For this walk-through we’ll use the Free plan.
Setup push invalidation for Cloudflare
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is configured by adding specific properties to the project's configuration:
If you are using the configuration service, see here how to update the CDN configuration.
Otherwise, see here for document-based CDN configuration.
Configuration properties:
values: free, pro, business, enterprise
default: free
To create an API Token,
go to API Tokens
click on "Create Token",
go to "Create Custom Token" at the bottom and click on "Get started"
enter a token name (e.g. "Production Site Purge Token"),
Permissions: "Zone", "Cache Purge", "Purge"
Zone Resources: "Include", "Specific zone", "<your production zone>"
click on "Continue to summary"
click on "Create Token",
copy the generated token value.
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
DNS Setup
For a new site, we’ll start with a simple DNS setup.
Create a new CNAME record. If your zone is example.com and you want to serve traffic on www.example.com, then the name should be www
If you want to serve traffic on example.com (without a www) then the name should be @
And if you want to serve traffic on all subdomains, then the name should be * as in the screenshot below
As we are using workers to serve the content, the value of the Content field does not matter. It’s easiest to use your ref--repo--owner.hlx.live host name here. This is a hostname, not a URL, so leave out the leading https://
Make sure the CNAME record is Proxied:
SSL/TLS Setup
Select SSL/TLS from the left pane and Edge Certificates in the dropdown list:
On the right side, scroll down to Always Use HTTPS and enable it:
Configure Caching
Create Cache Rules
Note: Enable Origin Cache Control option is only available for enterprise accounts. Free, Pro, and Business customers have this option enabled by default and cannot disable it.
Create Worker
Choose Workers in the left pane and click on “Manage Workers”:
Click on “Create a Service”:
Enter a name for the worker (e.g. “helix-worker”) and click on “Create Service”:
Click on “Quick edit”:
Edit worker code
If you have successfully configured push invalidation copy the content of this file, otherwise copy the content of this file.
In the left pane, replace the existing content with the copied content.
Click on “Save and Deploy”:
Click on Settings and “Add variable”:
Add a variable ORIGIN_HOSTNAME and set the value to the hostname of your origin (e.g. main--mysite--hlxsites.hlx.live):
Click on Triggers an select “Add route”:
Enter your domain route (e.g. www.mydomain.com/*), select your zone and click on “Add route”:
Depending on the setup chosen in DNS Setup, you would select routes www.mydomain.com/*, mydomain.com/*, or *.mydomain.com/*After completing all steps you should be all set.
Expanding the AEM footprint on your website
In case you start with having only a portion of the website being routed to your .live origin and have routed a specific folder (eg. /blog/*) you can subsequently add more routes whenever you are ready to expose new sections of the site by simply adding more routes and repeat the last “add route” steps as needed, without changing your worker configuration.
Watch out for duplicate content
Search engines often penalize sites for duplicate content, so it's important to make sure your content is not available on the web elsewhere. Cloudflare, unfortunately, has a default setting that will expose your site on additional network ports. In paid Cloudflare plans you can block traffic on these additional ports. This is a recommended setting for production sites.

Akamai Setup for hlx.live
NOTE: The instructions linked on this page apply to the previous version of Edge Delivery Services and are provided for customers who have not upgraded to aem.live yet. The current version of this document is provided here.
The following screenshots illustrate how to use the Akamai Property Manager to configure a property to deliver content from AEM using your Akamai CDN setup. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
Essential Property settings
Origin Server
Configuration properties:
Add Behavior: Remove Vary Header
Configuration properties:
Add Behavior: Modify Outgoing Request Header
Configuration properties:
Add more outgoing request headers:
Configuration properties:
Configuration properties:
Add/Modify Behavior: Caching
Configuration properties:
Add Behavior: HTTP/2
(Optional, but recommended)
Add Rule: Modify Outgoing Response Header
Create a new rule
Set the criteria for the rule to be applied
Set the behavior if a match is found
These are all essential property settings for delivering content.
Caveats
Do not enable Akamai mPulse Real Usage Monitoring. While the performance impact on most sites is negligible, for sites built for consistent high performance, enabling it will prevent reaching a Lighthouse Score of 100. In AEM, you have a Real User Monitoring service built-in, so that dual instrumentation will be unnecessary and is strongly discouraged.
Also, do not enable Akamai Bot Manager or similar Web Application Firewall offerings, as they markedly interfere with rendering performance and user experience. Your site on AEM is protected against bot attacks on the backend, so that this performance cost comes with negligible benefit.
Setup push invalidation for Akamai
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
Configuration properties:
AEM push invalidation uses the Akamai Fast Purge API, specifically Delete by URL and Delete by cache tag.
The Fast Purge API credentials consist of
They can be generated by following the instructions at Create an API client with custom permissions.
Go to Identity & Access Management:
Create API client:
Required group/role permissions:
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
Special Mention - Akamai Edge-Control Headers
AEM uses a fine tuned, production hardened way to supply caching information that applies to the specific CDN, in conjunction with our reliable push invalidation. This allows us to improve cache efficiency and consistency over traditional TTL based approaches.
Every CDN vendor supports a way to directly influence how to instruct caching and we are excited to see standardization efforts like "Targeted Cache Control" (TCC) being on the roadmap for Akamai (see: https://www.akamai.com/blog/news/targeted-cache-control), in the meantime we are using Akamai's long-term supported Edge-Control header.

Operational Telemetry
Adobe Experience Manager uses Operational Telemetry to gather operations data that is strictly necessary to discover and fix functional and performance issues on Adobe Experience Manager-powered sites. Operational Telemetry data can be used to diagnose performance issues. Operational Telemetry preserves the privacy of visitors through sampling (only a small portion of all page views will be monitored).
Privacy
Operational Telemetry in Adobe Experience Manager is designed to preserve visitor privacy and minimize data collection. As a visitor, this means that Adobe will not attempt to collect personal information about you or information that can be tracked back to you. As a site operator, review the data items collected below to understand if they require consent.AEM Operational Telemetry does not use any client-side state or ID, such as cookies or localStorage, sessionStorage or similar, to collect usage metrics. Data is submitted transparently through a Navigator.sendBeacon call, not through pixels or similar techniques. There is no “fingerprinting” of devices or individuals via their IP address, User Agent string, or any other data for the purpose of capturing sampled data.
It is not permitted to add any personal data into the Operational Telemetry data collection nor may Operational Telemetry data be used for use cases that go beyond strictly necessary.
Operational Telemetry data is sampled
Traditional web analytics solutions try to collect every single visitor. Adobe Experience Manager’s Operational Telemetry only captures information from a small fraction of activities tied to page views, with no concept of identifying a visitor or a user or even a browser session. Under normal circumstances the sampling rate is one out of one hundred page views , although site operators can decide to increase or decrease this number.
As the decision if data will be collected is made on a page view by page view basis, it cannot be used to track interactions across multiple pages. Operational Telemetry has no concept of visits, visitors, or sessions, only checkpoints during a page view. This is by design.
What data is being collected
Operational Telemetry is designed to prevent the collection of personally identifiable information. The full set of information that can be collected by Adobe Experience Manager’s Operational Telemetry is:
The host name of the site being visited, such as www.aem.live
The host name of the server responsible for the data collection such as rum.hlx.live
The user agent (technical name of the browser) that is used to display the page such as Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 14_4_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.0.3 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1. This string is then simplified to desktop, desktop:windows, desktop:mac, desktop:linux, mobile, mobile:android, mobile:ios, mobile:ipados, or bot so that only the device class is stored.
The time of the data collection such as 2021-06-26 06:00:02.596000 UTC (in order to preserve privacy, we round all minutes to the previous hour, so that only seconds and milliseconds are tracked)
The URL of the page being visited, such as https://www.aem.live/docs/operational-telemetry if the URL contains URL parameters, these parameters will not be collected or stored
The Referrer URL (the URL of the page that linked to the current page) such as https://www.aem.live/docs
A randomly generated ID of the page view such as 2Ac6
The weight or inverse of the sampling rate such as 100 (this means only one in one hundred page views will be recorded)
The checkpoint, or name of a particular event in the sequence of loading the page or interacting with it as a visitor such as viewmedia (this particular checkpoint is fired when an image becomes at least 25% visible in the browser)
The source, or identifier of the DOM element that the received the interaction event with for the checkpoint mentioned above such as .images
The target, or link to an external page or resource that received and interaction with for the checkpoint mentioned above such as https://blog.adobe.com/jp/publish/2022/06/29/media_162fb947c7219d0537cce36adf22315d64fb86e94.png
The Core Web Vitals (CWV) performance metrics Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) that describe the visitor’s quality of experience.
The foundational performance metric Time to First Byte (TTFB) that describes the visitors's quality of experience
No other data is being collected.
What data is being stored in the visitor's browser
For sites that use the built-in experimentation feature, the name of the experiment and variants that the visitor has seen are also stored in the browser's session storage.
How Operational Telemetry data is being used
Adobe uses Operational Telemetry data for following purposes:
To identify and fix performance bottlenecks on customer sites
To estimate the number of page views to customer sites
To understand how Adobe Experience Manager interacts with other scripts (such as analytics, targeting, or external libraries) on the same page to increase compatibility
These use cases are strictly necessary to ensure sites running on AEM are working for their visitors.
Data Overview
The data collected and stored is designed to prevent:
Identification of individual visitors or devices
Fingerprinting
Tracking of visits or sessions
Enrichment or combination with personal identifiable information from other sources
Other than Adobe, following third parties are involved in the collection of Operational Telemetry data:
Fastly, Inc
Cloudflare, Inc
Coralogix LTD
Google LLC
Amazon.com, Inc
Operational Telemetry for Developers
We have additional in-depth information for developers that want to use data to optimize their own sites, including instructions on how to add Operational Telemetry instrumentation to your site, even if it's not running on AEM.

Developing Operational Telemetry in AEM
Adobe Experience Manager uses Operational Telemetry to diagnose usage and performance of web sites running on Adobe Experience Manager. As a developer, you can use the Operational Telemetry APIs to observe additional events about how your site is used.
This document describes the key concepts of Real Use Monitoring, details the client-side APIs that you can use to send additional data to the Operational Telemetry collection service and alludes to the fact that the data can be queried.
How to add Operational Telemetry Instrumentation to your Site
If your website is not built using AEM Edge Delivery Services, it is recommended to set up Real Use Monitoring in standalone mode. To set up , simply add the following script to your pages.
<script defer type="text/javascript" src="https://rum.hlx.page/.rum/@adobe/helix-rum-js@^2/dist/rum-standalone.js"></script>
For better performance, it is recommended loading the script after the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) event
Key Concepts
Every data point collected by Operational Telemetry is made up of following key parts:
id – a unique identifier, generated by the Operational Telemetry library that identifies the current page view
checkpoint – a named event in the sequence of loading the page, and interacting with the page
source – identifies the DOM element that caused a particular interaction (optional)
target – identifies an external resource or link that is the subject of an interaction (optional)
Checkpoints
By convention, checkpoint names are lowercase letters, without any special characters. The most common checkpoints used in Adobe Experience Manager projects are:
top – the page loading sequence has begun and first JavaScript code is being executed by the page. This event fires even before blocks are decorated or content is visible
load – corresponds to the Window: load event in JavaScript and is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and images.
cwv – indicates that either the page is ready to collect Core Web Vitals (CWV) readings or that either the LCP, CLS, or FID CWV reading has been recorded. As these readings are asynchronous, multiple of these checkpoints can be passed during one page view
lazy – the page is ready for lazy loading of non-essential resources as part of the Lazy stage of the ELD cycle.
lcp – the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) has been made by the browser, this is usually the most prominent image on the page
viewblock – a block has scrolled into view and there is a chance that the content of that block is seen. The class name of the block will be shared in the source property.
viewmedia – an image or video has scrolled into view and there is a chance that the content of that block is seen. The URL of the image or video is shared in the target property.
click – a click event has been triggered, not just on links or buttons. If the element clicked is a link, then the link target is recorded in the target property. The source property contains information about which element of the DOM was clicked.
experiment – an experiment (challenger or control) has been presented, which can be an A/B test or targeted content.
error – a JavaScript error has occurred on the page and has not been handled by the application code. This usually indicates a bug.
404 – a 404, page not found page has been served. This checkpoint can indicate missing content or broken links
unsupported – the page has been opened by a browser that does not support the more advanced Operational Telemetry collection features. This checkpoint is fired by less than a tenth of a percent of all page views. There is also the related noscript checkpoint for browsers that do not have JavaScript enabled, which is even less common.
search – a site search on the page is performed, typically using a search input field
formsubmit – a form is submitted on the page. The form action is recorded in the target property, while the source property keeps information of which form of the page was submitted.
leave – corresponds to the Window: pagehide event or to Document: visibilitychange event (whichever happens first) if the new document.visibilityState is hidden. This checkpoint is triggered when the page is not visible anymore, e.g. when the browser is closed, or when switched to a different tab in the browser.

Operational Telemetry
Every AEM Site, including Adobe Experience Manager Sites as a Cloud Service without Edge Delivery Services, collects metrics and data by default. This data is sampled, and used by Adobe to diagnose issues around performance, traffic acquisition, and conversion for customer sites.
With Operational Telemetry, Adobe offers a simple user interface to explore the collected data for a given domain. It is a simple data visualization tool for authors, site owners, developers, and operations teams to understand how their site is doing and what can be improved.
Insights in the Operational Telemetry are meant to be shared, therefore for each view of the Operational Telemetry explorer, you can copy, paste, and share the URL from the browser to invite team members to look over the data.
All Operational Telemetry data is sampled, which means each data point represents hundreds, or even thousands of page views. This sampling means that data analysis is fast, but it also means that, like in every measurement system, there is a margin of error. Hover the mouse over a number displayed to see the margin of error. Sampling also means that the uncertainty in the data rises when you filter out more of the data.
User Interface Overview
Operational Telemetry is available at https://www.aem.live/tools/oversight/explorer.html and you need a domain key to access the data for most domains. Data for the website emigrationbrewing.com, a small but great Salt Lake City-based restaurant is open for everyone, so you can explore it under https://www.aem.live/tools/oversight/explorer.html?domain=emigrationbrewing.com&view=month&domainkey=open
The user interface is broken down in three parts:
Key metrics on the top left. These key metrics are split into business metrics (page views, visits, engagement) and performance metrics (Largest Contentful Paint, Cumulative Layout Shift, Interaction to Next Paint) and will update whenever you change the filters.
A chart on the bottom left that provides an at-a glance visualization of your data. The default visualization is to show page views and performance metrics over time.
A set of facets that allow you to drill down into the data on the right. Each facet comes with checkboxes that allow you to filter the full data set to only include matching page views and three kinds of metrics around performance, traffic acquisition, and engagement.
Date Ranges
Operational Telemetry explorer allows you to look at the data over time, to identify recent, short-term and long-term trends. Under each of the key metrics at the top of the page you can find a small green or red line telling you at a glance if there is a positive or negative trend.
Weekly View
Viewing by Week is done by changing the dropdown to the right of the URL from Month to Week. Data in the chart is broken down by hour, which gives more precision than the default Month view which is broken down by day. Please be aware of the tradeoff of zooming in more closely - the benefits of having a smaller dataset for each hour can reveal an extrapolation-related drawback if there is not much data collected in a given hour.
Yearly View
It is also possible to zoom out and see data for a full year, broken down by week.
Additional Views
The default view explored so far is the timeline view. For some data, this is not the best visualization and alternative drill down views are offered. To enter a drill down view, locate a facet on the right side of the screen, click the little arrow pointing downwards, and you'll see data for that facet alone visualized.
When you've seen enough, click the arrow pointing upward to navigate back.
Device Share
In the Device Type and Operating System facet, there is a small down arrow box. Clicking this drill down updates the chart on the screen to become a pie chart which shows how different devices use the site. The inner pie represents the distribution of Operational Telemetry data collection among the major device type categories - desktop, mobile, and bot. The outer pie breaks it down further by the operating system category. Click the up arrow box in the facet header to return to the original chart view.
Top URLs
You can navigate to the top URLs bar chart from the URL facet in the sidebar. For each URL, you can see the distribution of performance metrics. Pages with good performance appear green, pages with poor performance red. For some pages there is not enough data, these are shown in gray.

The final visualization is the flow diagram (also called a Sankey diagram, after the inventor of this style of chart). It allows you to see how visitors enter a page (on the left), consume content and engage with it (in the middle) and leave the page, or stop interacting with it (on the right)
Focus Modes
Depending on whether you are an author, a marketer, a developer, or a designer, different aspects of the data matter to you. The focus mode selector at the top right of the facet sidebar allows you to select a view that fits your needs.
Performance Focus
The default focus is the performance focus and it shows Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and Interaction to Next Paint (INP).
Green indicators mean that this performance metric is in a good state, yellow means it needs improvement, and red means performance is poor.
Do not read "needs improvement" as "it is not great, but acceptable", our data shows that anything that is not marked green leads to significant decreases of user experience, and therefore higher bounce rate and lower engagement.
For each of the focus views, a thick border around the facet metric means that there is a significant difference in that metric compared to the baseline (all page views). These are the areas that deserve further investigation.
Traffic Acquisition Focus
It does not matter how fast a site is if it can't attract and keep visitors. This is what the traffic acquisition focus is all about.
The core metrics for traffic acquisition are:
Bounce Rate (BOUNCE): this is the share of traffic that enters your site, and leaves immediately without clicking anywhere on the page. Accepting a consent banner isn't counted as a click for this metric. Generally this metric should be as low as possible, but any value below 50% is great.
Time on page (TIME): how long does a page view take on average? Longer times indicate that visitors are deeply engaged with your content, short times mean that the page isn't able to hold their attention
Organic Percentage (ORGANIC): great pages are able to attract traffic organically, i.e. without having to buy ads to acquire traffic. The organic percentage is the share of traffic that enters your page without following an ad. Internal navigation isn't considered when calculating organic share.
Conversion or Engagement
This focus mode can show one of two metrics:
Engagement Rate (ENGAGEMENT) is the percentage of page views where visitors either consumed significant amounts of content or clicked. Engagement rates can be very high, often reaching up to 90%.
Conversion Rate (CONVERSION) requires a custom conversion definition, which allows you to declare what kind of engagement is most valuable. This rate is often in the single digits, and a 5% rate can be good for many sites.
Exploring the Data
The fastest way to drill down into your data is to type a term into the search field above the facet sidebar. Any data point that has the search term either in the URL or in the checkpoints will be considered, the match will be highlighted and you can quickly see what has been found.
The facets offer a more structured approach to drilling down on the data. Each data point is classified across multiple dimensions, and you can include or exclude any category of page views depending on their facet values.
Device Type and Operating System
Operational Telemetry does not track the user agents to preserve visitor privacy, but from the information available it can discern the broad device classes Mobile, Desktop, and Bot. Bot includes crawlers that access your site and execute JavaScript. The bot traffic you will see on the Operational Telemetry explorer is smaller than what you would see in your CDN statistics, as most bots do not execute JavaScript and do not try to mimic a visitor. An important exception are search engines, which do execute JavaScript and are visible in Operational Telemetry explorer.
For each broad device class, the operating system of the browser is broken out, too. This allows you to distinguish between macOS and Windows (and Linux, too – although some bots disguise themselves as Linux visitors) and between iOS and Android. You will notice that the iOS traffic does not report Core Web Vitals, which is a limitation of the browsers available on iOS.
If you click a checkbox for a device class, you will see all traffic in that device class, regardless of operating system. If you check a checkbox for an operating system, you will only see the traffic of that operating system. Selecting multiple checkboxes will show all traffic that satisfies any of the checked boxes.
Use the Device Type and Operating System Facet to determine whether the operating system has influence on experience quality and visitor behavior.
If you want to include a facet, click the checkbox and only data points that fulfill the criteria are included. To exclude a facet, hold the shift key while clicking the checkbox and that category will be excluded. In the screenshot above, all Bot traffic has been excluded from the overall count.
URL
The URL facet shows the different pages that make up your site. In some cases, when URLs contain long numbers, or other types of IDs, all paths following the same pattern will be grouped together to make it easier to identify patterns.
Checkpoints
Checkpoints represent the type of activity collected. Each different checkpoint includes additional data, which can be seen by checking the box next to a checkpoint. For example, checking the Visit Entry (enter) checkpoint will load an additional facet named External Referrer. Checking the Clicked (click) checkpoint will load two additional facets - Click Source which shows CSS selectors to help identify where on the page a user clicked, and Click Target which shows where the clicks take the user. Try out the various checkpoints and see what insights are available.
Checkpoint-Specific Facets
The following facets only appear when you've selected the corresponding checkpoint.
Facet: Viewmedia
You can see the CSS selector of the image (Media Source) and a preview of the image or video that has been seen (Media Target).
Facet: Viewblock
This facet allows you to identify the blocks that visitors have seen. The CSS selector includes the block name, and can include additional information such as dialog for elements that are fixed in the viewport and can't be scrolled away.
Facet: Navigate
This facet enables us to discover internal navigation paths. For external referrers, the enter checkpoint can be used.
Facet: Enter
For external referrers, often only the domain name, or in case of Android apps, the name of the Android application is visible. The value direct subsumes visitors entering the URL directly into their address bar, following browser bookmarks, or opening the page from iOS applications.
Facet: LCP
Drilling down into the LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) checkpoint allows a developer to identify elements of the page that are slowing down page loading. It is often ideal to combine this with a URL filter, as LCP elements vary from page to page and between desktop and mobile browsers.
Facet: Click
The click checkpoint tracks where on the page visitors clicked (CSS Selector) and what links have been clicked. This is useful for identifying internal and external navigation targets.
Conversion Definition
The most in-depth analysis that you can perform with Operational Telemetry explorer is to understand conversion rates. As Operational telemetry does not require any special instrumentation of the page to identify conversions, defining what a conversion is can be done ad-hoc.
This is a three-step process:
Filter the traffic (using facets) down to traffic that is a valid conversion
Redefine the conversion definition using that filter
Analyze the data using the new conversion definition
Whenever facet values have been selected in the sidebar and no conversion has been defined yet, the Engagement key metric area will feature a "redefine" button. Use the filters to select traffic that matches your defined criteria. In this example, we select visitors who have scrolled down far enough to see the footer of the page, so the criteria is a combination of the viewblock checkpoint and the Block CSS Selector (target).
A
After clicking redefine, the draft conversion definition will be highlighted and a confirm button will appear. Click the confirm button to dial in the new conversion definition.
Your new conversion definition has been applied and all elements that referred to Engagement so far will now use the conversion definition. Please note that conversion rate is calculated against the baseline of visits, not against page views like the engagement rate.

Fastly Setup for hlx.live
NOTE: The instructions linked on this page apply to the previous version of Edge Delivery Services and are provided for customers who have not upgraded to aem.live yet. The current version of this document is provided here.
The following screenshots illustrate how to configure Fastly to deliver content. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
Setup push invalidation for Fastly
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
Configuration properties:
To create a Fastly API Token,
go to Personal API Tokens,
click on "Create Token",
enter a name (e.g. "Production Site Purge Token"),
select "A specific service" and your production service from the drop-down list,
check the "Purge select content (purge_select) — Purge by URL or surrogate key" check box,
select "Never expire",
click on "Create Token",
copy the generated token value shown in the pop-up window.
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
Create a Fastly service
Go to the Fastly Management UI and select Create Service:
Add Domain
Add your production domain (e.g. www.mydomain.com):
Configure Origin
Add your origin (e.g. main--mysite--hlxsites.hlx.live):
Click on the pencil to edit the new origin:
Scroll down and change Shielding to Ashburn Metro (IAD) (non-mandatory but recommended setting) and Override host to the hostname of your origin (same as Address above, e.g. main--mysite--hlxsites.hlx.live) (mandatory setting):
Enable Gzip
Create VCL Snippets
Create a VCL snippet for the recv subroutine with the following VCL code:
Create VCL snippets for the miss and pass subroutines with the following VCL code:
NB: The X-Push-Invalidation: enabled request header enables the push invalidation incl. long cache TTLs.
miss snippet:
pass snippet:
Create a deliver snippet with the following VCL code:
Finally create a deliver snippet with the following VCL code:
After completing all steps and activating the service version you should be all set:
Note
Your Fastly setup should not use Fastly’s Next Generation Web Application Firewall for requests that are going against hlx.live or any other Edge Delivery Services origin. Enabling WAF with Edge Delivery Services can lead to erroneous content being delivered.
Edge Delivery Services needs no Web Application Firewall, as it is running on hardened, shared, and ultra-scalable infrastructure. Requests that a WAF would typically intercept are terminated in our CDNs.

David’s Model, Second take.
By: David Nuescheler
Historical Context
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I got to a point where I realized that people had a lot of different options on how they could model content in a content repository specification that I was involved in.
So in 2007 I started writing up my controversial opinions around content modeling in JCR and to make sure that people considered it “just my opinion” and nothing that would claim universal applicability I called it “David’s Model”.
It seems that this has helped people in the context of modeling content on an infrastructure level.
Today, I find myself very often in situations that feel the same when arguing “How to model or structure content in Adobe Experience Manager”.
The parameters and stakeholders feel very different today, as I am not primarily worried about the underlying infrastructure anymore but about the user experience of a person authoring content and reaching a great authoring experience across different content sources and to a lesser extent the ease of developing against those structures and being able have portable (block) code across projects and content sources.
Introduction
This document should serve as a collection of “Content Modeling” or “Content Structure” best practices as they relate to Adobe Experience Manager and more importantly to an intuitive authoring experience across different authoring platforms. A good way of testing a content model, is to imagine an author working in different environments (eg. Word, Google Docs, AEM, Custom Authoring etc.) and making sure that the content model can easily be constructed in an intuitive manner across all possible content sources.
These “rules” are a reflection of lessons learned from first-hand authoring and authoring support and are rooted in the experiences working on real-world limitations of commonly used authoring environments like Microsoft Word Online or Google Docs, but also in the average knowledge of said tooling by the average author.
Making the authoring experience intuitive, simple and fast is paramount for the long-term success of any project as lays the foundation of authors enjoying making updates to websites or other digital experiences.
These rules are evolving, and I would like to invite discussion and commentary on all of them.
Rule #1: Blocks are not great for authoring
Generally blocks are not great as they are surfaced as tables on the authoring side. They provide a necessary framework for an author to indicate some special functionality or design for a certain component. For authors it is often easier to work in “Default Content” wherever possible.For developers blocks are a great way to componentize their work, so there is tension where the developer feels that having something in a block makes their lives easier, sacrificing authoring ease-of-use.
The number of blocks and block variants, as well as (section-) metadata that influence layout should be limited by a design system. Often variants or blocks can be inferred, meaning that for example a carousel containing a video or a quote with an image should not be its own (explicit) block or variant but can be inferred automatically from the content.
A lot of content that is referenced via URL (e.g. a video, modal, fragment or an embed) can often be auto blocked, and the author may just be able to paste the URL to get the desired result.
It is definitely an anti-pattern to have things that are represented natively as default content and put them into a block, so something like a Text, Heading or Image block yields a bad authoring perspective.
Rule #2: No nested blocks for authors
To a developer it might very often be tempting to nest complex structures, which in word document would lead to a table inside a table. As Rule #1 states that blocks are not desirable, nested blocks are definitely a lot worse.
Consider fragments (referencing other documents) or links (with auto blocking) to reduce the authoring complexity.
Rule #3: Limit Row and Column spans
Generally we use a Column Span (merged cells) to denote the header with a block name in it. This is relatively straightforward and works well in word and google docs.There are definitely situations where more complex table structure make sense (eg. a portion of the block content being in two columns and another portion of the block content being in three columns) but it is important to understand that creating and managing these structures can be extremely difficult, especially in word online that has very enigmatic support for complex tables.
If you find yourself in a place where you have a non-trivial rows and columns setup with spans / merged cells, it is probably a good idea to consider a different structure.
Rule #4: Fully qualified URLs only
When referencing content sometimes developers think in references that are relative to host, the content repository or to their sharepoint / google drive. Authors (and most humans) often think of a URL as an opaque token that they copy/paste from their browser without deciphering them into protocol, hostname, pathname, etc.It is always advisable to just let authors work fully qualified URLs and let either AEM or a developer do the work of extracting eg. a pathname where needed. As a bonus the URL can and should link to something that is easily accessible for an author from their document.
Rule #5: Lists?
I often find myself in a situation where a block has a list of references, something like a list of related articles, or a list of cards. In HTML a lot of those semantically should be considered lists (mostly <ul><il> combinations). For simple lists, something like some text (possibly with a link) or just regular links, a list in word or google docs may be ideal.
It turns out that list items that are more complex, are somewhere between “hard” to “practically impossible” for an author to keep that in a list in word or google drive.In that case it is much easier to have the list items be rows of a block table. A good example of that is cards block in the boilerplate project.
For simple lists where it is intuitive to have inferred semantics, eg. a related articles block in a blog post that just contains links to the articles that should be references, it may be easiest to just have a single table cell inside the block containing all the links and dropping the actual list in the word processor. From a code standpoint it is usually easy to just pull all the links from a block and not specifically worry about the details of a structure in that particular block.
Rule #6: Buttons need to inherit from context
In many design guides we find buttons as a common element across many blocks and default content. In many cases they are outlined in all their variations (eg. primary vs. secondary, sizes, colors, etc.) at the beginning of a design specification together with the specified colors and fonts.
In projects we found that it is intuitive for authors to treat links that are on a line by themselves as for a button. In many cases it is important to inherit from the block and section context that a particular button is in to make the authoring experience easy.
As an example, if a button (read, “link by itself on a line”) is a part of a hero block, it might assume a certain bigger size, or if a button is in a section that has an inverted background color it might need to automatically switch to a different foreground / background color combination.
There are cases where within a given section / block context the author needs to be offered a set of explicit choices (eg. primary vs. secondary button) and in those cases we use combinations of bold and italic, usually bold for an explicit primary button and italic for an explicit secondary button.
It is conceivable that within a given block / section context there are more than four options for an author to choose from, in which case other formatting options could be used like underline, strikethrough etc. however, this is extremely rare and usually an indication that a decision that should be made within the design system is delegated to the author, leading to a less intuitive authoring experience.
Rule #7: Filenames matter to authors
There are a few content management systems that append trailing slashes to all their URLs and when migrating from websites that are powered by those systems an intuitive approach could be to map every single URL to an index (.docx or gdoc) inside a folder. The downside of this approach is that the filenames are not really useful anymore for authors when they are searching for files in gdrive and sharepoint.
A better approach is to remove the trailing slashes from the URLs and redirect with a 301 (usually from the redirects spreadsheet) from the existing URLs with a trailing slash to the URLs without a trailing slash.
(related: the same approach should also be used for other undesirable URLs for example URLs that end in .html)
There are situations where this change results in too much a temporary SEO impact, in which case rewriting the URLs on the CDN may be the appropriate option, however this should only be done if there is a quantifiable business impact. long term it is more desirable to have a clean URL that maps directly to the corresponding file in sharepoint or gdrive.
Rule #8: Access Controls and Content Grouping
It often makes sense to group content similar to how authoring teams are organized. A good way of thinking about this is that if you have a team that looks after the blog section on your website, technical documentation, support content, a particular country / language or a product it makes sense to keep that content together, and make sure that corresponding team has access to the content.
In organizations this often happens naturally, and it is intuitive for organizations to break up their content teams similar to the structure of their URL space. In some cases the URL structure doesn’t align with authoring teams (and the corresponding access control groups). In such a case combining multiple AEM projects on the CDN tier tying together content from different sources may be the right approach if the complexity and size of a site (single domain) gets overwhelming.While your content source (Sharepoint and Google Drive) possibly supports complex access control models, it is desirable to keep Access Control as simple as possible from a management standpoint.
Both Sharepoint and Google Drive have a concept for grouping content that helps to manage access control in a simple manner, in Sharepoint they are called “Sites” or “Libraries” and in Google Drive they are called “Shared Drives”. Both of those have predefined access control roles that are advantageous to use for simple group membership based access. Unless there are specific access control requirements it is recommended to keep access control to these OOTB groups.
Sites/Libraries and Share Drives are built to work well with a certain team and content size and complexity.
Particularly Sharepoint has best practices on access control complexity within a library, and creating access control complexity beyond that may yield undesirable results. In case you get to a place where it becomes unnatural to manage either the size of the content or the size and complexity in a single Site/Library or Shared Drive, it is likely that it makes sense to break things up into multiple different Site/Libraries or Shared Drives and blend the content together from different projects on the CDN.
Rule #9: Number of Blocks and Variants
Over the lifecycle of a website it is common that new blocks and variants are added. Especially for developers that are not very familiar with the existing block library of the project it is usually the easiest path to just add net new blocks or variants to make sure that there is no regression with existing content.
While it is probably not easy to avoid the sprawl of blocks and variants on projects that have a lot of functionality or justified requirements for a lot of visually diverse content within a single project, it is important to make sure that the core set of blocks and variant combinations that authors need to use commonly is limited. There are situations where special blocks are used infrequently on sites and often those are placed by developers initially, those blocks probably don’t need to be exposed to authors at the same level in documentation or a block library as the commonly used blocks.More generally, large block libraries and a lot of variant / section metadata combinations are less desirable. Maintaining a “minimum use” criteria for blocks and variants based on a content report is a good practice to deprecate and remove superfluous code from the block library that’s exposed to authors.
Rule #10: Limit number of Columns
A large number of columns is not a good ideal for authoring as there are practical horizontal screen / document size limitations. More importantly this is usually a symptom that content is split into small values that do not reflect a proper use of default content and the implied HTML semantics.There are some exceptions to this rule in cases where data is represented in a table, as opposed to content that should be a part of document semantics, and in those cases it is often useful to go the name-value pair route via a spreadsheet instead.
Rule #11: Use the block collection content models
The AEM Block Collection is a great source for well designed content models. If your block is producing a similar feature set as the one of the blocks in the Block Collection, the content model should be similar.
Rule #12: Fragments may be harmful
Fragments are very useful when the same content is used across a lot of different pages. Obvious good examples are header (navigation) and footer information that is identical throughout a site. These are great examples especially since authors of individual pages do not have to worry about that content showing up on their page, and there is no authoring impact.Using Fragments may also be useful in situations where there is an explicit selection of a content that is used across many pages of a site, such as a sign up form, a legal disclaimer, etc. and the content appears on a page but is not really a part of the canonical content of the page.
It is important to note that using a fragment comes at a cost of complexity and indirection for authors. Instead of seeing the actual content that is on a page, an author only sees a reference to a fragment, which makes it much less intuitive for authors to make changes and gauge the impact of their changes across pages. This is even amplified in cases of nested fragments.
Along those lines, from an SEO standpoint it is only advisable to use fragments at times where having duplicate content is acceptable (meaning that the content inside a fragment doesn't carry significant SEO weight for that page), hence content that is relevant from an SEO standpoint should always be placed on the page directly.
Rule #13: Don't overload image alt-text semantics
It may be convenient at times to put extra information hidden away into image alt-texts, but this is only recommended in exceptional cases.Alt-texts often cannot be easily discovered by authors, there is very little indication about their existence in common document authoring environments (eg. word or google docs).Depending on the type of copy/paste operation the alt-text may be lost without the author noticing, and if the alt-text contains special semantics, authors will have to be familiar with specific semantics within the value of an alt-text of individual images on a per block basis.
Rule #14: Use Name/Value pairs only for configuration
There are situations where name/value pairs can be useful to indicate a configuration for a block similar to a section or page (via metadata). This should only be used in exceptional cases and largely for content that is not displayed as such, and is outside of the well established semantic model of document semantics. In section metadata processing the name value pairs get converted into data- attributes, which illustrates the model on how name/value pairs should be thought of in blocks that require configuration. Related to rule #1, it is definitely not recommended to map default content concepts and have name/value pairs for things like Heading, Image or Text.

How to use Sharepoint (delegated)
NOTE: for projects using Adobe’s Sharepoint (https://adobe.sharepoint.com) please continue here.
If you use SharePoint as your content source, AEM uses a registered Microsoft Azure application to do so. This application has delegated permissions defined that allow the service to access SharePoint on behalf of a user. This user needs to be registered to the project that is using SharePoint.
Alternatively, the services can also authenticate as an application and use application permissions to access the sites. This needs additional setup by a SharePoint site administrator that can grant the permissions for the application.
The preferred setup is to use application permissions, as this narrows down the access the service has to a specific SharePoint site and does not require to share any secrets of a technical user. Also, it reduces the problems around password rotation. Please continue here for instruction on how to do so.
The following describes how to set up delegated permissions for your project.
Setting up SharePoint involves the following steps:
Create a folder within SharePoint that will be the website root.
Create or define the (technical) user that will access the SharePoint content
Share the website root folder with that user.
Configure the fstab.yaml with the respective folder
Register the user with the service
1. Create the website root folder
Navigate to your desired location in SharePoint and create a root folder that will be your website root. It is best to not use a SharePoint list root directly, so that you have a shared space for your authors to put collateral documents, for example a drafts folder, or how-to-author documentations.
An example file structure might look like this, using the website folder as the root:
2. Create or define the user
It is best practice to use a generic (or technical) user to access the content on behalf of the service. This is better than using an employee user account because the exact scope of the files the user can access can be defined. Furthermore, there is no risk losing access to the files, should that employee leave the company.
Every company has different procedures to create technical users, so ask your IT department on how to do this.
3. Share the website root folder
NOTE: for projects using Adobe’s Sharepoint (https://adobe.sharepoint.com) please see here.
Ensure that the service user has edit rights on the website root folder. This can be achieved easily by clicking on the … ellipsis menu and selecting “Manage Access”.
And then add the generic (or technical) user user via the “Direct access” option.
4. Configure the fstab.yaml
The next step is to configure the mountpoint in the fstab.yaml to point to the website root. It usually has the form of
But this might vary depending on how you create the SharePoint site and lists. In order to obtain the url, the simplest way is to copy-past the first part from the browser address, eg:
And then add the rest manually (Note, that copying the sharelink via the UI adds unnecessary information and it is better to use a canonical representation of the url). Once you composed the url, you can test it by entering it again in the browser. You should end up in the folder view of your website root.
After that, update the fstab.yaml accordingly.
For example:
To finalize the configuration, commit the fstab.yaml back to the main branch.
5. Register the user
Overview
In order for the AEM service to access the authored content it needs a couple of information and setup. The AEM service (a cloud function) accesses the MS Graph API on behalf of a configured user. In order to do so, it needs to authenticate first in the context of an Application. This is important because the scopes given to the application define what permission the service has on the MS Graph API. For example, it should be allowed to read and write documents, but not to alter access control.
An application is represented as an “Enterprise Application” in the respective Active Directory of a tenant. The permissions given to that enterprise application ultimately define what the service can access in that tenant’s resources. Certain permissions need to be approved by an Active Directory administrator before a user can use the application. This so-called “admin consent” is a mechanism to verify and control which permissions apps can have. This is to prevent dubious apps from tricking users into trusting an app that is not official. Having the extra admin consent step allows IT security to control which apps the employees can use.
1. Sign-in in the Registration Portal
View Enterprise Applications in Azure Portal
Assuming that so far no AEM Enterprise Applications are present in Azure (Microsoft Entra Id)
Access The Registration Portal
Go to https://admin.hlx.page/register, enter the github url of the project or the org/site values of your site config.
Sign-in as non admin user
Sign in as a user that does not have admin permissions will show an error that it needs approval, i.e. the application needs admin consent.
Problem: Enterprise Application is not registered if a user never logs in.
Sign-in as admin user
One solution is to sign in as a user that does have admin permissions:
(note, at this point the Enterprise Application is still not registered in azure)
AEM Content Integration Registration visible in UI
If the admin logs in (without checking the checkbox and granting consent for everyone), the Enterprise application is present.
Create application using MSGraph or Powershell
Alternatively, you can create the Enterprise application via MSGraph or Powershell.
In order to make it visible in the azure UI you also need to add the WindowsAzureActiveDirectoryIntegratedApp tag. This can be done directly when creating the application.Using graph explorer:
Using powershell:
After that you still need to give admin consent, if you want a non admin user to login.

Review permissions
Note that the AEM Content Integration Registration (e34c45c4-0919-43e1-9436-448ad8e81552) application is only needed during registration to verify that the user has read access to the sharepoint. It has the following delegated permissions:
OpenidAllows users to sign in to the app with their work or school accounts and allows the app to see basic user profile information.
ProfileAllows the app to see your users' basic profile (e.g., name, picture, user name, email address)
Files.ReadWrite.AllAllows the app to read, create, update and delete all files the signed-in user can access.
User logged in Registration portal
After completing this initial step, the user is logged in the registration portal
Verify write access to the content source via challenge file
Download the challenge file
Before you can register (or change) the registration. You have to prove that you have write access to the respective sharepoint location. For that you need to upload a text file containing the mentioned content. This can easily be done by downloading the file and drop it into the sharepoint folder.
After that, click on Validate to continue the registration.
Connect the technical User
With the permission properly granted, you should be able to login properly to the Registration Setup UI:
Click on “Connect User” and you should see a new login window, where you want to login with your technical user. This the the AEM Content Integration is requesting for more permissions to access sharepoint:
Similar to above, and administrator needs to consent to the permissions:
After the login process, the UI should show the connected user information:
Once the user is registered, you should be able to preview a page.
Important
Changing the user's password will invalidate the grant that is established when connecting the user. This will eventually cause an error in the sidekick. In order to prevent this, you need to reconnect the user, by clicking the disconnect button then connect it again.

How to use Adobe Sharepoint
NOTE: This only applies for projects on Adobe’s Sharepoint (https://adobe.sharepoint.com) . For projects using a non Adobe Sharepoint, please continue here.
Setting up sharepoint involves the following steps:
Create a folder within sharepoint that will be the website root.
Share the website root folder with that user.
Configure the fstab.yaml with the respective folder
1. Create the website root folder
Navigate to your desired location in sharepoint and create a root folder that will be your website root. It is best to not use a sharepoint list root directly, so that you have a shared space for your authors to put collateral documents, for example a drafts folder, or how-to-author documentations.
An example file structure might look like this, using the website folder as the root:
3. Share the website root folder
Ensure that the helix@adobe.com user has edit rights on the website root folder. This can be achieved easily by clicking on the … ellipsis menu and selecting “Manage Access”.
And then add the user via the “Direct access” option.
4. Configure the fstab.yaml
The next step is to configure the mountpoint in the fstab.yaml to point to the website root. It usually has the form of
But this might vary depending on how you create the sharepoint site and lists. In order to obtain the url, the simplest way is to copy-past the first part from the browser address, eg:
And then add the rest manually (Note, that copying the sharelink via the UI adds unnecessary information and it is better to use a canonical representation of the url). Once you composed the url, you can test it by entering it again in the browser. You should end up in the folder view of your website root.
After that, update the fstab.yaml accordingly.
For example:
To finalize the configuration, commit the fstab.yaml back to the main branch.

Content Security Policy: strict-dynamic + (cached) nonce
Introduction
Content Security Policy is a browser feature that helps prevent and mitigate certain types of threats and attacks.
There are multiple directives to restrict and control which resources can be loaded on your webpage by the browser, which other domains are allowed to iframe your content, etc.
This guide is very specific for mitigating Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks with a specific Content Security Policy configuration in AEM Edge Delivery Services and is not intended to be a general, exhaustive guide of all the Content Security Policy options and possibilities supported by the browser.
Important Note: Content Security Policies are meant as a last line of defense when other measures fail. It is not intended to replace the use of safe DOM APIs and proper sanitisation of user input by developers in the code. It will not cover every single attack path and it is not meant to. It is always recommended that developers code in a safe manner.
The specific content security policy configuration recommended by this guide is:
script-src 'nonce-aem' 'strict-dynamic'; base-uri 'self'; object-src 'none';
As a short summary: This content security policy will allow the execution of only those scripts which have the correct nonce value at top level (nonce component) and any script loaded by these and their descendants client-side, creating a trust chain, as long as the additional scripts are loaded via non-”parser-inserted” elements (strict-dynamic component). More information
We have chosen this specific content security policy after reviewing the following:
The findings of the following Google Research paper in regards to host based CSPs
Ease of deployment and maintenance on customer sites (through the use of strict-dynamic)
The number of threats it mitigates as opposed to other alternatives
How well it fits in the AEM Edge Delivery Services architecture
The recommendation coming from the Google Lighthouse Report
Customers can choose to add other directives to complement this one to meet their security needs.
Configuration
This feature is currently available only for sites using version 5 of the AEM Edge Delivery Services architecture.
There are two components to the configuration:
Trusted Scripts
Policy Enforcement.
Instructions below show how to mark trusted scripts in your repository and then how to configure the policy to be enforced.
After the enforcement is put in place, AEM will replace the aem part of the nonce in both the policy and the script attributes with a cryptographic random string, for every request that hits the rendering engine, generating new HTML markup from content. Once the HTML markup + headers is generated, it is cached on the CDN and is considered immutable.
Requests that hit the CDN cache will see the same nonce value until cache expiration.
The result should look as follows. If you don’t see the nonce generating a random value, it means the configuration was not correctly done.
1. Trusted Scripts
First, no matter how you choose to enforce it, you must add the nonce attribute marker (nonce="aem") to the scripts you trust in HTML. This can be in:
1.1. head.html
1.2. Other static HTML files from your repository (for example 404.html)
2. Policy Enforcement
For enforcing the policy you can configure it via either
Header (recommended)
<meta> tag
It is recommended that the Content Security Policy is delivered to the browser using a header. That way, the browser will apply it before scripts get a chance to execute. When using the meta tag the browser will only apply the policy after it is encountered during parsing, providing no protection for anything that is above it in the HTML.
2.1 Header Configuration
You can choose to configure either the content-security-policy or the content-security-policy-report-only headers with the following value:
script-src 'nonce-aem' 'strict-dynamic'; base-uri 'self'; object-src 'none';
Note: The content-security-policy-report-only header doesn’t offer any protection, it only allows you to test if there are any scripts which would be blocked when the policy is fully enforced through error messages.
This can be done using one of the following methods:
2.1.1 The configuration service
2.1.2 Headers sheet
2.1.3 A specific attribute for the meta tag move-to-http-header="true" (only for content-security-policy and only when using a nonce based CSP).
This method can be useful for trying out the configuration in a branch, but has the disadvantage that it needs to be added to head.html and every other static HTML file from your repository.
2.2 Meta Tag Configuration
You can configure the content security policy also as a meta tag. This is a browser out of the box feature, but it is considered less secure than using a header.
3. A note on BYO CDN - Cloudflare
If you are using Cloudflare as BYO CDN in front of AEM, please ensure that you are using the latest version of the Cloudflare Worker code, which removes the content-security-policy header for 304 response codes.
This ensures that the CDN does not return a content-security-policy header in a 304 response with a nonce value that conflicts with what your users already have in their browser cache.
Technical Deepdive - FAQ
1. Does caching the nonce render the content security policy ineffective?
Based on our current understanding and tests, no, that is not the case, given a set of assumptions, which hold true for typical sites implemented with AEM Edge Delivery Services.
Customers with implementations which break these assumptions should evaluate the effectiveness of the content security policy in the context of the new set of conditions specific for their website.
Assumptions:
Websites do not make modifications server-side to the HTML produced by AEM Edge Delivery Services (for example in the customer’s CDN).
unsafe-eval, unsafe-hashes are not added to the content security policy.
Breaking this down into classes of Cross Site Scripting Attacks:
1. Stored XSS + Reflected XSS
These types of Cross Site Scripting attacks occur through injection server side.
Every new request that hits the AEM Edge Delivery Services’ HTML rendering pipeline will always receive a new nonce value.This effectively mitigates these types of attacks, because attackers trying to inject a <script> tag server side into the HTML cannot guess the new value of the nonce.
2. DOM Based XSS
This type of Cross Site Scripting attack occurs client side, when the client side JavaScript injects user input (from query parameters, url fragments, author supplied information in HTML) without proper context specific encoding/sanitization into a unsafe DOM APIs which interpret the input as HTML or JavaScript, instead of text.
The list below shows which use of DOM APIs* are considered mitigated and which aren't.
*Tested with Chrome, Mozilla, Safari
2.1 Mitigated even if the nonce is cached
✅ HTML inlined attribute event handlers (onclick, onblur, onload, onerror etc.). e.g: <img src='x' onerror='alert("xss")'>
When strict-dynamic is present, browsers will ignore unsafe-inline directive and will not execute inlined even handlers.
✅ javascript: navigations
javascript: protocol in the href/src attributes (e.g. <a href="javascript:alert(1)" >click me!</a>)
location.href / location.assign() / location.replace (e.g. location.href = 'javascript:alert("xss")' )
When strict-dynamic is present, browsers will ignore unsafe-inline directive and will not execute this type of JavaScript.
✅ Eval based XSS - (obviously, as long as unsafe-eval is not present in the policy)
eval / setTimeout / setInterval / Function
✅ .innerHTML, .outerHTML, .insertAdjacentHTML, .setHTMLUnsafe
Modern browsers should not execute <script> tags injected through these DOM APIs, according to the MDN documentation.
This leaves just
HTML inlined event handlers: which as specified above are mitigated
javascript: navigations: which as specified above are mitigated
2.2 not protected, because the nonce is cached
The following DOM APIs remain vulnerable, because looking up the value of the cached nonce can lead to a successful XSS.
❌ document.write / document.writeln
The MDN documentation strongly discourages the use of these APIs.
2.3 not protected, regardless if the nonce is cached
❌ document.createRange().createContextualFragment
whether the nonce is cached/known is irrelevant, scripts injected using this API are always executed when strict-dynamic.
Currently reported to:
https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/issues/708
https://issues.chromium.org/issues/376479689
❌ Unsanitized user input in the following scenarios is not mitigated as the use is permitted by strict-dynamic
src attribute of a <script> tag created by document.createElement('script')
body of a <script> tag created by document.createElement('script')
usage of import API
The general recommendation in these cases is simply that no user input should reach these places (either url path, query parameters, fragment or even from the HTML), as they are extremely difficult to mitigate even with the strictest CSPs.
2.4. not protected by CSPs in general
❌ Script-less attacks: HTML injection, DOM clobbering, etc.
It is important to note that CSPs don’t block every type of web attack and that’s why they are meant as an additional defense, rather than your main defense.
2. Why isn’t the cache simply disabled when the nonce is present?
Like with any engineering solution, the content security policy and protection it provides needs to be put in the context of where it is used and what are the trade-offs.
In AEM Edge Delivery Services the highly efficient use of the CDN cache is a key component of how Adobe delivers high performance, reliability and scalability.
With the current data outlined above, our understanding is that the theoretical disabling of the cache would benefit only a highly discouraged edge case (the usage of document.write / document.writeln), as the other cases don’t seem to depend on whether the nonce is cached or not.
3. Why not use hash based content security policies, which work with caching?
There are a couple of reasons that make the use of hashes less efficient for this architecture:
3.1. We observed that when hashes are used, the import browser API doesn’t work. This is a key component in the AEM Boilerplate and how the client side rendering is structured.
3.2. The second problem is that the policy (which sits in either the HTML header or body) would have a separate caching lifecycle from the scripts referenced in the HTML. This can cause the rendering of the website to break if for any reason the hash from the policy is outdated, compared to the script delivered. This felt like a too high risk for the uptime of the site, especially when the nonce alternative does not suffer from this problem. Since the nonce header and HTML body are always stored together in the cache, this problem should not appear.
4. Why use this content security policy instead of a host based one?
The following research paper from Google has found the following problems, which we could confirm in practice for AEM Edge Delivery Services customers that did have host based content security policies:
4.1. Presence of unsafe-inline for inline scripts, this makes trivial DOM based XSS possible, since any unsanitised user input that ends up in a sink like innerHTML can be exploited.
4.2. Presence of domains where anybody can without restrictions place their own scripts. This presents a very low barrier for an attacker to instead of serving a specific script from a denylisted domain, to just upload it to one that’s allowlisted. Making the advantages over strict-dynamic in practice quite limited.
The host based content security policies are also quite hard to maintain, so we were looking for an alternative which works easily for a majority of customers, without the need for constant maintenance.
If you have script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; you are probably safer, but it means you cannot load any tag manager and any script from outside domains, which we haven't seen this yet in practice.
5. Can’t an attacker simply add another script with nonce="aem" in the HTML, before it is replaced with the actual nonce value?
No. The nonce="aem" attribute is not the main way we determine which scripts to add the new unique nonce value to.
We only apply the unique nonce value to scripts coming from head.html and static HTML files from your repository. These resources are considered trusted and controlled only by your developers. It is considered that if attackers can change these, they already can modify any code in your repository, thus trying to prevent XSS is no longer a concern. Scripts that could theoretically end up injected through any currently unknown method in the HTML will not receive the correct nonce value, even if they have the nonce="aem" attribute.
The nonce="aem" is rather a fallback mechanism, in case Adobe ever needs to deactivate this feature, your site continues to be served, without downtime, because the aem nonce value is present in both script attributes and policy enforcement, even if the protection is degraded.
6. I found a bypass/vulnerability which is not covered here. Can I report it?
Absolutely! Trust, but verify!
We appreciate feedback regarding any inaccuracies of this guide or content security policy approach and thank you for the time to report it to us!
Security measures work best when they are peer-reviewed and limitations well understood!
Please disclose responsibly vulnerabilities, bypasses or findings using the following two possibilities:

A high-five for aem.live
If you've been using Adobe Experience Manager for a short while, you may have wondered what the hlx.live and hlx.page in the preview and live URLs of your site mean. If you have been using AEM for a longer while, you may have wondered when *.hlx.live would follow the steps of aem up, www.aem.live, and AEM Sidekick.
Today is the day we make the switch. I'm happy to announce that hlx.live is now aem.live and this transition brings several new changes that will improve your experience:
New Domains: your site is now available under *.aem.live and previews are on *.aem.page
Improved Performance: Previews on *.aem.page are a bit faster than on *.hlx.page, thanks to better caching
More and better stuff: aem.live enables advanced features such as centralized configurations, repoless sites, and more secure authentication
Starting today, all new projects created from the tutorial, will use the new aem.live architecture. Existing projects can upgrade following these steps.
AEM Live has been in development for nearly a year and in production for over six months. With more than 25% of our traffic now handled by aem.live, it’s proven itself ready for your site’s upgrade and your site will be in good company.
Speaking of good company, Joe Doherty, director of web development at The Channel Company shared this anecdote with us: "We've been running on aem.live since we heard about it on the AEM Discord channel a few months ago. When the business asked us to spin up an entirely new regional site with an unheard-of deadline of just four weeks, other teams would have balked at the challenge. With aem.live and repoless sites, we were able to meet that demand and help our business grow."
Edge Delivery Services for Adobe Experience Manager Sites as a Cloud Service started more than five years ago with Project Helix, and the acronym hlx could be found by our early adopters all over the place: in domains, user names, command line tools, and so on. With aem.live as the default, the name Helix is back to being an internal designator of the architecture version and the hlx.live and hlx.page domain names will see an eventual end of service.
Ready to make the switch? Upgrade your existing projects to aem.live today and start enjoying faster performance, advanced features, and a seamless AEM experience. For detailed instructions on how to upgrade, visit our upgrade guide or reach out to our team for assistance.

How to use Sharepoint (delegated)
NOTE: for projects using Adobe’s Sharepoint (https://adobe.sharepoint.com) please continue here.
If you use SharePoint as your content source, AEM uses a registered Microsoft Azure application to do so. This application has delegated permissions defined that allow the service to access SharePoint on behalf of a user. This user needs to be registered to the project that is using SharePoint.
Alternatively, the services can also authenticate as an application and use application permissions to access the sites. This needs additional setup by a SharePoint site administrator that can grant the permissions for the application.
The preferred setup is to use application permissions, as this narrows down the access the service has to a specific SharePoint site and does not require to share any secrets of a technical user. Also, it reduces the problems around password rotation. Please continue here for instruction on how to do so.
The following describes how to set up delegated permissions for your project.
Setting up SharePoint involves the following steps:
Create a folder within SharePoint that will be the website root.
Create or define the (technical) user that will access the SharePoint content
Share the website root folder with that user.
Configure the fstab.yaml with the respective folder
Register the user with the service
1. Create the website root folder
Navigate to your desired location in SharePoint and create a root folder that will be your website root. It is best to not use a SharePoint list root directly, so that you have a shared space for your authors to put collateral documents, for example a drafts folder, or how-to-author documentations.
An example file structure might look like this, using the website folder as the root:
2. Create or define the user
It is best practice to use a generic (or technical) user to access the content on behalf of the service. This is better than using an employee user account because the exact scope of the files the user can access can be defined. Furthermore, there is no risk losing access to the files, should that employee leave the company.
Every company has different procedures to create technical users, so ask your IT department on how to do this.
3. Share the website root folder
NOTE: for projects using Adobe’s Sharepoint (https://adobe.sharepoint.com) please see here.
Ensure that the service user has edit rights on the website root folder. This can be achieved easily by clicking on the … ellipsis menu and selecting “Manage Access”.
And then add the generic (or technical) user user via the “Direct access” option.
4. Configure the fstab.yaml
The next step is to configure the mountpoint in the fstab.yaml to point to the website root. It usually has the form of

For example:
To finalize the configuration, commit the fstab.yaml back to the main branch.
5. Register the user
Overview
In order for the AEM service to access the authored content it needs a couple of information and setup. The AEM service (a cloud function) accesses the MS Graph API on behalf of a configured user. In order to do so, it needs to authenticate first in the context of an Application. This is important because the scopes given to the application define what permission the service has on the MS Graph API. For example, it should be allowed to read and write documents, but not to alter access control.
An application is represented as an “Enterprise Application” in the respective Active Directory of a tenant. The permissions given to that enterprise application ultimately define what the service can access in that tenant’s resources. Certain permissions need to be approved by an Active Directory administrator before a user can use the application. This so-called “admin consent” is a mechanism to verify and control which permissions apps can have. This is to prevent dubious apps from tricking users into trusting an app that is not official. Having the extra admin consent step allows IT security to control which apps the employees can use.
1. Sign-in in the Registration Portal
View Enterprise Applications in Azure Portal
Assuming that so far no AEM Enterprise Applications are present in Azure (Microsoft Entra Id)
Access The Registration Portal
Go to https://admin.hlx.page/register, enter the github url of the project or the org/site values of your site config.
Sign-in as non admin user
Sign in as a user that does not have admin permissions will show an error that it needs approval, i.e. the application needs admin consent.
Problem: Enterprise Application is not registered if a user never logs in.
Sign-in as admin user
One solution is to sign in as a user that does have admin permissions:
(note, at this point the Enterprise Application is still not registered in azure)
AEM Content Integration Registration visible in UI
If the admin logs in (without checking the checkbox and granting consent for everyone), the Enterprise application is present.
Create application using MSGraph or Powershell
Alternatively, you can create the Enterprise application via MSGraph or Powershell.
In order to make it visible in the azure UI you also need to add the WindowsAzureActiveDirectoryIntegratedApp tag. This can be done directly when creating the application.Using graph explorer:
Using powershell:
After that you still need to give admin consent, if you want a non admin user to login.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-configure?pivots=ms-graph
Review permissions
Note that the AEM Content Integration Registration (e34c45c4-0919-43e1-9436-448ad8e81552) application is only needed during registration to verify that the user has read access to the sharepoint. It has the following delegated permissions:
OpenidAllows users to sign in to the app with their work or school accounts and allows the app to see basic user profile information.
ProfileAllows the app to see your users' basic profile (e.g., name, picture, user name, email address)
Files.ReadWrite.AllAllows the app to read, create, update and delete all files the signed-in user can access.
User logged in Registration portal
After completing this initial step, the user is logged in the registration portal
Verify write access to the content source via challenge file
Download the challenge file
Before you can register (or change) the registration. You have to prove that you have write access to the respective sharepoint location. For that you need to upload a text file containing the mentioned content. This can easily be done by downloading the file and drop it into the sharepoint folder.
After that, click on Validate to continue the registration.
Connect the technical User
With the permission properly granted, you should be able to login properly to the Registration Setup UI:
Click on “Connect User” and you should see a new login window, where you want to login with your technical user. This the the AEM Content Integration is requesting for more permissions to access sharepoint:
Similar to above, and administrator needs to consent to the permissions:
After the login process, the UI should show the connected user information:
Once the user is registered, you should be able to preview a page.
Important
Changing the user's password will invalidate the grant that is established when connecting the user. This will eventually cause an error in the sidekick. In order to prevent this, you need to reconnect the user, by clicking the disconnect button then connect it again.

http://www.aem.live/docs/limits

Limits
To ensure functioning within normal parameters and system stability for all customers, we enforce limits across many dimensions. The limits are designed to prevent accidental misuse and are subject to change and often can individually be raised on a per customer basis.
If you find yourself in a situation where you think that the limits are prohibitive for your use case, contact us and let us know.
Document Naming
The URLs generated for document names will only take into account the following characters:
alphabetical, lowercase characters (a-z)
numbers (0-9)
simple dash (-)
All other characters are replaced with a single dash, and the final document name will have leading and trailing dashes removed.
The full file path for a document should not exceed 900 characters.
Supported Delivery File Types
The following file types can be delivered from the Content Bus and Media Bus:
HTML (extension-less only), JSON, MP4, PDF, SVG, JPG and PNG.
Other file types are deliverable via Code Bus, or may need to be delivered through 3rd party systems.
Content Source Limits
The following limits below are applied on preview operations for content that is ingested from Sharepoint or Google Drive. If exceeded most of them produce an error in sidekick for authors.
File Size Limits
Support for uploads of files from the content sources is provided for the following file types with the following limits.
Other file types may be uploaded through code (eg. through GitHub) or depending on the use case created on the client-side (eg. .ics, etc.).
Indexing Limits
An individual index cannot grow beyond 50k pages indexed.
Sitemap Limits
An individual sitemap file cannot grow beyond 50k pages or 50MB
Redirect Limits
The number of redirects per site cannot exceed 100k.
Number of pages per site
An individual site should not grow beyond 1 million pages. It is advisable to split up a large site into smaller ones matching business units or markets. A repoless setup allows you to reuse the same code base for multiple sites.
Rate Limits (number of preview operations per time)
Rate limits are inferred from the underlying content source (eg. Sharepoint and Google Drive). Throttled requests will receive a response with a 503 status code and an x-error HTTP header containing (429) followed by the message from the backend.
AEM Code Sync/GitHub Limits
To keep the project size manageable we limit the number and size of files that we synchronize from your GitHub repository, as well as the number of active branches/refs. If you have more files in your repo use .hlxignore to avoid syncing them..
Rate Limits (number of deploy operations per time)

Getting Started – Universal Editor Developer Tutorial
This tutorial will get you up-and-running with a new Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) project, authored in Universal Editor and publishing to Edge Delivery. In about thirty minutes, you will have created your own site and be able to create, preview, and publish your own content, styling, and add new blocks.
Prerequisites:
You have a GitHub account, and understand Git basics.
You have access to an AEM as a Cloud Service sandbox environment.
You understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You have Node/npm installed for local development.
This tutorial uses macOS, Chrome, and Visual Studio Code as the development environment and the screenshots and instructions reflect that setup. You can use a different operating system, browser, and code editor, but the UI you see and steps you must take may vary accordingly.
This tutorial uses AEM authoring as the content source. But you can choose from other content sources depending on your project’s needs.
If you are looking for a headless solution using the Universal Editor, check out the SecurBank sample app.
Use the project boilerplate to create your code repository
The fastest and easiest way to get started following AEM best practices is to create your repository using the Boilerplate GitHub repository as a template.
This tutorial uses the standard AEM project boilerplate, which is the best solution for many projects. However you can also use the Commerce project boilerplate, if your AEM Authoring with Edge Delivery Services project needs to integrate with Adobe Commerce. The steps remain the same.
Navigate to the GitHub page of the boilerplate appropriate for your project.
For most projects: https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xwalk
For projects that integrate with Adobe Commerce: https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xcom
For most projects: https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xwalk
For projects that integrate with Adobe Commerce: https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xcom
Click on Use this template and select Create a new repository.
You will need to be signed in to GitHub to see this option.
You will need to be signed in to GitHub to see this option.
By default, the repository will be assigned to you. Adobe recommends leaving the repository set to Public. Provide a repository name and description and click Create repository.
In a new tab in the same browser, navigate to https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync and click Configure.
Click Configure for the org where you created your new repository in the previous step.
On the AEM Code Sync GitHub page under Repository access, select Only select repositories, select the repository that you created in the previous step, and then click Save.
Once AEM Code Sync is installed, you receive a confirmation screen. Return to the browser tab of your new repository.
You now have your own GitHub repository for developing your own Edge Delivery Services project, based on Adobe’s best-practices boilerplate.
Connect your code to your content
Now that you have your GitHub project, you need to link the repository to your AEM authoring instance.
In your new GitHub project, click the fstab.yaml file to open it and then the Edit this file icon to edit it.
Edit the fstab.yaml file to update the mount point of your project. Replace the default Google Docs URL with the URL of your AEM as a Cloud Service authoring instance and then click Commit changes….
https://<aem-author>/bin/franklin.delivery/<owner>/<repository>/main
Changing the mount point tells Edge Delivery Services where to find the content of the site.
Add a commit message as desired and then click Commit changes, committing them directly to the main branch.
Return to the root of your repository and click on paths.json and then the Edit this file icon.​​
The default mapping will use the name of the repository. Update the default mappings as required for your project, for example /content/<site-name>/:/ and similar, and click Commit changes….
Provide your own <site-name>. You will need it in a later step.
The mappings tell Edge Delivery Services how to map the content in your AEM repository to the site URL.
Add a commit message as desired and then click Commit changes, committing them directly to the main branch.
Create and publish your site
With your GitHub project set up and linked to your AEM instance, you are ready to create and publish a new AEM site using Edge Delivery Services.
Create an AEM site
Download the latest AEM authoring with Edge Delivery Services site template from GitHub appropriate to your project.
For most projects: https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xwalk/releases
For projects that integrate with Adobe Commerce: https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xcom/releases
For most projects: https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xwalk/releases
For projects that integrate with Adobe Commerce: https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xcom/releases
Sign in to your AEM as a Cloud Service authoring instance and navigate to the Sites console and click Create → Site from template.
On the Select a site template tab of the create site wizard, click the Import button to import a new template.
Upload the AEM authoring with Edge Delivery Services site template that you downloaded from GitHub.
The template must only be uploaded once. Once uploaded it can be reused to create additional sites.
The template must only be uploaded once. Once uploaded it can be reused to create additional sites.
Once the template is imported, it appears in the wizard. Click to select it and then click Next.
Provide the following fields and tap or click Create.
Site title - Add a descriptive title for the site.
Site name - Use the <site-name> that you defined in the previous step.
GitHub URL - Use the URL of the GitHub project you created in the previous step.
AEM confirms the site creation with a dialog. Click OK to dismiss.
On the sites console, navigate to the index.html of the newly-created site and click Edit in the toolbar.
The Universal Editor opens in a new tab. You may need to tap or click Sign in with Adobe to authenticate to edit your page.
You can now edit your site using the Universal Editor.
Publishing Your New Site to Edge Delivery Services
Once you are finished editing your new site using the Universal Editor, you can publish your content.
On the sites console, select all of the pages you created for your new site and tap or click Quick publish in the toolbar.
Tap or click Publish in the confirmation dialog to start the process.
Open a new tab in the same browser and navigate to the URL of your new site.
https://main--<repository-name>--<owner>.aem.page
https://main--<repository-name>--<owner>.aem.page
See your content published.
Now that you have a working Edge Delivery Services project with AEM authoring, you can begin customizing it by creating and styling your own blocks.
Start developing styling and functionality
To get started with development, it is easiest to install the AEM Command Line Interface (CLI) and clone your repo locally through using the following.
From there change into your project folder and start your local development environment using the following.
This opens http://localhost:3000/ and you are ready to make changes.A good place to start is in the blocks folder which is where most of the styling and code lives for a project. Simply make a change in a .css or .js and you should see the changes in your browser immediately.
Once you are are ready to push your changes, simply use Git to add, commit, and push and your code to your preview (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/) and production (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live/) sites.
That’s it, you made it! Congrats, your first site is up and running. If you need help in the tutorial, please join our Discord channel or get in touch with us.

Creating Blocks Instrumented for use with the Universal Editor
Learn how to create blocks instrumented for the Universal Editor when using AEM authoring as your content source by adding components, loading component definitions in the Universal Editor, publishing pages, implementing block decoration and styles, bringing the changes to production, and verifying them.
Prerequisites
To create your blocks, you will need some existing knowledge of AEM authoring with Edge Delivery Services projects as well as the Universal Editor. You should also already have access to Edge Delivery Services and be familiar with its basics including:
You have access to an AEM Cloud Service sandbox.
You have completed the Getting Started – Universal Editor Developer Tutorial.
Adding a New Block to Your Project
Let’s build a block to render a memorable quote on your page.
To simplify this example, all changes are made to the main branch of the project repository. Of course for your actual project, you should follow development best practices by developing on a different branch and reviewing all changes via pull request before merging to main.
Adobe recommends that you develop blocks in a three-phased approach:
Create the definition and model for the block, review it, and bring it to production.
Create content with the new block.
Implement the decoration and styles for the new block.
The following quote block example follows this approach.
Create Block Definition and Model
Clone the GitHub project locally that you created in the Getting Started – Universal Editor Developer Tutorial and open it in an editor of your choice.
Microsoft Code is used in this document for illustrative purposes.
Microsoft Code is used in this document for illustrative purposes.
Edit the component-definition.json file at the root of the project and add the following definition for your new quote block and save the file.
Edit the component-models.json file at the root of the project and add the following model definition for your new quote block and save the file.
Please see the document Content Modeling for AEM authoring as your content source for more information about what is important to consider when creating content models.
Please see the document Content Modeling for AEM authoring as your content source for more information about what is important to consider when creating content models.
Edit the component-filters.json file at the root of the project and add the quote block to the filter definition to allow the block to be added to any section and save the file.
Using git, commit these changes to your main branch.
Committing to main is for illustrative purposes only. Follow best practices and use a pull request for actual project work.

Create content with the block
Now that your basic quote block is defined and committed to the sample project, you can add a quote block to an existing page.
In a browser, sign into AEM as a Cloud Service. Using the Sites console, navigate to the site that you created in the Getting Started – Universal Editor Developer Tutorial and select a page.
In this case, index is used for illustrative purposes.
In this case, index is used for illustrative purposes.
Tap or click Edit in the toolbar of the console and the Universal Editor opens.
In order to load the page, you may need to tap or click Sign in with Adobe to authenticate to AEM in the Universal Editor.
In order to load the page, you may need to tap or click Sign in with Adobe to authenticate to AEM in the Universal Editor.
In the Universal Editor, select a section. In the properties panel, tap or click the Add icon and then select your new Quote block from the menu.
The Add icon is a plus symbol.
You know that you have selected a section if the blue outline of the selected object has a tab labeled Section.
In this example, tapping or clicking slightly above the Lorem Ipsum heading selects a section containing the heading and lorem ipsum text.
The Add icon is a plus symbol.
You know that you have selected a section if the blue outline of the selected object has a tab labeled Section.
In this example, tapping or clicking slightly above the Lorem Ipsum heading selects a section containing the heading and lorem ipsum text.
The page is reloaded and the quote block is added to the bottom of the selected section with the default content specified in the component-definitions.json file.
The quote block can be selected and edited as any other block either in-place or in the properties panel.
Styling will be applied in a further step.
The quote block can be selected and edited as any other block either in-place or in the properties panel.
Styling will be applied in a further step.
Once you are satisfied with the content of your quote, you can publish the page by tapping or clicking the Publish button in the toolbar of the Universal Editor.
Verify that the content was published by navigating to the published page. The link will be similar to https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page
Style the block
Now that you have a working quote block you can apply styling to it.
Return to the editor for your project.
Create a quote folder under the blocks folder.
In the new quote folder, add a quote.js file to implement block decoration by adding the following JavaScript and save the file.
In the quote folder, add a quote.css file to define the styling for the block by adding the following CSS code and save the file.
Using git, commit these changes to your main branch.
Committing to main is for illustrative purposes only. Follow best practices and use a pull request for actual project work.
Committing to main is for illustrative purposes only. Follow best practices and use a pull request for actual project work.
Return to your browser tab of the Universal Editor where you were editing the page of your project and reload the page to view your styled block.
See the now styled quote block on the page.
Verify that the changes were pushed to production by navigating to the published page. The link will be similar to https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page
Congratulations! You now have a fully working and styled quote block. You can use this example as a basis for designing your own project-specific blocks.
Block options
If you need a block to look or behave slightly differently based on certain circumstances (but not different enough to become a new block in itself), you can let authors choose from block options.
By adding a classes property to the block, the property is rendered in the table header for simple blocks, or as value list for items in a container block.
Using other working branches
This guide had you commit directly to the main branch for simplicity’s sake. For experimentation in a sample repository, this is usually not an issue. For actual project work, you should follow development best practices by developing on a different branch and reviewing all changes via pull request before merging to main.
When you are not developing on the main branch, you can append ?ref=<branch> in the Universal Editor location bar to load the page from your branch. <branch> is the branch name as it would be used for your project’s preview or live URLs, e.g. https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page.
Blocks for AEM authoring and document-based authoring
On certain projects, you may want to support both AEM authoring as your content source using the Universal Editor as well as document-based authoring. To minimize development time and ensure the same site experience, you can create one set of blocks to support both use cases.
To do this, you must use the same content modeling approach for both your AEM authoring setup as well as your document-based authoring setup.
Approach
In AEM authoring, you declare a model and provide naming conventions. Data is then rendered in table-like block structures using Edge Delivery in the same way as if the table would have been created manually using document-based authoring.
To achieve this, certain assumptions are made such as for a simple block like a teaser that all properties and groups of properties are rendered in 1…n rows with a single column each. For blocks that have 1…n items (such as carousel and cards) the items are appended after these rows with one row each and a column for each property/group of properties.
If you follow the same approach for document-based authoring you can reuse your AEM authoring blocks.
Example
The following example of a teaser block follows the recommended approach and could be used between document-based and AEM authoring.
With this data:
You get this markup:
And it will be turned into this table representation:
Next steps
Now that you know how to create blocks, it is essential to understand how to model content in a semantic way to achieve a lean developer experience.

Content modeling for AEM authoring projects
Learn how content modeling works for projects using AEM authoring as a content source and how to model your own content.
Prerequisites
Projects using AEM authoring as a content source inherit the majority of the mechanics of any other Edge Delivery Services project, independent of the content source or authoring method.
Before you begin modeling content for your project, make sure you first read the following documentation.
Getting Started – Universal Editor Developer Tutorial
Markup, Sections, Blocks, and Auto Blocking
Block Collection
It is essential to understand those concepts in order to create a compelling content model that works in a content source-agnostic way. This document provides details about the mechanics implemented specifically for AEM authoring.
Default content
Default content is content an author intuitively would put on a page without adding any additional semantics. This includes text, headings, links, and images. Such content is self-explanatory in its function and purpose.
In AEM, this content is implemented as components with very simple, pre-defined models, which include everything that can be serialized in Markdown and HTML.
Text: Rich text (including list elements and strong or italic text)
Title: Text, type (h1-h6)
Image: Source, description
Button: Text, title, url, type (default, primary, secondary)
The model of these components is part of the boilerplate for projects with AEM authoring as the content source.
Blocks
Blocks are used to create richer content with specific styles and functionality. In contrast to default content, blocks do require additional semantics.
Blocks are essentially pieces of content decorated by JavaScript and styled with a stylesheet.
Block model definition
When using AEM authoring as your content source, the content of blocks must be modelled explicitly in order to provide the author the interface to create content. Essentially you need to create a model so the authoring UI knows what options to present to the author based on the block.
The component-models.json file defines the model of blocks. The fields defined in the component model are persisted as properties in AEM and rendered as cells in the table that makes up a block.
Note that not every block must have a model. Some blocks are simply containers for a list of children, where each child has its own model.
It is also necessary to define which blocks exist and can be added to a page using the Universal Editor. The component-definitions.json file lists the components as they are made available by the Universal Editor.
It is possible to use one model for many blocks. For example, some blocks may share a model that defines a text and image.
For each block, the developer:
Must use the core/franklin/components/block/v1/block resource type, the generic implementation of the block logic in AEM.
Must define the block name, which will be rendered in the block’s table header.
The block name is used to fetch the right style and script to decorate the block.
The block name is used to fetch the right style and script to decorate the block.
Can define a model ID.
The model ID is a reference to the component’s model, which defines the fields available to the author in the properties panel.
The model ID is a reference to the component’s model, which defines the fields available to the author in the properties panel.
Can define a filter ID.
The filter ID is a reference to the component’s filter, which allows to change the authoring behavior, for example by limiting which children can be added to the block or section, or which RTE features are enabled.
The filter ID is a reference to the component’s filter, which allows to change the authoring behavior, for example by limiting which children can be added to the block or section, or which RTE features are enabled.
All of this information is stored in AEM when a block is added to a page. If either the resource type or block name are missing, the block will not render on the page.
WARNING: While possible, it is not necessary or recommended to implement custom AEM components. The components for Edge Delivery Services provided by AEM are sufficient and offer certain guard rails to ease development.
The components provided by AEM render a markup that can be consumed by helix-html2md when publishing to Edge Delivery Services and by aem.js when loading a page in the Universal Editor. The markup is the stable contract between AEM and the other parts of the system, and does not allow for customizations. For this reason, projects must not change the components and must not use custom components.
Block structure
The properties of blocks are defined in the component models and persisted as such in AEM. Properties are rendered as cells in the block’s table-like structure.
Simple blocks
In the simplest form, a block renders each property in a single row/column in the order the properties are defined in the model.
In the following example, the image is defined first in the model and the text second. They are thus rendered with the image first and text second.
With this data:
You get this markup:
And it will be turned into this table representation:
You may notice that some types of values allow inferring semantics in the markup, and properties are combined into single cells. This behavior is described in the section Type inference.
Key-value block
In many cases, it is recommended to decorate the rendered semantic markup, add CSS class names, add new nodes or move them around in the DOM, and apply styles.
In other cases however, the block is read as a key-value pair-like configuration.
An example of this is the section metadata. In this use case, the block can be configured to render as a key-value pair table. Please see the section Sections and Section Metadata for more information.
With this data:
You get this markup:
And it will be turned into this table representation:
Container blocks
Both of the previous structures have a single dimension: the list of properties. Container blocks allow adding children (usually of the same type or model) and hence are two-dimensional. These blocks still support their own properties rendered as rows with a single column first. But they also allow adding children, for which each item is rendered as a row and each property as a column within that row.
In the following example, a block accepts a list of linked icons as children, where each linked icon has an image and a link. Notice the filter ID set in the data of the block in order to reference the filter configuration.
With this data:
You get this markup:
And it will be turned into this table representation:
Creating semantic content models for blocks
With the mechanics of block structure explained, it is possible to create a content model that maps content persisted in AEM one-to-one to the delivery tier.
Early in every project, a content model must be carefully considered for every block. It must be agnostic to the content source and authoring experience in order to allow authors to switch or combine them while reusing block implementations and styles. More details and general guidance can be found in David’s Model (take 2). More specifically, the block collection contains an extensive set of content models for specific use cases of common user interface patterns.
For AEM authoring as your content source, this raises the question how to serve a compelling semantic content model when the information is authored with forms composed of multiple fields instead of editing semantic markup in-context like rich text.
To solve this problem, there are three methods that facilitate creating a compelling content model:
Type Inference
Field Collapse
Element Grouping
NOTE: Block implementations can deconstruct the content and replace the block with a client-side-rendered DOM. While this is possible and intuitive for a developer, it is not the best practice for Edge Delivery Services.
Type inference
For some values we can infer the semantic meaning from the values itself. Such values include:
Images - If a reference to a resource in AEM is an asset with a MIME type starting with image/, the reference is rendered as <picture><img src="${reference}"></picture>.
Links - If a reference exists in AEM and is not an image, or if the value starts with https?:// or #, the reference is rendered as <a href="${reference}">${reference}</a>.
Rich text - If a trimmed value starts with a paragraph (p, ul, ol, h1-h6, etc.), the value is rendered as rich text.
Class names - The classes property is treated as block options and rendered in the table header for simple blocks, or as value list for items in a container block. It is useful if you want to style a block differently, but don’t need to create an entirely new block.
Value lists - If a value is a multi-value property and the first value is none of the previous, all values are concatenated as a comma-separated list.
Everything else will be rendered as plain text.
Field collapse
Field collapse is the mechanism to combine multiple field values into a single semantic element based on a naming convention using the suffixes Title, Type, MimeType, Alt, and Text (all case sensitive). Any property ending with any of those suffixes will not be considered a value, but rather as an attribute of another property.

And it will be turned into this table representation:
Headings
With this data:
You get this markup:
<h2>Getting started</h2>
And it will be turned into this table representation:
## Getting started
Element grouping
While field collapse is about combining multiple properties into a single semantic element, element grouping is about concatenating multiple semantic elements into a single cell. This is particularly helpful for use cases where the author should be restricted in the type and number of elements that they can create.
For example, a teaser component may allow the author to only create a subtitle, title, and a single paragraph description combined with a maximum of two call-to-action buttons. Grouping these elements together yields a semantic markup that can be styled without further action.
Element grouping uses a naming convention, where the group name is separated from each property in the group by an underscore. Field collapse of the properties in a group works as previously described.

You get this markup:
And it will be turned into this table representation:
Sections and section metadata
The same way a developer can define and model multiple blocks, they can define different sections.
The content model of Edge Delivery Services deliberately allows only a single level of nesting, which is any default content or block contained by a section. This means in order to have more complex visual components that can contain other components, they have to be modelled as sections and combined together using auto-blocking client side. Typical examples of this are tabs and collapsible sections like accordions.
A section can be defined in the same way as a block, but with the resource type of core/franklin/components/section/v1/section. Sections can have a name and a filter ID, which are used by the Universal Editor only, as well as a model ID, which is used to render the section metadata. The model is in this way the model of the section metadata block, which will automatically be appended to a section as a key-value block if it is not empty.
The model ID and filter ID of the default section is section. It can be used to alter the behavior of the default section. The following example adds some styles and a background image to the section metadata model.
The following example defines a tab section, which can be used to create a tabs block by combining consecutive sections with a tab title data attribute into a tabs block during auto-blocking.
Page metadata
Documents can have a page metadata block, which is used to define which <meta> elements are rendered in the <head> of a page. The page properties of pages in AEM as a Cloud Service map to those that are available out-of-the-box for Edge Delivery Services, like title, description, keywords, etc.
Before further exploring how to define your own metadata, please review the following documents to understand the concept of page metadata first.
Metadata
Bulk metadata
It is also possible to define additional page metadata in two ways.
Metadata spreadsheets
It is possible to define metadata on a per path or per path pattern basis in a table-like way in AEM as a Cloud Service. There is an authoring UI for table-like data available that is similar to Excel or Google Sheets.
For further details, please see the document Using Spreadsheets to Manage Tabular Data for more information.
Page properties
Many of the default page properties available in AEM are mapped to the respective page metadata in a document. That includes for example title, description, robots, canonical url or keywords. Some AEM-specific properties are available as well:
cq:lastModified as modified-time in ISO8601 format
The time the document was last published as published-time in ISO8601 format
cq:tags as cq-tags as a comma-separated list of the tag IDs.
It is also possible to define a component model for custom page metadata, which will be made available to the author in the Universal Editor.
To do so, create a component model with the ID page-metadata.

Managing tabular data with AEM authoring as your content source
For any AEM with Edge Delivery Services site, there is a need to maintain lists of tabular data such as for key-value mappings. These can be lists of many different values such as metadata and redirects. Edge Deliver Services allows you to maintain such tabular lists using an intuitive tool: the spreadsheet. AEM translates these spreadsheets into JSON files that can easily be consumed by your website or web application.
Common use cases include:
Placeholders
Metadata
Headers
Redirects
Configurations such as for CDN setups
In addition, you can create your spreadsheets of any structure to store mappings for your own purposes.
This document uses the example of redirects to illustrate how to create such spreadsheets. See the previously-linked topics in the Edge Delivery Services documentation for details of each use case.
TIP: For more information on how spreadsheets in general work with Edge Delivery Services, please see the document Spreadsheets and JSON.
TIP: Spreadsheets should only be used to maintain tabular data. For storing structured data, check out AEM’s headless features.
Creating a spreadsheet
In this example, you will create a spreadsheet to manage redirects for your project with AEM authoring as your content source. The same steps apply to other spreadsheet types that you wish to create.
Sign in to your AEM as a Cloud Service authoring instance, go to the Sites console, and navigate to the root of the site which requires a spreadsheet. Tap or click Create → Page.
On the Template tab of the create page wizard, tap or click the Redirects template to select it and then tap or click Next.
The Properties tab of the wizard presents the default values for the redirects spreadsheet. Tap or click Create.
Title - Leave this value as-is.
Columns - The minimum columns needed for redirects are prepopulated.
source - The page to be redirected
destination - The page to redirect to
Title - Leave this value as-is.
Columns - The minimum columns needed for redirects are prepopulated.
source - The page to be redirected
destination - The page to redirect to
source - The page to be redirected
destination - The page to redirect to
In the Success dialog, tap or click Open.
A new tab opens with the spreadsheet loaded into an editor with the predefined source and destination columns. To define your redirects, tap or click the empty row of the source column. Changes are saved automatically as you edit the spreadsheet.
The source is relative to the domain of your website, so it only contains the relative path.
The destination can be either a fully qualified URL if you are redirecting to a different website, or it can be a relative path if you are redirecting within your own website.
Use the tab-key to move focus to the next cell.
The editor adds new rows to the spreadsheet as necessary.
To delete or move a row, use the Delete icon at the end of each row and the drag handles at the beginning of each row, respectively.
Importing spreadsheet data
In addition to editing spreadsheets in the AEM Page Editor, you can also import data from a CSV file.
When editing your spreadsheet in AEM, tap or click the Upload button at the top-left of the screen.
In the drop-down, select how you would like to import your data.
Replace Doc to replace the content of the entire spreadsheet with the content of the CSV file you will upload.
Append To Doc to append the data of the CSV file you will upload to the existing spreadsheet contents.
Replace Doc to replace the content of the entire spreadsheet with the content of the CSV file you will upload.
Append To Doc to append the data of the CSV file you will upload to the existing spreadsheet contents.
In the dialog that opens, select your CSV file and then tap or click Open.
A dialog opens as the import is processed. Once complete, the data in the CSV file is added to or replaces the content of the spreadsheet. If any errors are encountered such as a mismatch of columns, they are reported so you can correct your CSV file.
NOTE: Keep the following in mind when importing data.
The headings in the CSV file must match the columns in the spreadsheet exactly.
Importing the entire CSV does not modify the column headings, only the content rows.
If you need to update the columns, you must do that in the AEM Page Editor before performing the import of the CSV.
A CSV file can not be larger than 10 MB for import.
Depending on your selection of mode, you can also create, replace, or append to spreadsheets using a CSV and a cURL command similar to the following.
The call returns an HTML page with information about the job ID.
Message | Job(Id:2024/9/18/15/27/5cb0cacc-585d-4176-b018-b684ad2dfd02_90) created successfully. Please check status at Async Job Status Navigation.
You can use the Jobs console to view the status of the job or use the ID returned to query it.
https://<aem-instance>/bin/asynccommand?optype=JOBINF&jobid=2024/10/24/14/1/8da63f9e-066b-4134-95c9-21a9c57836a5_1
Publishing a spreadsheet paths.json
In order for AEM to be able to publish the data in your spreadsheet, you additionally need to update the paths.json file of your project.
Open the root of your project in GitHub.
Tap or click the paths.json file to open its details and then the Edit icon.
Add a line to map your new spreadsheet to a redirects.json resource.
NOTE This paths.json entry is based on the example of creating redirects using tabular data. Make sure to update the path appropriate to the type of spreadsheet you are creating.
Click Commit changes… to save the changes to main.
Either commit to main or create a pull request as per your process.
Either commit to main or create a pull request as per your process.
When you are finished defining your redirects and you updated the path mapping, return to the Sites console.
Tap or click to select the redirects spreadsheet that you created in the console and then tap or click Quick Publish in the actions bar to publish the spreadsheet.
In the Quick Publish dialog, tap or click Publish.
A banner confirms the publication.
The redirects spreadsheet is now published and publicly-accessible.
TIP: For more information about path mappings, please see the document Path Mapping for Edge Delivery Services.
Other spreadsheet types
Now that you know how to create a redirects spreadsheet, you can create any other standard spreadsheet type:
Placeholders
Metadata
Headers
Configuration - Such as for cache invalidation
Taxonomy
Configuration
Simply follow the same steps in the sections Create Spreadsheet and Publish paths.json and choose the appropriate template and update the paths.json file appropriately.
For Configuration, Headers and Metadata make sure to add a mapping to publish them to their default locations:
Configuration: /.helix/config.json
Headers: /.helix/headers.json
Metadata: /metadata.json
Taxonomy: Please see the document Managing Taxonomy Data for more information.
Additionally, you can create your own spreadsheet with arbitrary columns for your own use.
NOTE: You do not need to create a spreadsheet to manage indexing for AEM as a Cloud Service with Edge Delivery Services projects. If you wish to create your own indices, please follow this documentation to create your own helix-query.yaml file.
Creating your own spreadsheet
Follow the same steps in the section Create Spreadsheet.
When selecting the template, choose Spreadsheet.
In the Properties tab of the wizard, you can add your own columns.
In the Columns section, tap or click Add to add a new column.
Provide a name for the column.
Remove or reorganize the columns using the Delete and drag handle icons, respectively.
In the Columns section, tap or click Add to add a new column.
Provide a name for the column.

Configuration templates
When using AEM as your content authoring source, you can use the Sites console to easily create and manage your project configuration by using a configuration template. By leveraging the powerful features of the Sites console, your configuration can be inherited across sites using Multi-site management (MSM).
Prerequisites
You must have already created your Edge Delivery Services project with AEM as your authoring source. Please see the tutorial for more information.
Creating a configuration
Sign in to your AEM as a Cloud Service authoring instance, go to the Sites console, and navigate to the root of the site where you wish to create a configuration. Tap or click Create → Page.
On the Template tab of the create page wizard, tap or click the Configuration template to select it and then tap or click Next.
Please see the document Managing tabular data with AEM authoring as your content source for more information about templates.
Please see the document Managing tabular data with AEM authoring as your content source for more information about templates.
The Properties tab of the wizard allows you to specify a Title for the configuration. The default value of Configuration can typically be left as-is. Tap or click Create.
In the Success dialog, tap or click Done.
The configuration is created in the site root.
Editing a configuration

Configuration Inheritance
When using AEM as your authoring source, project configuration templates fully support inheritance.
For example, you may have a single API key for your CDN for your organization. However your individual, localized sites would have different host names. You can set the API key in the blueprint, which is rolled out to your localized sites. For each site, you can break inheritance for the host name and set it for each site.
For more information about blueprints, inheritance, and MSM, please see the document Reusing Content: Multi Site Manager and Live Copy.
For more information on how to set up MSM for your Edge Delivery Services with AEM authoring project, please see the document Multi site management with AEM authoring as your content source.
For more information on breaking and reinstating inheritance in the Sites Console, please see the document Editing Page Properties.
Configuration templates and configuration spreadsheets
Configuration templates support a reasonable subset of configurations that are common and possible. There may be edge cases that configuration templates do not cover.
If you find that the configuration template does not support your use case you must first delete the configuration you created. You then have two options:
Create a spreadsheet called configuration and manage your settings in that spreadsheet.
Activate the Configuration Service and manage your settings using the service.

Multi site management with AEM authoring as your content source
Multi Site Manager (MSM) and its Live Copy features enable you to use the same site content in multiple locations, while allowing for variations. You can author content once and create Live Copies. MSM maintains live relationships between your source content and its Live Copies so that when you change the source content, the source and Live Copies can be synchronized.
You can use MSM to create an entire content structure for your brand across locales and languages, authoring the content centrally. Your localized sites can then each be delivered by Edge Delivery Services, leveraging a central code base.
In order to leverage MSM on Edge Delivery Services with AEM authoring, you must enable the repoless feature.
Requirements
To configure MSM, you must first complete the following tasks:
This document assumes that you have already created a site for your project based on the Getting Started – Universal Editor Developer Tutorial
You must have already enabled the repoless feature for your project.
Use case
This document assumes that you have already created a basic localized site structure for your project. It uses the following structure for the website brand with a presence in Switzerland and Germany as an example.
Content in language-masters is the source of Live Copies for the localized sites: Germany (de) and Switzerland (ch). The goal of this document is to create Edge Delivery Services sites that all use the same code base for each localized site.
Configuration
There are several steps to configuring the MSM repoless use case.
Update AEM site configurations.
Create new Edge Delivery Services sites for your localized pages.
Update cloud configuration in AEM for your localized sites.
This document details these steps.
Update AEM site configurations
Configurations can be thought of as workspaces that can be used to gather groups of settings and their associated content for organizational purposes. When you create a site in AEM, a configuration is automatically created for it.
You generally want to share certain content between sites such as:
Templates created from content in the blueprint
Content Fragment models, persisted, queries etc.
You can create additional configurations to facilitate such sharing. For the website use case, we would need configurations for the following paths.
That is, you will have a configuration for the root of the website brand’s content (/content/website) used by the blueprints and a configuration used by each localized site (Switzerland and Germany).
Sign into your AEM authoring instance.
Navigate to the Configuration Browser by going to Tools → General → Configuration Browser.
Select the configuration that was automatically created for your project (in this case website) and then tap or click Create in the toolbar.
In the Create Configuration dialog, provide a descriptive Name for your localized site (such as Switzerland) and for the Title use the same title of the localized size (in this case ch).
Select the Cloud Configuration feature and any additional features you may need for your project such as Editable Templates.
Tap or click Create.
Create configurations for each localized site you need. In the case of website, you would need to create a configuration for de as well alongside the ch configuration.
Once the configurations are created, you need to ensure that the localized sites use them.
Sign into your AEM authoring instance.
Navigate to the Sites console by going to Navigation → Sites.
Select the localized site such as Switzerland.
Tap or click Properties in the tool bar.
In the page properties window, select the Advanced tab and under the Configuration heading, unselect the option Inherited from /content/website, where website is the site root.
In Cloud Configuration field, use the path browser to select the configuration you created for your localized site such as Switzerland under /conf/website/ch.
Tap or click Save & Close.
Assign the respective configurations to the additional localized sites. In the case of website, you would need to assign the /conf/website/de configuration to the Germany site as well.
Create new Edge Delivery Services sites for your localized pages
To connect more sites to Edge Delivery Services for a multi-region, multi-language site setup, you must set up a new aem.live site for each of your AEM MSM sites. There is a 1:1 relationship between AEM MSM sites and aem.live sites with a shared Git repository and code base.
For this example, we will create the site website-ch for the Swiss presence of website, whose localized content is under the AEM path /content/website/ch.
Retrieve your auth token and the technical account for your program.
Please see the document Reusing Code Across Sites for details on how to obtain your access token and the technical account for your program.
Please see the document Reusing Code Across Sites for details on how to obtain your access token and the technical account for your program.
Create a new site by making the following call to the configuration service. Please consider:
The project name in the POST URL must be the new site name you are creating. In this example, it is website-ch.
The code configuration should be the same as you used for the initial project creation.
The content → source → url must be adapted to the name of the new site you are creating. In this example, it is website-ch.
I.e., the site name in POST URL and the content → source → url must be the same.
Adapt the admin block to define the users who should have full administrative access to the site.
It is an array of email addresses.
The wildcard * can be used.
See the document Configuring Authentication for Authors for more information.

Add the path mapping for your new site by making the following call to the configuration service.
Verify that the public configuration of your new site is working by calling https://main--website-ch--<your-github-org>.aem.page/config.json and verifying the content of the returned JSON.
Repeat the steps to create additional localized sites. In the case of website, you would need to create a website-de site for the German presence as well.
Update Cloud Configurations in AEM for Your Localized Pages
Your pages in AEM must be configured to use the new Edge Delivery Sites you created in the previous section for your localized presence. In this example, content under /content/website/ch needs to know to use the website-ch site you created. Similarly content under /content/website/de needs to use the website-de site.
Sign into the AEM author instance and go to Tools → Cloud Services → Edge Delivery Services Configuration.
Select the configuration that was automatically created for your project and then the folder that was created for the localized page. In this case, that would be Switzerland (ch).
Tap or click Create > Configuration in the tool bar.
In the Edge Delivery Services Configuration window:
Provide your GitHub organization in the Organization field.
Change the site name to the name of the site you created in the previous section. In this case, that would be website-ch.
Change project type to aem.live with repoless config setup.
Provide your GitHub organization in the Organization field.
Change the site name to the name of the site you created in the previous section. In this case, that would be website-ch.
Change project type to aem.live with repoless config setup.
Tap or click Save & Close.
Verify your setup
Now that you have made all of the necessary configuration changes, verify that everything is working as expected.
Sign into your AEM authoring instance.
Navigate to the Sites console by going to Navigation → Sites.
Select the localized site such as Switzerland.
Tap or click Edit in the toolbar.
Ensure that the page properly renders in the Universal Editor and uses the same code as your site root.
Make a change to the page and re-publish.
Visit your new Edge Delivery Services site for that localized page at https://main--website-ch--<your-github-org>.aem.page.
If you see the changes that you made, your MSM setup is working properly.

Reusing code across sites with AEM authoring as your content source
By default, AEM is tightly bound to your code repository, which meets the majority of use cases. However you may have multiple sites that differ mostly in their content, but could leverage the same code base.
Rather than creating multiple GitHub repositories and running each site off a dedicated GitHub repository while keeping them in sync, AEM supports running multiple sites from the same codebase.
This simplified setup, which eliminates the need for code replication is also known as “repoless”, because all but your first site don’t need a GitHub repository of their own.
If your project requires the repoless flexibility of code reuse across sites, you can activate the feature.
Regardless of how many sites you want to ultimately create in a repoless fashion, you must create your first site, which serves as your base site. This document explains how to create your first site for repoless use.
Prerequisites
To take advantage of this feature, make sure you have done the following.
Your site is already fully set up by following the document Getting Started – Universal Editor Developer Tutorial.
You are running AEM as a Cloud Service 2025.4 at a minimum.
You will also need to ask Adobe to configure the following items for you. Reach out via your Slack channel or raise a support issue to request Adobe to make these changes:
Ask to activate the aem.live configuration service (as described in the prerequisites of this article) for your environment and that you are configured as an administrator.
Ask Adobe to create the org for you.
Activate repoless feature
There are several steps to activate repoless functionality for your project. Please substitute your own site and GitHub org information appropriately.
Retrieve access token
Set up configuration service
Add site configuration and technical account
Update AEM configuration
Authenticate site
This document details each of these steps.
Retrieve access token
You will first need an access token to use the configuration service and configure it for the repoless use case.
Go to https://admin.hlx.page/login and use the login_adobe address to login with the Adobe identity provider.
You will be forwarded to https://admin.hlx.page/profile.
By using your browser’s developer tools, copy the value of the x-auth-token either from the JSON web token cookie that the admin.hlx.page page sets.
Once you have your access token, it can be passed in the header of cURL requests in the following format.
--header 'x-auth-token: <your-token>'
Configure your content and code sources
The configuration service needs to know where to find your code and AEM content. Execute this cURL command to create or update a site to use your code and AEM content.
Add path mapping for site configuration and set technical account
You need to create a site configuration and add it to your path mapping.
Create a new page at the root of your site and choose the Configuration template.
You can leave the configuration empty with only the predefined key and value columns. You only need to create it.
You can leave the configuration empty with only the predefined key and value columns. You only need to create it.
Create a mapping in the public configuration to the site configuration using a cURL command similar to the following.
Validate that the public configuration has been set and is available with a cURL command similar to the following.curl 'https://main--<your-aem-project>--<your-github-org>.aem.live/config.json'
Once the site configuration is mapped, you can configure access control by defining your technical account so it has privileges to publish.
Sign into the AEM author instance and go to Tools → Cloud Services → Edge Delivery Services Configuration and select the configuration that was automatically created for your site and tap or click Properties in the tool bar.
In the Edge Delivery Services Configuration window, select the Authentication tab and copy the value for the technical account ID.
It will look similar to <tech-account-id>@techacct.adobe.com
The technical account is the same for all sites on a single AEM author environment.
It will look similar to <tech-account-id>@techacct.adobe.com
The technical account is the same for all sites on a single AEM author environment.
Set the technical account for your repoless configuration with a cURL command similar to the following, using the technical account ID that you copied.
Adapt the admin block to define the users who should have full administrative access to the site.
It is an array of email addresses.
The wildcard * can be used.
See the document Configuring Authentication for Authors for more information.

See the document Configuring Authentication for Authors for more information.
It is an array of email addresses.
The wildcard * can be used.
See the document Configuring Authentication for Authors for more information.
Since you now use the configuration service, you can remove fstab.yaml and paths.json from your Git repository.
NOTE: By using the configuration service and exposing the path mapping via config.json, the path.json file is ignored.
Once AEM is configured for repoless use, you must use the configuration service and provide a valid config.json with the paths mapping.
Update AEM configuration
Now you are ready to make the necessary changes to your Edge Delivery Services in AEM.
Sign into the AEM author instance and go to Tools → Cloud Services → Edge Delivery Services Configuration and select the configuration that was automatically created for your site and tap or click Properties in the tool bar.
In the Edge Delivery Services Configuration window, change project type to aem.live with repoless config setup and tap or click Save & Close.
Return to your site using the Universal Editor and ensure that it still renders properly.
Modify some of your content and re-publish.
Visit your published site at https://main--<your-aem-project>--<your-github-org>.aem.page/ and verify that the changes are properly reflected.
Your project is now set up for repoless use.
Troubleshooting
The most common issue encountered after configuring the repoless use case is that pages in the Universal Editor no longer render or you receive a white page or a generic AEM as a Cloud Service error message. In such cases:
View the source of the rendered page.
Is there actually something rendered (correct HTML head with scripts.js, aem.js, and editor-related JSON files)?
Is there actually something rendered (correct HTML head with scripts.js, aem.js, and editor-related JSON files)?
Check the AEM error.log of the author instance for exceptions.
The most common issue is the page component fails with 404 errors.
config.json or paths.json can not be loaded
component-definition.json etc. can not be loaded

You may wish to set up a site for your production environment separate from your staging environment. Setting up a second site for a separate staging and production setup is similar to the setup required for multi site management. In fact, it can be combined with MSM site structures if required.
This document uses the typical example of separate staging and production environments. You can create separate environments for any environments you wish.
Requirements
To configure repoless stage and production environments, you must first complete the following tasks:
This document assumes that you have already created a site for your project based on the Getting Started – Universal Editor Developer Tutorial
You must have already enabled the repoless feature for your project.
Configuration
This document describes how to set up a separate production site for your project using the same code base. The following assumptions are made.
The staging site is already set up and you now want to create a configuration for the production site.
The content structure in AEM authoring is similar.
The same path mappings will be used for staging and production.
In this example, we are assuming that a production site has already been created for the project called wknd whose GitHub repo is also called wknd.
There are two steps to configuring a separate production site.
Create new Edge Delivery Services sites for your production environment.
Update cloud configuration in AEM for your production site.
This document details these configuration steps.
Create New Edge Delivery Services Sites for Your Production Environment
Retrieve your auth token and the technical account for your program.
Please see the document Reusing Code Across Sites for details on how to obtain your access token and the technical account for your program.
Please see the document Reusing Code Across Sites for details on how to obtain your access token and the technical account for your program.
Create a new site by making the following call to the configuration service. Please consider:
The project name in the POST URL must be the new site name you are creating. In this example, it is website-prod.
The code configuration should be the same as you used for the initial project creation.
The content → source → url must be adapted to the name of the new site you are creating. In this example, it is website-prod.
I.e., the site name in POST URL and the content → source → url must be the same.
Adapt the admin block to define the users who should have full administrative access to the site.
It is an array of email addresses.
The wildcard * can be used.
See the document Configuring Authentication for Authors for more information.

See the document Configuring Authentication for Authors for more information.
Add the path mapping for your new site by making the following call to the configuration service.
Verify that the public configuration of your new site is working by calling https://main--website-prod--<your-github-org>.aem.page/config.json and verifying the content of the returned JSON.
Update Cloud Configurations in AEM for Your Production Site
Your production AEM must be configured to use the new Edge Delivery Sites you created in the previous section for a dedicated production site. In this example, content under /content/website on your production environment needs to know to use the website-prod site you created.
Sign into the AEM production instance and go to Tools → Cloud Services → Edge Delivery Services Configuration.
Select the configuration that was automatically created for your project.
Tap or click Properties in the tool bar.
In the Edge Delivery Services Configuration window:
Provide your GitHub organization in the Organization field.
Change the site name to the name of the site you created in the previous section. In this case, that would be website-prod.
Change project type to aem.live with repoless config setup.
Provide your GitHub organization in the Organization field.
Change the site name to the name of the site you created in the previous section. In this case, that would be website-prod.
Change project type to aem.live with repoless config setup.
Tap or click Save & Close.
Verify Your Setup
Now that you have made all of the necessary configuration changes, verify that everything is working as expected.
Sign into your AEM production authoring instance.
Navigate to the Sites console by going to Navigation → Sites.
Select a page in your site.
Tap or click Edit in the toolbar.
Ensure that the page properly renders in the Universal Editor and uses the same code as your site root.
Make a change to the page and re-publish.
Visit your new Edge Delivery Services site for that page at https://main--website-prod--<your-github-org>.aem.page.
If you see the changes that you made, your separate production site setup is working properly.
Usage
Once you have configured your project with repoless staging and production environments, you can manage code for them independently. The following diagram illustrates the relationship of the content in your various environments in AEM, Edge Delivery Services sites, and your GitHub repositories.

https://www.aem.live/developer/authentication-setup-site-for-aem-authoring

Site authentication for your visitors when using AEM Authoring
aem.live supports token-based authentication. When using AEM authoring as your content source, site authentication is usually applied to both the preview and publish sites, but can also be configured to only protect either site individually.
NOTE: If you choose to activate site authentication, you must configure it in your AEM authoring environments as well
Requirements
To configure site authentication for use with content authoring, you must first complete the following tasks:
This document assumes that you have already created a site for your project based on the Getting Started – Universal Editor Developer Tutorial.
You must have already enabled the repoless feature for your project.
Configure Site Authentication
You must first configure site authentication for your site. While doing this, take note of the following information:
The ID of the technical account
Your site authentication token
These items are required to complete the configuration of site authentication for your AEM authoring environment.
Configure Authoring Environment
Once site authentication is configured, you can enable it in your AEM authoring environment.
Sign into the AEM author instance and go to Tools → Cloud Services → Edge Delivery Services Configuration and select the configuration that was automatically created for your site and tap or click Properties in the tool bar.
In the Edge Delivery Services Configuration window, select the Authentication tab, provide the Site Authentication Token, which you copied previously.
Verify that the The technical account ID field matches the one you copied previously.
This field is read-only and predefined.
The technical account is the same for all sites on a single AEM author environment.
This field is read-only and predefined.

https://www.aem.live/developer/authoring-path-mapping

Path mapping for AEM authoring as your content source
To be able to use AEM authoring as your content source and publish your content to Edge Delivery Services, you must set up your project’s path mapping. This mapping has two purposes.
It maps and creates a relationship between page paths used on your AEM authoring instance and the public page paths used on your website.
It controls which content (pages, sheets, assets, etc.) are published to Edge Delivery Services.
The path mapping must be configured for each project individually and according to the project’s content and URL structure. It is used by AEM during content publishing and while editing content in the Universal Editor.
Configuration format
The format of the path mapping configuration contains two sections (mappings and includes) similar to the following example.
mappings
The mappings configuration holds an array of internal paths (on the AEM authoring instance) and external URL paths (on the public website).
The format is <internal paths>:<external path>. It typically consists of a minimum of two entries.
The first entry from the example is the path mapping of the website pages.
The second entry controls the mapping of the .helix/config.json to the corresponding spreadsheet page in the AEM authoring repository.
In this example, all pages stored under /content/aem-boilerplate/... will be publicly accessible on the Edge Delivery Services site directly under https://main--my-site--org.aem.live/.....
TIP: All tabular data managed as spreadsheets (e.g. metadata, redirects, and taxonomy) are typically published as .json API URLs on Edge Delivery Services. To do so, they must be individually listed in the mapping configuration. Please see the document Using Spreadsheets to Manage Tabular Data for more information.
Examples
../path/:/ maps a folder (both ending in /).
../path:/anotherpath maps a document to a different path (previously known as a vanity URL).
../path/en:/folder/ is a special case and maps the document to /folder/index.
../path/:/en maps a folder to a document and not a typical use case.
All rules are applied and the last that matches is used. I.e. the order of the rules is from least to most significant.
includes
The includes configuration controls which content paths are actually replicated to Edge Delivery Services. It can hold any array of paths as well and typically contains the site’s top-level root page.
Assets used on Edge Delivery Services pages are typically published alongside the webpage. They will be exported from the AEM authoring instance to Edge Delivery Services automatically.
TIP: If you have a use case where you want assets published directly to Edge Delivery Services (for example you would like images or PDFs to be directly accessible by their URLs outside of a page context), you must add the DAM paths to the includes section of the configuration as well. For example, if an asset root folder such as /content/dam/my-site/documents containing a set of PDF should be publicly accessible via /assets/..., an entry must be added to the includes section of the configuration.
How to configure
Your path mappings can be configured in one of two ways depending on the setup of your project.
If the project is configured for aem.live and uses the configuration service for centralized configurations, the paths mapping for each site is configured via this configuration service.
Here is an example cURL request to configure path mappings.
Here is an example cURL request to configure path mappings.
If the project does not use the configuration service, the paths mapping is configured via a paths.json file in your project’s GitHub repository.
See https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xwalk/blob/main/paths.json for an example.
See https://github.com/adobe-rnd/aem-boilerplate-xwalk/blob/main/paths.json for an example.
In both cases, once you configure your path mappings, you can check the configuration via the publicly-accessible configuration URL https://<branch>--<site>--<org>.aem.page/config.json.

The Anatomy of a Project
This document describes what a typical project should look like from a code standpoint. Before reading this document, please familiarize yourself with the document Getting Started - Developer Tutorial.
Git and GitHub
One of our defining philosophies is that it is easiest to allow users to work with the tools that they are familiar with. The overwhelming majority of developers manage their code in systems based on Git, so it only makes sense to allow developers to work with Git to manage and deploy their code.
We are using a buildless approach that runs directly from your GitHub repo. After installing the AEM GitHub bot on your repo, websites are automatically created for each of your branches for content preview on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/ and the production site on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live/ for published content.
Every resource that you put into your GitHub repo is available on your website, so a file in your GitHub repo on the main branch in /scripts/scripts.js will be available on https://main--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/scripts/scripts.jsThis should be very intuitive. There are few “special” files that Adobe Experience Manager uses to connect the content into your website.
We strongly recommend that repos are kept public on GitHub, to foster the community. For a public facing website there really is no need to keep the code hidden, as it is being served to the browsers of your website.
Important notes:
The combination <branch>--<repo>--<owner> must not exceed 63 characters (including the hyphens/dashes). This is a subdomain name constraint.
branch, repo and owner cannot contain --.
Configuration Files
There are some files in your GitHub repo that have a special meaning to AEM and are processed in a special fashion. These files are in the root directory of your repo.
The Content Connection: fstab.yaml
As you may have seen in the getting started guide the fstab.yaml file serves as the connection to your Google Drive or SharePoint folders that contain your content. This file is used as an indicator for how the code in your GitHub repo gets combined with the content in your content source.
Beyond providing the connection to the content, the fstab.yaml also provides a folder mapping facility that allows you map extensionless “routes” to a given piece of content or static HTML.
The Entry Point: head.html
The head.html file is the most important extension point to influence the markup of the content. The easiest way to think of it is that this file is injected on the server side as part of the <head> HTML tag and is combined with the metadata coming from the content.
The head.html should remain largely unchanged from the boilerplate and there are only very few legitimate reasons in a regular project to make changes. Those include remapping your project to a different base URL for the purposes of exposing your project in a different folder than the root folder of your domain on your CDN or to support legacy browsers which usually require scripts that are not loaded as modules.
Adding marketing technology like Adobe Web SDK, Google Tag Manager or other 3rd party scripts to your head.html file is strongly advised against due to performance impacts. Adding inline scripts or styles to head.html is also not advisable for performance and code management reasons, see the section Scripts and Styles below for more information about handling scripts and styles.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/helix-project-boilerplate/blob/main/head.html
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/head.html
https://github.com/adobe/business-website/blob/main/head.html
Not Found: 404.html
To create a custom 404 response, place a 404.html file into the root of your github repository. This will be served on any URL that doesn’t map to an existing resource in either content or code, and replaces the body of the out of the box minimalist 404 response.
The 404 can mimic the markup of an existing page including your code for the site, with navigation footers etc., or it can have a completely different appearance.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/hlxsites/bamboohr-website/blob/main/404.html See in Action
https://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/404.html See in Action
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/404.html See in Action
Don’t Serve: .hlxignore
There are some files in your repo that should not be served from your website, either because you would like to keep them private or they are not relevant to the delivery of the website (e.g. tests, build tools, build artifacts, etc.) and don’t need to be observed by the AEM bot. You can add those to a .hlxignore file in the same format as the well-known .gitignore file.
Please see the following example.
https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/.hlxignore
Tame the Bots: robots.txt
A robots.txt file is generally a regular file that is served as you would expect on your production website on your own domain. To protect your preview and origin site from being indexed, your .page and .live sites will serve a robots.txt file that disallows all robots instead of the robots.txt file from your repo.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/robots.txt
https://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/robots.txt
https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/robots.txt
Query and Indexing: helix-query.yaml
There is a flexible indexing facility that lets you keep track of all of your content pages conveniently as a spreadsheet. This facility is often used to show lists or feeds of pages as well as to filter and sort content on a website. Please see the document Indexing for more information.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/helix-query.yaml
Automate Your Sitemap: helix-sitemap.yaml
Complex sitemaps can automatically be created for you whenever authors publish new content, including flexible hreflang mappings where needed. This functionality is usually based on the indexing facility.See this GitHub issue for sitemap configuration options.
Please see the following examples.
https://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/fedpub/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yaml
Commonly Used File and Folder Structure
Beyond the files treats as special or configuration files, there is a commonly-used structure that is expressed in the Boilerplate repo.
The common folders below are usually in the root directory of a project repo, but in cases where only a portion of a website is handled by AEM, they are often moved to a subfolder to reflect the mapping of the route of the origin in a CDN.
This means that in a case where for example only /en/blog/ is initially mapped to AEM from the CDN, all the folder structures below (eg. /scripts, /styles, /blocks etc.) are moved into a the /en/blog/ folder in GitHub to keep the CDN mapping as simple as possible.
With a simple adjustment of the reference to scripts.js and styles.css in head.html (see above) it is possible to indicate that all the necessary files are loaded from the respective code base directory. To avoid url rewriting the folder structure is also created the content source (eg. sharepoint or google drive) by having a directory structure of /en/blog/.In many cases as the AEM footprint grows on a site there is a point in time when the code gets moved back to the root folder and the head.html references are adjusted accordingly.
Scripts and Styles
By convention in a AEM project, the head.html references styles.css, scripts.js, and aem.js located in /scripts and /styles, as the entry points for the project code.
scripts.js is where your global custom javascript code lives and is where the block loading code is triggered. styles.css hosts the global styling information for your site, and minimally contains the global layout information that is needed to display the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).As all three files are loaded before the page can be displayed, it is important that they are kept relatively small and executed efficiently.Beyond styles.css, a lazy-styles.css file is commonly used, which is loaded after the LCP event, and therefore can contain slower/more CSS information. This could be a good place for fonts or global CSS that is below the fold.
In addition to scripts.js, there is the commonly-used delayed.js. This is a catch-all for libraries that need to be loaded on a page but should be kept from interfering with the delivery of the page. This is a good place for code that is outside of the control of your project and usually includes the martech stack and other libraries.
Please see the document Keeping it 100, Web Performance for more information about optimizing your site performance.
Blocks
Most of the project-specific CSS and JavaScript code lives in blocks. Authors create blocks in their documents. Developers then write the corresponding code that styles the blocks with CSS and/or decorates the DOM to take the markup of a block and transform it to the structure that’s needed or convenient for desired styling and functionality.
The block name is used as both the folder name of a block as well as the filename for the .css and .js files that are loaded by the block loader when a block is used on a page.
The block name is also used as the CSS class name on the block to allow for intuitive styling. The javascript is loaded as a module (ESM) and exports a default function that is executed as part of the block loading.
A simple example is the Columns Block. It adds additional classes in JavaScript based on how many columns are in the respective instance created by the author. This allows it to be able to use flexible styling of content that is in two columns vs. three columns.
Icons
Most projects have SVG files that are usually added to the /icons folder, and can be referenced with a :<iconname>: notation by authors. By default, icons are inlined into the DOM so they can be styled with CSS, without having to create SVG symbols.

https://www.aem.live/docs/authoring-taxonomy

Managing taxonomy data with AEM authoring as your content source
Tagging is an important feature that helps you organize and manage your pages. The Tagging Console in AEM allows you to create a rich taxonomy of tags to organize your pages.
These tags are useful not only for you and your authors in organizing your content, but can also be for your readers as well. Tags and their taxonomy can be used in components on the page to help your readers navigate your content.
The Universal Editor works only with the IDs of your tags. By creating a taxonomy page for your content, you expose the descriptions of these tags in all languages to the Universal Editor so it can use that information when rendering content.
TIP: Please see the document Model Definitions, Fields, and Component Types for more information about the AEM Tag field available to the Universal Editor, which can work with your taxonomy.
Creating a taxonomy page
A taxonomy is created like any other page in AEM.
Navigate to the Sites console.
Select the location where you wish to create your taxonomy.
Tap or click Create → Page.
On the Template tab of the Create Page wizard, select the Taxonomy template and tap or click Next.
On the Properties tab of the Create Page wizard, provide a meaningful Title for the page and in the Tags field, use the tag picker to select the tag(s) or namespace(s) you wish to include in your taxonomy.
Tap or click Create.
The taxonomy page is created. In the Success dialog, you can tap or click Done dialog to dismiss the message or Open to edit the page in the Page Editor.
Take note of the resulting page name of the taxonomy page for use in the following steps.
Editing a taxonomy page
You start editing a taxonomy page like any other page in AEM.
Navigate to the Sites console.
Select the taxonomy you wish to edit.
Tap or click Edit in the action bar.
The Page Editor opens, showing the taxonomy.
The taxonomy page is read-only in the Page Editor.
The taxonomy page is read-only in the Page Editor.
Tap or click the Page Information icon in the toolbar and select Open Properties.
In the Page Properties window, you can update the name of the page and use the tag selector to update the tag(s) and namespace(s) included in your taxonomy.
Tap or click Save & Close.
The page displayed in the Page Editor is read-only because the content of the taxonomy is generated automatically from the selected tag(s) and namespace(s). They act as a kind of filter for automatically generating the content of the taxonomy. Therefore there is no reason to directly edit the page in the editor.
AEM automatically updates the content of the taxonomy page when you update the underlying tag(s) and namespace(s). However you must republish the taxonomy after any change in order to make those changes available to your users.
Update paths.json for taxonomy publication
Like when managing and publishing tabular data for your Edge Delivery Services site, you need to update your paths.json file of your project to allow publication of your taxonomy data.
Open the root of your project in GitHub.
Tap or click the paths.json file to open its details and then the Edit icon.
Add a line to map your new taxonomy page to a .json resource.
<taxonomy-page-name> must match the name of the taxonomy page you created.
<taxonomy-json-name> can be any valid name you choose.
<taxonomy-page-name> must match the name of the taxonomy page you created.
<taxonomy-json-name> can be any valid name you choose.
Click Commit changes… to save the changes to main.
Either commit to main or create a pull request as per your process.
Either commit to main or create a pull request as per your process.
This process only needs to be done once per taxonomy page. Once done, you can publish your taxonomy.
TIP: For more information about path mappings, please see the document Path Mapping for Edge Delivery Services.
Publishing a taxonomy
A taxonomy is not available to the Universal Editor or your users until it is published.
Taxonomy pages are published like any other page by using the Quick Publish or Manage Publication icons in the toolbar.
You must republish your taxonomy page every time you:
Edit the taxonomy page.
Edit or add to the tag(s) and namespace(s) included in your taxonomy page.
If you create a new taxonomy page you must first add a mapping to it to the paths.json file in your project.
Accessing taxonomy information
Once your taxonomy is published, its information can be leveraged by the Universal Editor and made visible to your users. You can access the taxonomy as JSON data at the following address.
https://<branch>--<repository>--<owner>.aem.page/<taxonomy-json-name>.json
Use the <taxonomy-json-name> that you defined when mapping your taxonomy to the paths.json file in your project. The taxonomy data is returned as JSON data like in the following example.
This JSON data will automatically update as you update the taxonomy and republish it. Your app can programmatically access this information for your users.
If you maintain tags in multiple languages, you can access those languages by passing in the ISO2 language code as the value of a sheet= parameter.
Exposing additional tag properties
By default, your taxonomy will contain tag and title values as seen in the previous example. You can configure your taxonomy to expose additional tag properties. In this example we will expose the tag description.
Use the Sites console to select the taxonomy you created.
Tap or click the Properties icon in the toolbar.
In the Additional Properties section, tap or click Add to add a field.
In the new field enter the JRC property name to expose. In this case, enter jcr:description for the tag description.
Tap or click Save & Clos e.
With the taxonomy still selected, tap or click Quick Publish in the toolbar.
Now when you access your taxonomy, the tag description (or whatever property you chose to expose) is included in the JSON.

Getting Started – Document Authoring (DA) Developer Tutorial
This tutorial will get you up-and-running with a new Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) project. In ten to twenty minutes, you will have created your own site and be able to create, preview, and publish your own content, styling, and add new blocks.
Prerequisites:
You have a GitHub account, and understand Git basics.
You understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You have node / npm installed for local development.
This tutorial uses macOS, Chrome, and Visual Studio Code as the development environment and the screenshots and instructions reflect that setup. You can use a different operating system, browser, and code editor, but the UI you see and steps you must take may vary accordingly.
What makes Document Authoring different
Document Authoring (DA) is an alternative to SharePoint or Google Drive that provides a document-based authoring interface focused on the AEM Document model (Blocks, Sections, etc.). It provides an SDK, APIs, and built-in Adobe technologies.
Getting started
The fastest and easiest way to get started following AEM best practices is to create your repository using the AEM Block Collection GitHub repository as a template. You can find it here: https://github.com/aemsites/da-block-collection
Click the Use this template button and select Create a new repository, and select the user or org you would like to own this repository.
We recommend that the repository is set to public.
The only remaining step in GitHub is to install the AEM Code Sync GitHub App on your repository by visiting this link: https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync/installations/new. This app will sync code changes to AEM.
In the Repository access settings of the AEM Code Sync App, make sure you select Only select Repositories (not All Repositories). Then select your newly created repository, and click Save.
Note: If you are using Github Enterprise with IP filtering, you can add the following IP to the allow list: 3.227.118.73
Congratulations! You have a new website running on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/ In the example above that’s https://main--da-tutorial--da-sites.aem.page/
Link your code and content
Copy your GitHub repo URL. In our example, this would be: https://github.com/da-sites/da-tutorial
Paste this URL into the https://da.live/start page and click Go.
You will be presented with a code snippet to place in your project. Click Copy to add the code to your clipboard. You will then be walked through the process of adding the snippet to your fstab.yaml.
Note: Firefox users may have to select the snippet and copy manually.
Clicking Copy will present an Open button. This button will take you directly to your fstab.yaml to paste your snippet.
Upon landing back in GitHub, paste the code snippet and commit the changes. You can close the GitHub tab when you are finished committing your changes.
After you have committed your changes, switch back to your https://da.live/start tab and click Done.
You will be presented with the option to create demo content. This is recommended for this tutorial.
Browse your content
After your demo content has been copied, you will be taken to DA’s browse view. Here you can:
Browse your content
Search & replace content
Copy, rename, move, and delete content
Create new docs, sheets, and media
Access configurations for both DA and AEM.
Drag and drop supported files from your computer or mobile device.
Check out the demo page by clicking on it.
Edit and preview your content
One of the unique features of DA is the ability to get a live preview of your document. Click the preview tab to expand the live preview pane.
Once the live preview pane is open, change the document. Below, we have changed the congrats text. You will see your changes reflected in the preview pane on the right.
Preview your content from DA
In addition to the AEM Sidekick, DA provides the ability to preview and publish your content. Select the paper airplane in the top right of the page and click preview.
Your page will open in a new tab with your changes. You are now looking at a staged, or preview, version of your page.
Publish your content using AEM Sidekick
The next step is to publish the page using AEM Sidekick. If you have not already done so, install the AEM Sidekick Chrome extension.
After adding the extension to Chrome, don’t forget to pin it, this will make it easier to find it.
Navigate back to your previewed page and toggle the Sidekick extension to see Sidekick at the bottom of your page. Click the Publish button to push your page live.
Start developing styling and functionality
To get started with development, it is easiest to install the AEM Command Line Interface (CLI) and clone your repo locally through using the following.
From there change into your project folder and start your local development environment using the following.
This opens http://localhost:3000/ and you are ready to make changes.A good place to start is in the blocks folder which is where most of the styling and code lives for a project. Simply make a change in a .css or .js and you should see the changes in your browser immediately.
Once you are are ready to push your changes, simply use Git to add, commit, and push and your code to your preview (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/) and production (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live/) sites.
That’s it, you made it! Congrats, your first site is up and running. If you need help in the tutorial, please join our Discord channel or get in touch with us.

Font Fallback and CLS
…in the context of Core Web Vitals
Loading a custom font (a font which is not known by default by all browsers) can easily introduce some delays in the loading sequence and a CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) problem. This is true for the first page load on your site, until the font is cached by the browser.
You can try to preload and/or push the custom font, but there will always be a time where the browser will render the body with a default font. This is especially true on slow devices or on a slow connection. You can hide the full body until the font is loaded, but then the FCP (First Contentful Paint) and LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) scores will be highly penalized.
You can also use CSS tricks like font-display: optional, but the font might not be loaded at all on a slow connection: the browser has the instruction to ignore it after a certain (short) delay.
This last solution does not prevent the CLS score to be impacted: when swapping the font, the size of the content might change, and layout might “shift”.
There is another mechanism that can be used to prevent those 2 issues (font loading delay and CLS): use a font fallback.
The idea of the font fallback is to scale a browser default font so that when applied to the content of a page, the content takes up the same "space" with the font fallback and with the custom font. Like this, you can swap one with the other without a layout shift. If you use a default font that looks “similar” enough to the custom font, those few milliseconds of first-time page load will look really close to the experience you want to provide with the custom font. You can then defer the custom font loading or at least make it non-blocking in the loading sequence.
The font-fallback extension
We have built a chrome extension to help compute the font fallback.
When you open the extension on a page, it analyzes the font faces in use on that page: a font face is a combination of font family and font weight. Now for each of those font faces, you can select a default browser font and run the font fallback computation. For each font face, the extension computes which size-adjustment of the default browser font is required so that the content has the same width with both fonts.The computation happens only on the width because the height should be controlled by the line-height: you should set a line-height on your site to not let the font decide what the height of the text is. This is true for paragraphs, headings, lists…Note: with font kits, there is a tendency to load many font faces that are never used (or used somewhere else on the site than on the current page). The extension shows also how many are loaded in total. It is also a good indicator if some optimization can be done: optimize the font kit by reducing the font faces it delivers, you can save a lot of bytes to transfer!
Once the computation work is done, you can copy the computed CSS and paste it in your main CSS.
The generated font families must be added after the custom font in your CSS font-family: the browser will initially not find the custom font, use the fallback until, later, the custom font is loaded. Since they use the same space, the swap does not generate CLS!
To fine tune the font adjust value, you can also use the simulation panel.
Checking the box replaces the custom font by the computed fallback font directly in the page. The text input allows you to change the size-adjust value and immediately visualize the result (you need to toggle the checkbox each time you change the value).
Edge cases
The extension makes a calculation based on an existing site, with existing content and CSS rules. In a different context, the size-adjust may not fit perfectly and the font swap may still produce CLS:
Content dependency: the text iiiii has a smaller width than mmmmm for the same number of characters. The number of m in the text has a bigger influence on the width. But you can find a size-adjust that matches the average text by running the extension on multiple pages and taking an average of the size-adjust.
Small container: if your text is in a small container (especially true on mobile) with a restricted width and height, the space allowed to the text is then limited and the computation of the fallback might need to be more precise, i.e. made on this exact text.

Headings
Notes:
Semantic headings are the backbone of any document structure. In documents you should always follow the semantic hierarchy of your document, meaning that a Heading 1 should contain a Heading 2 which in turn should contain a Heading 3 and so forth.In cases where you find yourself using the headings out of sequence or leaving gaps in the heading hierarchy, that’s usually an indication that you are either trying to use headings to adjust to visual or design constraints or you are using headings for something that is semantically not a heading. Either of those can lead to bad results.
According to Web best practices there should only be a single Heading 1 per page, which will also be used as the default title for the document.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
The Content Structure leverages the built-in Heading 1 - Heading 6 mapped to h1 through h6.
See Content in Document
Code:
As headings are default content they are styled in project or block CSS code. There is usually no JavaScript code used.
There is no code related to list generic styling in Boilerplate.

http://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection/text

Text
Notes:
A Text Paragraph (or Copy) is the most common element on websites. AEM understands and translates a number of semantic formatting like bold, italic, underline, strike-through as well as subscript and superscript, which are translated to their respective semantic HTML tags of <strong>, <em>, <u>, <s>, <sup> and <sub>.
CSS styling may take hints from these formatting options and use them to express visually very different styling. Both a paragraph and line-feed are supported.
The first portion of the first text paragraph serves as the default description for the a page if nothing else is specified in metadata.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
The content structure is based on the simple Normal Text paragraphs in word or google doc.
See Content in Document
Code:
As text is Default Content it is styled in project or block CSS code. There is usually no JavaScript code used.This code is included in boilerplate, there is no need to copy it.https://github.com/adobe/helix-project-boilerplate/blob/27e8571592220da8ded7c8a7e5064d982f7cfe76/styles/styles.css#L45-L51

http://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection/images

Images
Notes:
Pictures, Illustrations and Images are an integral part of making a web experience both more informative and also more engaging. Simply add images to your documents either by inserting them or just copy/paste images from your source.
Add Alt-texts to your images to make your content more accessible. Both Word and Google Docs have great support for that.
AEM automatically takes care of resizing the images to the appropriate size for the website and converting them into the formats that make sense for the consuming browser.
We recommend inserting your images with at least a width of 2000 pixels if available, so even at a large display resolution the images will still be crisp.
The first image on a page will automatically become the image that is used in metadata (for social media and messaging applications) unless defined otherwise in metadata.
Special Mention for GDocs: Google downsizes the images to a maximum of 1600 pixels width or 1600 height. This is still sufficient for most use cases of photography images, but for some illustrations it can lead to visible artifacts.

Lists
Notes:
Lists serve many purposes in the Web in general, some uses or obvious lists inside default content, while others are used in navigations or other hierarchical constructs.
Extraction of nested numbered lists and bullet lists is supported. Lists are converted to the <ol> and <ul> HTML tags respectively.
Complex list items seem to be hard to manage in word processing without accidentally being broken up so it is generally recommended to keep lists relatively simple when it comes to the complexity of the items in the list.

Links
Notes:
Hyperlinks are essential to connect websites and your content. To create a link, just use the insert link option in word or google doc.
Links can be added across all the default content and the different formatting options.
In Word and Google Docs only absolute links are accepted, which is usually easier to copy paste from your browser. Links are automatically converted to be relative to your site, while external links are kept absolute.
Links are often used beyond text links and reference for example embedded media or referenced fragments that are inlined in the page.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
See Content in Document
Code:
As links are considered Default Content they are styled in project or block CSS code. There is usually no JavaScript code used.There is no link related styling code in the boilerplate project.
Special Mention: Microsoft Word Online does not allow links on images, so a workaround would be to let authors put a link directly below the image and then wrap it on the client side, e.g.
Special Mention: It is recommended to handle certain links that need to be opened in a new window based on whether they are external links or PDFs (for example) on the client side, e.g.

Buttons
Notes:
Websites very often contain buttons, as call to actions or more generically. By default in the Boilerplate project buttons are created as a link in a paragraph by itself.
Bold and Italic (<strong> and <em>) and possibly combinations thereof are used to specify certain types of buttons. There are often primary and secondary buttons and the default styling is usually defined for default content and/or specified by a containing block, and Bold and Italic can be used to specify alternative variations of buttons.
Example:

Code:
As Buttons are considered Default Content they are styled in project or block CSS code.
There is Javascript code for decoration purposes that is included in the default boilerplate behavior and it usually remains unchanged.Decoration CodeThe CSS Styling is very project specific and gets adjusted as needed for a project or block by block.

Code
Notes:
Most technical documentation websites (including this one) have the need to display code. Most marketing websites don’t have that requirement, but since there is an intuitive and simple styling and markup the notion of code elements both inline and preformatted multiline is supported out of the box.
Formatting something in word or gdoc as a fixed font (eg. Courier New) will automatically output a <code> element or a <code> and <pre> block for multiline.

Sections
Notes:
Sections are the top level grouping mechanism in documents, think of them as containers for a set of default content and blocks. Learn more about the Document Structure here.
Sections are separated by “Horizontal Rules” or --- to group certain elements of a page together. There may be both semantic and design reasons to group content together, a simple case could be that a section of a page has a different background color.
Technically a section just introduces a <div> wrapper in the markup delivered around all the blocks and default content contained in the section.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
See Content in Document
Code:
In most cases generic sections don’t have much styling code beyond project specific box layout (eg. margins, padding, max-width) and are sometimes augmented with section metadata to control styling (often background colors or images).

http://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection/icons

Icons
Notes:
Most if not all websites have icons, therefore there is a simple way to reference icons for authors.
Icons are referenced as :<iconname>: notation. As there are different ways to implement icons in the browser either as plain css classes, icon fonts or SVG, we offer a non-intrusive way to support all of those.
The boilerplate project includes an automatic mechanism to insert SVGs into the icon `<span>`s as that’s the most common way to deal with icons.
While some icons need to be in the code (icons referenced in blocks for example), there are times when authors need to add and reference new icons and update them on an ongoing basis. These icons can and should live with the content under an /icons/ folder in the content source (eg. Sharepoint or Google Drive). These icons can also be referenced the exact same way using the :<iconname>: notation. This will allow marketers to add and update icons they need for content without any dependency on a code change.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
The :<iconname>: can be inserted as a part of all Default Content constructs.
See Content in Document
Code:
Icons are Default Content and are styled in project specific CSS code. If there is any JavaScript that is required to load the SVGs it can be adapted as needed.This code is included in Boilerplate, there is no need to copy it.

Architecture
Edge Delivery Services and document-based authoring are part of the next generation of Adobe Experience Manager’s composable architecture. A key aspect of this architecture is to enable customers to create great experiences using the infrastructure and processes that already enable their success.
How AEM fits in
At the highest level, Adobe Experience Manager is an on origin service that you plug in to your existing Content Delivery Network (CDN). There are out of the box integrations with Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly, and Amazon Cloudfront.
The AEM stack itself is engineered for high performance and availability. In order to achieve best possible availability, all delivery services are run in two fully redundant edge providers, have fully redundant storage infrastructure, and are constantly monitored for performance.
The full picture
Looking at the full stack, there are four key layers:
Your customer-specific infrastructure like CDNs, DNS, TLS certificates, etc.
Adobe’s edge compute layer
Adobe’s storage layer for edge delivery
Your customer-specific sources of content and code
In the visitor-facing tier of this architecture, Edge Delivery Services, customers use their existing CDNs, DNS, certificates, etc. which is then delivering the AEM-produced experience to all modern web browsers, native mobile applications, chat bots, or other backend applications.
The central tier consists of the experience composition service, a dual-stack (for maximum availability) architecture that serves content stored in highly optimized formats for experience delivery. The storage layer is made up of Content Bus for structured and unstructured content, Media Bus for assets and media, and Code Bus for the code of the site.
The bottom tier enables authoring productivity and just like the top tier, it composes the tools and infrastructure already in use, be it AEM Authoring, Microsoft Sharepoint, Word, Excel, or Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets.
How content gets published
The core publishing process is facilitated by the Admin service for preview and publishing and consists of two key steps, both triggered by authors through the sidekick.
The preview operation in sidekick will pull content from the configured content source such as Sharepoint or Google Drive, or Adobe Experience Manager Sites. This integration is based on the standardized delivery format for structured and unstructured content and can be extended to other third-party content providers. Once the content has been pulled from the originating repository, it will be stored in AEM’s storage layer, separated by structured, unstructured content, assets, and media.
In a second step, authors can publish content. This operation takes the previewed content and makes it available to the delivery tier of our infrastructure. The most important step here is to purge the CDN. AEM will purge every layer of the caching infrastructure, thanks to its deep integration with content delivery networks.
What about code?
Like content, AEM uses code from your customer-provided repositories. Unlike content, code is taken from GitHub, using the AEM code sync app for GitHub that has been installed during the initial tutorial.
This integration pulls code from all active branches, enabling effective parallel development and scalable testing. When code is merged into the main branch, the CDN will be purged of all affected resources, making deployments fast and easy.
Lifecycle differences of Content, Media, Code and Configuration.
Internally AEM separates different resources needed to assemble and deliver a website based on their corresponding lifecycle and manages them separately.Content (text in documents and spreadsheets, PDFs, SVGs, redirects, etc.) follow lifecycle states of preview and publish have stages of preview and publish. Content is immediately available to all Code branches on the corresponding .aem.page and .aem.live URLs depending on their previewed / published state.
Media (images, and videos uploaded or copy/pasted into a document) is using Content Addressable Storage internally, meaning that every asset is only stored once with a unique hash following the media_ prefix. Media is accessible on all branch URLs across .aem.page and .aem.live as soon as it is added to the system via a preview operation of the asset itself or a document that contains the asset. Since the hash is produced from the binary content of the asset itself, it is immutable and can be cached permanently.
Code (javascript, css, etc. ) is managed in branches, creating individual environments for every branch. Changes are visible across .aem.page and .aem.live URLs at the same time.
Configuration (via config service) is using inheritance from a profile and is immediately applied to all branch environments on both .aem.page and .aem.live for a particular site.

Staging & Environments
Separating environments for testing and production is an important practice to ensure high availability of your site, which is why AEM provides each developer with a way to test work on their branch that is separate from the production environment on the main branch.
Many organizations also require in their guidelines the creation of a dedicated staging environment. In this guide we discuss the role of staging environments and best practices for implementing them.
You probably don’t need a staging environment
Each repository running on *.aem.live has as many testing environments as there are branches. As long as you enable the GitHub branch protection rules require a pull request before merging, require status checks to pass before merging, and require branches to be up to date before merging, each of your feature branches will be up to date with the main branch before it can be merged and will accurately reflect the nature of your published site.
The practice of setting up a staging environment emerged at a time when computing resources were scarce, and an entire development team had to share a single environment to test their changes. This could lead to adverse effects, for instance a breaking bug in one branch could block all other development from progressing.
With dedicated branches for each feature and fix, and a virtually unlimited number of preview environments for these branches, this is no longer an issue and the workaround of a dedicated staging environment is no longer needed.
aem.page is not a staging environment
In content management, discussions of staging environments are complicated by the fact that authors want to preview their content before being published and developers want to preview their code changes before being merged. With the separation of *.aem.page for content previews and *.aem.live for published content, we provide this ability to authors.
In order to make previewing content as fast as possible, *.aem.page uses different caching rules from *.aem.live, with one being optimized for immediacy, the other for high cacheability.
This means that *.aem.page and *.aem.live behave differently, and consequently *.aem.page should not be used as a staging environment for code. It is a preview environment for content.
You can preview code in all places
As you sometimes need to preview code that refers to content that has not yet been published, the *.aem.page environment supports the same branch-based creation of testing environments.
When you should set up a staging environment
For the vast majority of customers, rule 1: “you probably don’t need a staging environment” applies. In case you are applying complex configurations, rewrite rules, or even custom edge code in your content delivery network (CDN), it is highly advisable to set up a staging environment for the CDN.
The following tips apply:
Use a hostname that follows the pattern of your main website. If your main site is on www.example.com then use stage.example.com as the hostname
Use your main branch on *.aem.live as the origin – your intent is to test the CDN, not AEM-specific code which has been tested on the *.aem.live testing environment. You want to work with real content and accurate caching rules, so use *.aem.live as the origin
Flush caches deliberately. Through the built-in CDN integration, publishing content to *.aem.live and merging code into the main branch will surgically purge the cache to your production CDN. You should ensure that your staging CDN will be purged when appropriate
Setting up a staging CDN is something that is only advised to a small subset of customers. An even smaller subset will have the need to test the interaction between client-side code and CDN configuration.
Following the guideline that there should be as many staging “environments” as there are active branches, it is recommended to set up a staging CDN that mirrors the *.aem.live URL structure, so that ref.examplestage.com will point to ref–-site--example.aem.live., allowing each developer to access a dedicated testing environment that combines client-side code and CDN-side configuration in one accessible place.
Following the reasoning above, creating a separate staging branch and mapping this to a separate CDN site is not advisable.

Security Overview
This security guide covers Edge Delivery Services in Adobe Experience Manager Sites as a Cloud Service, the Admin API for Edge Delivery Services, the Sharepoint integration, and the developer tooling for Edge Delivery Services. There is a separate security guide for the AEM Sidekick. Familiarity with the overall architecture is recommended and assumed for the rest of this guide.
Overall Considerations
Tenant Isolation
All services that are a part of aem.live are multi-tenant. Tenant isolation is built into the publish and delivery services as well as the Content Hub to help ensure required content and data protection.
Write operations (preview or publish) require project details (GitHub owner, repository, branch and, if configured, an access token) and content paths be included in requests. This is required to inform the Admin Service which source document to fetch and where to store the processed content in the Content Hub. Similarly, a content request coming from a customer’s CDN must include the project details and path in its URL structure so the delivery service knows which content to deliver.
Data Encryption
All data in transit is exchanged over secure, encrypted connections using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or greater. All data at rest is encrypted using AES256, with keys managed by two (2) independent cloud service providers.
Product Code
Adobe uses scaled trunk-based development for continuous deployment of AEM Sites as a Cloud Service. We push incremental changes to aem.live as soon as they pass our rigorous reviews and automated testing.
Preview and Delivery
Request Filtering
aem.live applies strict path filtering on the edge for any content it delivers to help reduce potential attack surface. This path filtering is functionally equivalent to a web application firewall (WAF) and prevents thousands of attacks every minute.
Other than generic web application firewalls that are based on deny-lists of known security exploits, AEM uses a strict list of permissible patterns to only permit legitimate traffic.
The deep integration of the edge layer and the underlying services that make up delivery and preview ensures maximum security and high performance without the overhead of a dedicated web application firewall.
Rate and Volume Limiting
All requests and usage of the preview and publish services are subject to rate and volume limits that are applied on a project-by-project basis and continuously monitored. This prevents denial-of-service attacks (DoS), in the form of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and self-inflicted Denial of Service attacks through misconfigured monitoring, bots, and crawlers. The vast majority of attacks prevented fall into the latter category..
Secure Network Routing
Edge Delivery services enforces TLS and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to help ensure that every request is effectively secured.
Site Authentication
Site authentication, once enabled, ensures that only authorized requests can be made to the preview and publish tiers of an AEM site. Requests are required to present one of a list of configured site tokens to be permitted. Users can issue and revoke tokens through the Admin API.
Authors can use the AEM Sidekick to access protected sites using transient site tokens.
Disaster Recovery
The Content Hub is where all published content, media, and code is stored. For this tier, we rely on active/active replication in a multi-cloud setup. Unlike traditional approaches to disaster recovery where like active/standby or multi-region deployments, an active/active multi-cloud setup ensures that any content, media, or code that gets previewed or published is stored redundantly in at least two different cloud providers with different, but functionally identical software stacks.
In case of an outage, even a global outage of a cloud provider's control plane that would affect a multi-region setup, all content is still available in the second cloud provider and operations can resume without data loss.
The active/active deployment means that during normal operations, the workloads are split roughly equally between our cloud providers and only in an outage of one the remaining providers will pick up the load.
The delivery service itself is also deployed redundantly, so in case of an outage at one cloud provider, Adobe can plan to switch to the other and resume delivery instantaneously, if possible. The intended recovery time objective (RTO) for this service is 15 minutes.
Admin API
Authentication
The Admin API strictly requires authentication for all administrative operations and can be set up to require authentication for content operations like previewing or publishing through the sidekick. This requirement extends to the use of the AEM Sidekick.
Authentication is delegated to the identity provider (IdP) that backs the content source of the site, such as Microsoft or Google authentication.
Roles and Permissions
Authors can be assigned different roles based on the tasks they need to perform. The mapping is done in the project configuration. The following roles are built-in:
admin.role.author: This role allows a user to update content in the Preview environment
admin.role.publish: This role allows a user to update content in the Preview and Live environments
Disaster Recovery
The Admin API is currently a single-cloud deployment. In case of an outage in this service, the intended RTO is 12 hours. Adobe regularly conducts disaster recovery tests to validate that both delivery and API services can be restored well within their respective intended RTOs.
Rate and Volume Limiting
All requests and usage of the Admin API are subject to rate and volume limits that ensure smooth operation of the service. In addition to the published limits, Adobe can apply secondary limits on a case-by-case basis.
Backend Integrations
Sharepoint
Please see Sharepoint integration (application) or Sharepoint integration (delegated), depending on your setup.
GitHub
The AEM Code Sync GitHub application uses GitHub permissions to provide access to your GitHub repository, so that code can be made available for serving in the code bus. Following permissions are requested:
read access to metadata – so that code gets assigned to the correct Code Bus space for your repository
read/write access to checks – so that the pull request status can be set when the Pagespeed Insights performance test passes
read/write access to content – so that content can be replicated to the Code Bus. Write access is required to send repositotry_dispatch events and trigger GitHub actions
read/write access to deployments – so that each branch in your GitHub repository can correspond to a deployment on aum.live
read/write access to issues – so that Adobe can raise issues with your code when detected
read/write access to pull requests – so that Adobe can suggest code updates, if required
The Code Sync GitHub app will not perform writes to your repository, but raise PRs, so that your approval will be given for each code change.
Backends with IP Filtering
If your backend only allows connections from a specific list of IPs, add 3.227.118.73 to ensure AEM is able to connect to it.
Author Tooling
AEM Sidekick
The AEM Sidekick is a browser extension installed via Chrome Web Store or Apple App Store and helps authors preview and publish their content. See Sidekick Security for more detailed information.
Developer Tooling
AEM Command Line Application
The AEM Command Line Application is installed via npm and requires access to the developer's file system, so that the site under development can be previewed using code from the developer's working copy.
It also requires network access to *.aem.live and *.aem.page, and validates all requests using Transport Layer Security (TLS) against the node.js certificate store. When man-in-the-middle attacks or tampering with request routing are detected, the command line application refuses to serve a preview site.
Trust, but verify
If you'd like to verify our security claims, as a customer, you are allowed to perform penetration tests against our services, even without advance notice. We ask you to stick to the following rules:
Perform load tests incl. simulated (D)DoS attacks only against production infrastructure, which includes your CDN
If you find a vulnerability, disclose it responsibly to psirt@adobe.com and we'll get back to you

Limits
To ensure functioning within normal parameters and system stability for all customers, we enforce limits across many dimensions. The limits are designed to prevent accidental misuse and are subject to change and often can individually be raised on a per customer basis.
If you find yourself in a situation where you think that the limits are prohibitive for your use case, contact us and let us know.
Document Naming
The URLs generated for document names will only take into account the following characters:
alphabetical, lowercase characters (a-z)
numbers (0-9)
simple dash (-)
All other characters are replaced with a single dash, and the final document name will have leading and trailing dashes removed.
The full file path for a document should not exceed 900 characters.
Supported Delivery File Types
The following file types can be delivered from the Content Bus and Media Bus:
HTML (extension-less only), JSON, MP4, PDF, SVG, JPG and PNG.
Other file types are deliverable via Code Bus, or may need to be delivered through 3rd party systems.
Content Source Limits
The following limits below are applied on preview operations for content that is ingested from Sharepoint or Google Drive. If exceeded most of them produce an error in sidekick for authors.
File Size Limits
Support for uploads of files from the content sources is provided for the following file types with the following limits.
Other file types may be uploaded through code (eg. through GitHub) or depending on the use case created on the client-side (eg. .ics, etc.).
Indexing Limits
An individual index cannot grow beyond 50k pages indexed.
Sitemap Limits
An individual sitemap file cannot grow beyond 50k pages or 50MB
Redirect Limits
The number of redirects per site cannot exceed 100k.
Number of pages per site
An individual site should not grow beyond 1 million pages. It is advisable to split up a large site into smaller ones matching business units or markets. A repoless setup allows you to reuse the same code base for multiple sites.
Rate Limits (number of preview operations per time)
Rate limits are inferred from the underlying content source (eg. Sharepoint and Google Drive). Throttled requests will receive a response with a 503 status code and an x-error HTTP header containing (429) followed by the message from the backend.
AEM Code Sync/GitHub Limits
To keep the project size manageable we limit the number and size of files that we synchronize from your GitHub repository, as well as the number of active branches/refs. If you have more files in your repo use .hlxignore to avoid syncing them..
Rate Limits (number of deploy operations per time)
Rate limits are inferred from GitHub.
BYOM Content Source Limits
The following limits below are applied on preview operations for content that is ingested via a bring your own content source. If exceeded most of them produce an error in sidekick for authors.
* Please note that the overall response time for fetching the html and the images must not exceed 25 seconds.
The admin service observes the following per-site limits when sending requests to the content source:
Admin API Limits
The admin API is rate limited to 10 requests per second, per project for all operations. Throttled requests will receive a response with a 429 status code.
Use the respective bulk APIs for operating on large amounts of resources.

Global Availability
The Edge Delivery Services architecture for Adobe Experience Manager makes use of redundant content delivery networks (CDNs) to ensure high availability with low latency. The cacheable components of your sites are delivered directly from globally-distributed points of presence (POPs).
Your sites, globally available
The two highest priorities in delivering web experiences are availability and performance. For this reason, we use multiple content delivery networks to provide the Adobe Experience Manager service. Multiple CDNs so that, in the rare case of a CDN outage, we can switch the full delivery stack to a separate CDN to provide continued high availability.
Each CDN uses dozens to thousands of different points of presence (POPs): high-performance caching servers located at critical internet junctures in global locations, close to population centers. These POPs cache the content served for your websites and make it available to “nearby” visitors, minimizing the inherent network latency of interactions.
Operational Telemetry is used to maintain awareness of site stability and availability over time.
Your content, globally distributed
In order to ensure this global availability, your cacheable content has to be globally distributed to the same extent that it is published to global visitors. Each of the core storage areas of the AEM content hub (media, content, code) is therefore equally globally-distributed to be within reach of those global visitors.
What about data residency?
The Edge Delivery Services architecture is designed for global publication of information that would normally appear on public sites. Site owners are responsible for ensuring that the information they choose to publish is in compliance with applicable laws or regulations. Likewise, the data we collect for Operational Telemetry is deliberately limited for the sake of privacy and compliance.

China FAQ
Delivering content in China requires following the relevant laws and regulations in China. The FAQ is not intended as legal or regulatory advice of the laws and regulations. We encourage you to seek independent legal advice on your legal and regulatory obligations for your operations in China.
Can I serve visitors in China with Edge Delivery Services?
Edge Delivery Services in Adobe Experience Manager requires a customer-managed Content Delivery Network (BYOCDN) to serve content to visitors in China
Adobe Experience Manager Edge Delivery Services is using two redundant global content delivery networks (CDNs) to deliver experiences across the world. However, certain regions require using a local CDN to serve the content within that region.
To account for this, customers should use customer-managed CDN (BYOCDN) in China to serve visitors from China. CDN operators in China require customers to provide an Internet Content Provider (ICP) license or ICP recordal.
Can content be authored and published from China?
Authoring content from China is possible with limitations and not fully supported by Adobe.
In order to use document-based editing from within China, three things must be accessible to the author:
The document source – note that Google Docs, Sheets, and Drive are not available in China
The API for previewing and publishing content on admin.hlx.page – this API is typically available from within China, but often has increased latency
The preview URLs on aem.page – this host is available most of the time, but disruptions have been observed
How is the developer experience from China?
Edge Delivery Services consume source code from GitHub. Developers collaborating through GitHub from China may experience network latency which is out of Adobe’s control.
Is AEM Hosting available in China?
Edge Delivery Services in Adobe Experience Manager are currently operated outside of China. For customers that require all AEM servers to be hosted in China due to various reasons including, but not limited to, compliance such as Multi-Level Protection Scheme (MLPS), data residency, Baidu SEO, etc. Adobe Managed Services for Adobe Experience Manager are available in China.

Translation and Localization
The Problem
Many websites need to support multiple languages as well as multiple countries, markets or regions.
In the past decades the dominant approach has been to operate in a “region” or “market” first approach.
This results in an information architecture that looks something like this…
… or …
Usually this leads to both a duplication of content for many locales that share the same language and the loss of someone in a particular region / market to read content in the language that they are most comfortable in, for example, for a country like Switzerland only German, French and Italian are supported which leaves a English speaker in Switzerland out of luck.
From the outside: SEO impact and visitor impact
The duplication of content from a public web and SEO perspective is very undesirable as it pollutes public search indexes with redundant information and makes a company lose control of where their audience is sent from the SERP, as search engines will use multiple signals to identify the canonical URLs of a piece of content.
Since users speak, search and think for content in languages for most websites it makes more sense to operate in a language first approach, that lets users interact with the content based on a language not based on a market.
There are certain cases and verticals where there is very little or no overlap of the content that is produced for individual markets in which case of course a market/region based approach is more appropriate. These include industries where branding and regulation is vastly different between countries, but for most international websites that share a lot of the same content across markets it is much more intuitive for the visitor of a website to consume the content by language, and have the ability to consume the content of a website in any language that it is available in, independently of their current geographic location.
On the Inside: The content management problem
In the past a lot of systems have optimized that ability to create and manage a lot of duplicate content. Given the above statement on the problem of duplicate content this clearly seems like the wrong approach. Beyond creating a subpar SEO and site visitor experience this also contributes to an amplified management problem as content is copied around many times, and no matter how good the tools are this leads to potential conflicts and issues that could have been avoided.
Best Practices around Translation and Localization
URL and Content Structure
In AEM we recommend a content and externally visible URL structure that works in two tiers.
The first level focuses on language and the second level focuses on market/region.
Something like:
Using hierarchical fallbacks eg. / contains english content or /en/ automatically contains US content are definitely reasonable and should be based on a company's business focus. So for a company whose business is predominantly in the english speaking US, / should serve up the english speaking website for the US.
This is equally applicable for spreadsheet based resources, as for documents. In some cases it may make sense to override language settings with per market settings. A simple example for that is placeholders, where most of the tokens would live in the language folder and would be overridden from the corresponding market folder.
Language and Market detection
Automatically detecting the language and the market is only a relatively small portion of any multi language and multi market architecture. It cannot be done perfectly and therefore the user should always have the opportunity to self select themselves into a particular market (and language) and keep that decision persisted on their device. There is also legislation that forbids geofencing, which further deemphasizes the importance of automatically trying to detect markets.
Detecting the language is really only relevant if the user in question is a new user who is not following a link from search engine or any other language sensitive context. A user from a search engine will automatically have search content in the language that they would like to get the result in, a user from a paid or social channel will automatically be in the correct language context and will be sent to the corresponding content. As a fall back for language detection the user's browser / operating system language is probably a good bet, but should only be used if there is no other indication.
Detecting a user's market / region is often needed to make sure that the content is localized, but also making sure that commercial offers, currency, legal context with respect to privacy etc. are set up the right way and the website responds correctly. Once the market is detected or selected that’s what will be used for all external services that are market specific as well, for example E-Commerce systems.Usually a good indication is some form of geo IP or the browser Geo Location API. This should be done completely separately from the language of the content that the consumer is interacting with. It is good practice to allow a user to self select themselves with a region switcher into a different market/region and persist that information on the visitors device.
Handling Translation
Since a lot of the content in AEM is based on content that is created in word, google docs and spreadsheets there is a broad range of translation support available. There is built-in support for machine translation in both Microsoft Office and Google Workspace applications but since Office formats are extremely common for all translation services and providers there are existing integrations for bulk translation and translation memories that are readily available.
At scale, in situations where translation processes are standardized with internal, bespoke tooling or APIs for very large organizations with a continuous flow of translation needs, we recommend using Microsoft Office or Google Workspace Automation and APIs to connect those.
Built-in document comparison tooling and intuitive accessible versioning allows for great cherry picking of new content or translations.
Handling Localization
Market specific content should be hosted in the corresponding folder identifying the market, country or region. This is particularly valuable if only a small fraction of the content is localized.
In many cases this includes high traffic pages (eg. landing pages, homepages), local campaign experiments, legal considerations (eg. privacy statements, terms and conditions etc.) as well as settings for a market (eg. currency, etc.).
The goal of this setup is that only content that is actually localized exists for any given market.
Depending on SEO and other needs it may be more advisable to expose the external URLs per locale or decorate the market/region specific content on the same URL, but in many cases it may make sense to expose the market in externally visible URL, something like /en/ca/ for the Canadian homepage.
Link rewriting for localization in practice
As per the above, considering that a we will have a market context / affinity stored on the users device (sessionStorage, localStorage or cookie) we have to process the links that are in content (and code) to make sure that the links that are shown to the user are pointing to the correct content for the market.
A simple starting point usually are header and footer which are very commonly adjusted for on a per market basis, which means that there is a copy of the corresponding documents in the respective market folder and need to automatically be fetched properly by the code that displays the navigation and the footer. Beyond that cross links and CTAs need to be checked for the existence of content in that locale before they are followed.
The technical implementation of that is usually quite straight forward and relies on a AEM index of all the content that has been localized and made available for a particular market and either an eventhandler for click events and/or rewriting of href attributes, as well as some observation for a given market in content fragment or similar fetch requests.
Detailed Example
In an example where a website uses english content written the US market as the default and has some minimal content eg. the homepage (index), localized nav and footer that is localized for the UK market the content structure would something like this (in sharepoint):
This translates to a corresponding URL space of www.mycompany.com/en/ for the US homepage and www.mycompany.com/en/uk/ for the UK homepage. For a visitor from the UK market (detected or self-selected as mentioned above) the localized nav and footer are loaded independently of where they navigate on the site.A UK visitor to www.mycompany.com/en/brands would see the localized navigation and footer with the corresponding links to additional UK content where needed. Beyond that all the inline links in the /en/ content, that point to content that is also available in the /en/uk/ tree (eg. the homepage in this case) would be dynamically rewritten to point to the corresponding localized version.The sitemap with HREFLang support would look something like this:
Live Example
A good example of that implementation is blog.adobe.com.
With the following languages and locales:

Development Collaboration and Good Practices
Working with a large number of development teams across many projects and organizations, we found that it is useful to collect some of our insights. Some of those are related to AEM, but the majority are related to general purpose frontend development or are just general guidelines on how to collaborate in a team of developers.
You may read some of those items and think that it is generally understood as common sense amongst developers. We agree, and that’s a great sign that you are ready to work in a collaborative way on AEM projects together with other developers.
At this point this is just a collection of lessons learned from our engagements on a growing set of projects.
GitHub
Keep the repository public
Given that all project code is sent to the client-side and therefore accessible in everyone's browser, we recommend keeping the repository as public. Adobe has a longstanding history in the open-source community and generally advocates for code to be public unless there is a compelling reason to make it private.
Maintaining a public repository offers several benefits of open source projects like community code reviews, and developers are able to share knowledge and code, in turn fostering innovation and collaboration. Public repositories also make it quick and easy for Adobe and other developers to create free pull requests to help improve your project and automatic PSI checks (on the feature branches) are provided by Adobe, which are not enabled by default for private repositories.
If you still have a strong need to keep your repository private, be aware that certain features are only available in paid plans for private repositories, such as branch protection rules and limited CI/CD minutes. For more details, please see GitHub’s pricing page.
Create pull requests
If you work on a project with multiple developers it is rarely a good idea to push directly to main. When your project is in production code changes that are merged or pushed to main often means that they are released to production. Protecting your main branch is a good mechanism to ensure that people don’t push to main by accident, which is especially advisable with a site that is in production.
Pull request etiquette
If you open a pull request, make sure that you include a URL to a page (or a number of links to pages) on your branch, where the reviewer can see your code in action. If you are updating code of an existing block, make sure to include the link that features the block you are updating as the reviewer may not know where this block is in use to test its functionality.
Keep the scope of your Pull Request to what’s in the title/description of the PR.
For work still in progress, opening a Draft Pull Request helps prevent wasting people's time with reviewing code still in flux as well as accidental merging.
Linting
The standard boilerplate setup runs the linting tools eslint (airbnb-base) and stylelint for each change in a Pull Request. Do not submit a Pull Request with linting errors for review.
Changing the linting configuration is not recommended unless you have a really good reason. Personal preference is not a good reason. Changing linting rules makes it difficult to reuse code from the AEM boilerplate, block collection or other open source AEM projects. Arguing if something is a good reason to change the linting rules is usually a lot more effort than just categorically saying no.
PageSpeed Insights
The AEM Code Sync GitHub app runs Google PageSpeed Insights for each change in a pull request to assess the impact on Web Performance, Accessibility, SEO and Best Practices. Do not submit a pull request for review that doesn’t have a green Lighthouse Score for mobile and desktop, ideally 100 for both.
Reviews
It is good practice to have your code reviewed by the maintainer or main developer of the project you are working on. This can be encouraged by setting up branch protection on main to require pull requests with at least 1 approval before any code can be merged. You can still allow project administrators to bypass branch protection settings for emergencies.
Shared branches
It is good practice to consider branches for individual Pull Requests as private to the developer who created the branch. Do not just push into other developers’ branches without having been invited to do so. There are situations where people are collaborating on Pull Requests but it should be an explicit agreement.
Merging pull requests (deploying to production)
Merge your own pull requests only. If the person who opened the Pull Request has the ability to merge their own Pull Request, the author of the code is the ideal person to merge. There are situations where the author specifically states that this can and should be merged by someone else, and in those cases a maintainer (main developer) of the project should feel free to merge a Pull Request.
Even if a Pull Request is approved, you should always check with the author of the Pull Request if they are ready to merge.
The AEM Code Sync GitHub app will automatically deploy changes merged into the main branch to production.
(Scaled) Trunk-based development
For AEM projects with their built-in devops and CI/CD, we recommend following the scaled trunk-based development model. This means you merge small pull requests into production often, but the quality assurance & review efforts are limited to small change sets. Nobody wants to review and test large pull requests, and long-lived branches with lots of changes tend to be difficult (and dangerous) to merge.
Dependency management
Make sure your dependencies are kept up to date. Even if you don't add more dependencies, it is good practice to keep the minimal out of the box dependencies (linting) up to date. Feel free to use tools like Renovate.
CSS
CSS selector block isolation
AEM blocks most often operate as components collaboratively in the same DOM / CSSOM. This means that you should write your CSS selectors in a block .css in a way that isolates your CSS from impacting layout of elements outside your block. The easiest way to do this is by making sure that every CSS selector in the .css of a block only applies to the block.
Cascade in CSS
Use your CSS classnames wisely. Some CSS classes and variables are used across different blocks, and others are not expected to be used outside your block. Prefixing classes and variables that are private to your block with the block name is good practice. Conversely, if there are CSS classes and CSS context that should be inherited (often those can be authored) those classes and variables should not be prefixed.
CSS indentation and property order
Outside of a CSS refactoring PR, don’t change sequencing on properties or the indentation across the CSS files you touch in a functional PR. Every developer has different preferences on sort order of properties or indentation. Make sure the diff that you see in your PR is isolated to the changes you actually want reviewed before submitting it.
CSS selectors complexity
Don’t let your CSS Selectors become complex and unreadable. Often it is better to decorate additional CSS classes/Elements onto your DOM and write readable CSS instead. Complex CSS selectors also often are harder to maintain and more brittle than the equivalents in JS.
CSS naming
Naming your classes simple and intuitive is helpful for other developers. Avoid namespacing unless it is necessary within the scope of a project. There is often no need to specify the type or the origin (e.g. the name of your design system) of a CSS variable that is to be used across the entire project.
Leverage ARIA attributes for styling
In many situations you will add ARIA Attributes for accessibility. Since those have well defined semantics like expanded or hidden that are understood by all developers, in most cases there is really no need to come up with additional classes in your vocabulary that have unknown semantics.
Mobile first
Generally Web projects should be developed “Mobile First”. This means that your CSS without media query should render a mobile site. Add media queries to extend the layout for tablet and desktop.
Breakpoints
Generally use 600px, 900px and 1200px as your breakpoints, all min-width. Don’t mix min-width and max-width. Only use different breakpoints in exceptional cases where you have good understanding why that’s needed.
Less, Sass, PostCSS, Tailwind and friends.
If you are working in the context of a bigger organization, make sure that you don’t introduce a dependency to any CSS preprocessor or framework of your personal preference without getting the buy-in from the entire team and organization. As there are a lot of differing personal preferences in this area, it makes code hard to maintain if every project or every block inside a project uses different technologies.The simplest solution is to rely on the growing CSS feature set which is supported by the browsers.
Modern CSS features
Make sure the features you are using are well supported by evergreen browsers. Depending on the features more or less pervasive support may be acceptable.
JavaScript
Frameworks
On most web sites, frameworks are overkill for simple layout problems outside of application-like functionality. Frameworks often introduce web performance issues (Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals), particularly if they are in the pathway of the LCP or introduce TBT, while trying to address trivial problems. Keep simple things simple.If you are using Javascript Frameworks make sure that you don’t introduce a dependency to any JS Framework or library of your personal preference without getting the buy-in from the entire team and organization. As there are a lot of personal preferences, it makes code hard to maintain if every project or every block inside a project uses different technologies.The simplest solution is to rely on the growing feature set supported by browsers.
Build tool chain
Differing build tool chains from project to project make it hard for new developers to be onboarded and often introduce additional complexity. Make sure that you don’t introduce a dependency of your personal preference without getting the buy-in from the entire team and organization.The simplest solution is to keep the entire project build-less.
Modern JavaScript features
Make sure the features you are using are well supported by evergreen browsers. Depending on the features more or less pervasive support may be acceptable. While AEM can be used with any browser, aem.js has a dependency on browsers that support dynamic import(). Any feature that is supported by the set of browsers that support dynamic import() should be considered safe. Technically, of course, older browsers (e.g., IE) can be supported by AEM projects, but those require heavy customization.
Not all features have the same consequences if a browser doesn’t support them, some may be cosmetic and others may stop the site from working. A common example is “optional chaining”. If a browser doesn’t support “optional chaining”, a single usage can have fatal consequences for the entire page.
Loading 3rd party libraries
Don’t add 3rd party libraries to your <head> via head.html as they will be in the critical path of loading content above the fold and will often be loaded when they are not needed. Add the dependencies where needed via loadScript() to the specific block that has the corresponding requirement.In case of larger 3rd party libraries, you may even want to consider using an IntersectionObserver to make sure you only load them when the block depending on it is actually being scrolled into view.
AEM library (aem.js)
The AEM library (usually called aem.js in a boilerplate project) is currently not minified and obfuscated to make debugging easier. We discourage making changes to it on a project basis and instead recommend project specific extensions to be kept outside of the library. We welcome Pull Requests via GitHub, if you would like to propose changes or bug fixes that are universally applicable.
<head>
The <head> that is delivered from the server as part of the HTML markup should remain minimal and free of marketing technology like Adobe Web SDK, Google Tag Manager or other 3rd party scripts due to performance impacts. Adding inline scripts or styles to <head> is also not advisable for performance and code management reasons.
Minification
Typically this is additional complexity without much benefit unless you have really large JS/CSS files which again would be an anti-pattern. With Edge Delivery, the way the code is structured around blocks, the files should be usually small in size and minifying should not make much of a difference. To be sure, you can compare the Lighthouse Score pre/post minification.Minification makes code slightly harder to debug and you'd need sourcemaps. Also minifying requires an additional build step which can potentially slow down site development work. So you’d want to go there only if there is a tangible benefit of this additional complexity
Content first
Start your development with content
Before writing a line of code, create your (sample) content in a Word or Google Doc (or spreadsheet). Make sure that it feels good for authoring and share it with people on your team that have experience supporting authors. It requires support experience to understand what content structures are easy for authors to understand and recreate. Once you have settled on a content structure that contains all elements you need for your block, and have it reviewed you can get started developing your CSS and JS code.
Use drafts
The content lifecycle is very different from the code life cycle. If you are proposing changes to an existing content structure in your code or come up with a new block, don’t just make those changes on the page you are working on. Copy the page into your /drafts/<yourname>/ folder and make changes there.Once your code changes are merged to main , you can have authors copy or merge your content with the content outside of your /drafts/ folder.
Backwards compatibility of new features
Especially in production environments it is important to keep your anticipated changes to the content structure backwards compatible with existing content. Ideally, code that is being merged should not have an impact on the website or require refactoring the content. Only when new content is put in place through a preview and publish cycle, the new functionality becomes available. This of course doesn’t apply to things like design changes across the existing content or functional bug fixes.
Use content for “static” resources
Generally, it is not a good idea to commit binaries into your GitHub repo. Even text-based static resources, for example HTML files or SVGs should only be put into GitHub in exceptional cases. A good reason to add an SVG to your git repo is if it is referenced from code. Don’t commit anything that is related to the content authoring process, or could be a part of an authoring process. There are some exceptions (usually related to legacy and non-browser clients) that require a certain set of fixed resources that cannot be produced and manipulated dynamically by AEM, but in general if you find a large set of static resources (e.g. images, etc.) or an HTML file in a PR it is most likely not a good practice.
Use content for strings/literals
Strings that are displayed to end users and could possibly be translated or changed at some point should always be authorable and sourced from content (eg. placeholders or other spreadsheets or documents). If you have a literal string that is displayed as text to the visitor of your website via javascript or css code, it is good practice to replace it with a reference to content.

https://www.aem.live/developer/placeholders

Using Placeholders
In most websites, there are strings or variables that will be used throughout the site. Especially in sites that need to support multiple languages, it is not a good idea to hard code such values. Instead placeholders can be used and managed centrally.
For information on how to author placeholders, see the placeholders documentation in the publish section.
Note: the placeholders feature has been moved to the block-collection repository and is not part of the boilerplate.
You can import fetchPlaceholders in your block’s JS or scripts.js and use it as follows to retrieve placeholder strings. You probably have some function or logic in your project to determine the language of the current page based on its path or metadata. In this example, we’ll simply hardcode it to en. This means it will fetch a placeholders sheet in the en folder. Omitting the argument will assume there’s a placeholders sheet in the root folder.
Key formatting
Keys which contain spaces or dashes in the placeholder sheet will be camel-cased for easier access in JavaScript:
about us will become aboutUs
foo-bar will become fooBar
VIP lounge will become VipLounge
You can use the helper function toCamelCase to convert keys to property names.

Operational Telemetry
Adobe Experience Manager uses Operational Telemetry to gather operations data that is strictly necessary to discover and fix functional and performance issues on Adobe Experience Manager-powered sites. Operational Telemetry data can be used to diagnose performance issues. Operational Telemetry preserves the privacy of visitors through sampling (only a small portion of all page views will be monitored).
Privacy
Operational Telemetry in Adobe Experience Manager is designed to preserve visitor privacy and minimize data collection. As a visitor, this means that Adobe will not attempt to collect personal information about you or information that can be tracked back to you. As a site operator, review the data items collected below to understand if they require consent.AEM Operational Telemetry does not use any client-side state or ID, such as cookies or localStorage, sessionStorage or similar, to collect usage metrics. Data is submitted transparently through a Navigator.sendBeacon call, not through pixels or similar techniques. There is no “fingerprinting” of devices or individuals via their IP address, User Agent string, or any other data for the purpose of capturing sampled data.
It is not permitted to add any personal data into the Operational Telemetry data collection nor may Operational Telemetry data be used for use cases that go beyond strictly necessary.
Operational Telemetry data is sampled
Traditional web analytics solutions try to collect every single visitor. Adobe Experience Manager’s Operational Telemetry only captures information from a small fraction of activities tied to page views, with no concept of identifying a visitor or a user or even a browser session. Under normal circumstances the sampling rate is one out of one hundred page views , although site operators can decide to increase or decrease this number.
As the decision if data will be collected is made on a page view by page view basis, it cannot be used to track interactions across multiple pages. Operational Telemetry has no concept of visits, visitors, or sessions, only checkpoints during a page view. This is by design.
What data is being collected
Operational Telemetry is designed to prevent the collection of personally identifiable information. The full set of information that can be collected by Adobe Experience Manager’s Operational Telemetry is:
The host name of the site being visited, such as www.aem.live
The host name of the server responsible for the data collection such as rum.hlx.live
The user agent (technical name of the browser) that is used to display the page such as Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 14_4_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.0.3 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1. This string is then simplified to desktop, desktop:windows, desktop:mac, desktop:linux, mobile, mobile:android, mobile:ios, mobile:ipados, or bot so that only the device class is stored.
The time of the data collection such as 2021-06-26 06:00:02.596000 UTC (in order to preserve privacy, we round all minutes to the previous hour, so that only seconds and milliseconds are tracked)
The URL of the page being visited, such as https://www.aem.live/docs/operational-telemetry if the URL contains URL parameters, these parameters will not be collected or stored
The Referrer URL (the URL of the page that linked to the current page) such as https://www.aem.live/docs
A randomly generated ID of the page view such as 2Ac6
The weight or inverse of the sampling rate such as 100 (this means only one in one hundred page views will be recorded)
The checkpoint, or name of a particular event in the sequence of loading the page or interacting with it as a visitor such as viewmedia (this particular checkpoint is fired when an image becomes at least 25% visible in the browser)
The source, or identifier of the DOM element that the received the interaction event with for the checkpoint mentioned above such as .images
The target, or link to an external page or resource that received and interaction with for the checkpoint mentioned above such as https://blog.adobe.com/jp/publish/2022/06/29/media_162fb947c7219d0537cce36adf22315d64fb86e94.png
The Core Web Vitals (CWV) performance metrics Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) that describe the visitor’s quality of experience.
The foundational performance metric Time to First Byte (TTFB) that describes the visitors's quality of experience
No other data is being collected.
What data is being stored in the visitor's browser
For sites that use the built-in experimentation feature, the name of the experiment and variants that the visitor has seen are also stored in the browser's session storage.
How Operational Telemetry data is being used
Adobe uses Operational Telemetry data for following purposes:
To identify and fix performance bottlenecks on customer sites
To estimate the number of page views to customer sites
To understand how Adobe Experience Manager interacts with other scripts (such as analytics, targeting, or external libraries) on the same page to increase compatibility
These use cases are strictly necessary to ensure sites running on AEM are working for their visitors.
Data Overview
The data collected and stored is designed to prevent:
Identification of individual visitors or devices
Fingerprinting
Tracking of visits or sessions
Enrichment or combination with personal identifiable information from other sources
Other than Adobe, following third parties are involved in the collection of Operational Telemetry data:
Fastly, Inc
Cloudflare, Inc
Coralogix LTD
Google LLC
Amazon.com, Inc
Operational Telemetry for Developers
We have additional in-depth information for developers that want to use data to optimize their own sites, including instructions on how to add Operational Telemetry instrumentation to your site, even if it's not running on AEM.

Developing Operational Telemetry in AEM
Adobe Experience Manager uses Operational Telemetry to diagnose usage and performance of web sites running on Adobe Experience Manager. As a developer, you can use the Operational Telemetry APIs to observe additional events about how your site is used.
This document describes the key concepts of Real Use Monitoring, details the client-side APIs that you can use to send additional data to the Operational Telemetry collection service and alludes to the fact that the data can be queried.
How to add Operational Telemetry Instrumentation to your Site
If your website is not built using AEM Edge Delivery Services, it is recommended to set up Real Use Monitoring in standalone mode. To set up , simply add the following script to your pages.
<script defer type="text/javascript" src="https://rum.hlx.page/.rum/@adobe/helix-rum-js@^2/dist/rum-standalone.js"></script>
For better performance, it is recommended loading the script after the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) event
Key Concepts
Every data point collected by Operational Telemetry is made up of following key parts:
id – a unique identifier, generated by the Operational Telemetry library that identifies the current page view
checkpoint – a named event in the sequence of loading the page, and interacting with the page
source – identifies the DOM element that caused a particular interaction (optional)
target – identifies an external resource or link that is the subject of an interaction (optional)
Checkpoints
By convention, checkpoint names are lowercase letters, without any special characters. The most common checkpoints used in Adobe Experience Manager projects are:
top – the page loading sequence has begun and first JavaScript code is being executed by the page. This event fires even before blocks are decorated or content is visible
load – corresponds to the Window: load event in JavaScript and is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and images.
cwv – indicates that either the page is ready to collect Core Web Vitals (CWV) readings or that either the LCP, CLS, or FID CWV reading has been recorded. As these readings are asynchronous, multiple of these checkpoints can be passed during one page view
lazy – the page is ready for lazy loading of non-essential resources as part of the Lazy stage of the ELD cycle.
lcp – the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) has been made by the browser, this is usually the most prominent image on the page
viewblock – a block has scrolled into view and there is a chance that the content of that block is seen. The class name of the block will be shared in the source property.
viewmedia – an image or video has scrolled into view and there is a chance that the content of that block is seen. The URL of the image or video is shared in the target property.
click – a click event has been triggered, not just on links or buttons. If the element clicked is a link, then the link target is recorded in the target property. The source property contains information about which element of the DOM was clicked.
experiment – an experiment (challenger or control) has been presented, which can be an A/B test or targeted content.
error – a JavaScript error has occurred on the page and has not been handled by the application code. This usually indicates a bug.
404 – a 404, page not found page has been served. This checkpoint can indicate missing content or broken links
unsupported – the page has been opened by a browser that does not support the more advanced Operational Telemetry collection features. This checkpoint is fired by less than a tenth of a percent of all page views. There is also the related noscript checkpoint for browsers that do not have JavaScript enabled, which is even less common.
search – a site search on the page is performed, typically using a search input field
formsubmit – a form is submitted on the page. The form action is recorded in the target property, while the source property keeps information of which form of the page was submitted.
leave – corresponds to the Window: pagehide event or to Document: visibilitychange event (whichever happens first) if the new document.visibilityState is hidden. This checkpoint is triggered when the page is not visible anymore, e.g. when the browser is closed, or when switched to a different tab in the browser.

Operational Telemetry
Every AEM Site, including Adobe Experience Manager Sites as a Cloud Service without Edge Delivery Services, collects metrics and data by default. This data is sampled, and used by Adobe to diagnose issues around performance, traffic acquisition, and conversion for customer sites.
With Operational Telemetry, Adobe offers a simple user interface to explore the collected data for a given domain. It is a simple data visualization tool for authors, site owners, developers, and operations teams to understand how their site is doing and what can be improved.
Insights in the Operational Telemetry are meant to be shared, therefore for each view of the Operational Telemetry explorer, you can copy, paste, and share the URL from the browser to invite team members to look over the data.
All Operational Telemetry data is sampled, which means each data point represents hundreds, or even thousands of page views. This sampling means that data analysis is fast, but it also means that, like in every measurement system, there is a margin of error. Hover the mouse over a number displayed to see the margin of error. Sampling also means that the uncertainty in the data rises when you filter out more of the data.
User Interface Overview
Operational Telemetry is available at https://www.aem.live/tools/oversight/explorer.html and you need a domain key to access the data for most domains. Data for the website emigrationbrewing.com, a small but great Salt Lake City-based restaurant is open for everyone, so you can explore it under https://www.aem.live/tools/oversight/explorer.html?domain=emigrationbrewing.com&view=month&domainkey=open
The user interface is broken down in three parts:
Key metrics on the top left. These key metrics are split into business metrics (page views, visits, engagement) and performance metrics (Largest Contentful Paint, Cumulative Layout Shift, Interaction to Next Paint) and will update whenever you change the filters.
A chart on the bottom left that provides an at-a glance visualization of your data. The default visualization is to show page views and performance metrics over time.
A set of facets that allow you to drill down into the data on the right. Each facet comes with checkboxes that allow you to filter the full data set to only include matching page views and three kinds of metrics around performance, traffic acquisition, and engagement.
Date Ranges
Operational Telemetry explorer allows you to look at the data over time, to identify recent, short-term and long-term trends. Under each of the key metrics at the top of the page you can find a small green or red line telling you at a glance if there is a positive or negative trend.
Weekly View
Viewing by Week is done by changing the dropdown to the right of the URL from Month to Week. Data in the chart is broken down by hour, which gives more precision than the default Month view which is broken down by day. Please be aware of the tradeoff of zooming in more closely - the benefits of having a smaller dataset for each hour can reveal an extrapolation-related drawback if there is not much data collected in a given hour.
Yearly View
It is also possible to zoom out and see data for a full year, broken down by week.
Additional Views
The default view explored so far is the timeline view. For some data, this is not the best visualization and alternative drill down views are offered. To enter a drill down view, locate a facet on the right side of the screen, click the little arrow pointing downwards, and you'll see data for that facet alone visualized.
When you've seen enough, click the arrow pointing upward to navigate back.
Device Share
In the Device Type and Operating System facet, there is a small down arrow box. Clicking this drill down updates the chart on the screen to become a pie chart which shows how different devices use the site. The inner pie represents the distribution of Operational Telemetry data collection among the major device type categories - desktop, mobile, and bot. The outer pie breaks it down further by the operating system category. Click the up arrow box in the facet header to return to the original chart view.
Top URLs
You can navigate to the top URLs bar chart from the URL facet in the sidebar. For each URL, you can see the distribution of performance metrics. Pages with good performance appear green, pages with poor performance red. For some pages there is not enough data, these are shown in gray.
Flow Diagram (Sankey)
The final visualization is the flow diagram (also called a Sankey diagram, after the inventor of this style of chart). It allows you to see how visitors enter a page (on the left), consume content and engage with it (in the middle) and leave the page, or stop interacting with it (on the right)
Focus Modes
Depending on whether you are an author, a marketer, a developer, or a designer, different aspects of the data matter to you. The focus mode selector at the top right of the facet sidebar allows you to select a view that fits your needs.
Performance Focus
The default focus is the performance focus and it shows Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and Interaction to Next Paint (INP).
Green indicators mean that this performance metric is in a good state, yellow means it needs improvement, and red means performance is poor.
Do not read "needs improvement" as "it is not great, but acceptable", our data shows that anything that is not marked green leads to significant decreases of user experience, and therefore higher bounce rate and lower engagement.
For each of the focus views, a thick border around the facet metric means that there is a significant difference in that metric compared to the baseline (all page views). These are the areas that deserve further investigation.
Traffic Acquisition Focus
It does not matter how fast a site is if it can't attract and keep visitors. This is what the traffic acquisition focus is all about.
The core metrics for traffic acquisition are:
Bounce Rate (BOUNCE): this is the share of traffic that enters your site, and leaves immediately without clicking anywhere on the page. Accepting a consent banner isn't counted as a click for this metric. Generally this metric should be as low as possible, but any value below 50% is great.
Time on page (TIME): how long does a page view take on average? Longer times indicate that visitors are deeply engaged with your content, short times mean that the page isn't able to hold their attention
Organic Percentage (ORGANIC): great pages are able to attract traffic organically, i.e. without having to buy ads to acquire traffic. The organic percentage is the share of traffic that enters your page without following an ad. Internal navigation isn't considered when calculating organic share.
Conversion or Engagement
This focus mode can show one of two metrics:
Engagement Rate (ENGAGEMENT) is the percentage of page views where visitors either consumed significant amounts of content or clicked. Engagement rates can be very high, often reaching up to 90%.
Conversion Rate (CONVERSION) requires a custom conversion definition, which allows you to declare what kind of engagement is most valuable. This rate is often in the single digits, and a 5% rate can be good for many sites.
Exploring the Data
The fastest way to drill down into your data is to type a term into the search field above the facet sidebar. Any data point that has the search term either in the URL or in the checkpoints will be considered, the match will be highlighted and you can quickly see what has been found.
The facets offer a more structured approach to drilling down on the data. Each data point is classified across multiple dimensions, and you can include or exclude any category of page views depending on their facet values.
Device Type and Operating System
Operational Telemetry does not track the user agents to preserve visitor privacy, but from the information available it can discern the broad device classes Mobile, Desktop, and Bot. Bot includes crawlers that access your site and execute JavaScript. The bot traffic you will see on the Operational Telemetry explorer is smaller than what you would see in your CDN statistics, as most bots do not execute JavaScript and do not try to mimic a visitor. An important exception are search engines, which do execute JavaScript and are visible in Operational Telemetry explorer.
For each broad device class, the operating system of the browser is broken out, too. This allows you to distinguish between macOS and Windows (and Linux, too – although some bots disguise themselves as Linux visitors) and between iOS and Android. You will notice that the iOS traffic does not report Core Web Vitals, which is a limitation of the browsers available on iOS.
If you click a checkbox for a device class, you will see all traffic in that device class, regardless of operating system. If you check a checkbox for an operating system, you will only see the traffic of that operating system. Selecting multiple checkboxes will show all traffic that satisfies any of the checked boxes.
Use the Device Type and Operating System Facet to determine whether the operating system has influence on experience quality and visitor behavior.
If you want to include a facet, click the checkbox and only data points that fulfill the criteria are included. To exclude a facet, hold the shift key while clicking the checkbox and that category will be excluded. In the screenshot above, all Bot traffic has been excluded from the overall count.
URL
The URL facet shows the different pages that make up your site. In some cases, when URLs contain long numbers, or other types of IDs, all paths following the same pattern will be grouped together to make it easier to identify patterns.
Checkpoints
Checkpoints represent the type of activity collected. Each different checkpoint includes additional data, which can be seen by checking the box next to a checkpoint. For example, checking the Visit Entry (enter) checkpoint will load an additional facet named External Referrer. Checking the Clicked (click) checkpoint will load two additional facets - Click Source which shows CSS selectors to help identify where on the page a user clicked, and Click Target which shows where the clicks take the user. Try out the various checkpoints and see what insights are available.
Checkpoint-Specific Facets
The following facets only appear when you've selected the corresponding checkpoint.
Facet: Viewmedia
You can see the CSS selector of the image (Media Source) and a preview of the image or video that has been seen (Media Target).
Facet: Viewblock
This facet allows you to identify the blocks that visitors have seen. The CSS selector includes the block name, and can include additional information such as dialog for elements that are fixed in the viewport and can't be scrolled away.
Facet: Navigate
This facet enables us to discover internal navigation paths. For external referrers, the enter checkpoint can be used.
Facet: Enter
For external referrers, often only the domain name, or in case of Android apps, the name of the Android application is visible. The value direct subsumes visitors entering the URL directly into their address bar, following browser bookmarks, or opening the page from iOS applications.
Facet: LCP
Drilling down into the LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) checkpoint allows a developer to identify elements of the page that are slowing down page loading. It is often ideal to combine this with a URL filter, as LCP elements vary from page to page and between desktop and mobile browsers.
Facet: Click
The click checkpoint tracks where on the page visitors clicked (CSS Selector) and what links have been clicked. This is useful for identifying internal and external navigation targets.
Conversion Definition
The most in-depth analysis that you can perform with Operational Telemetry explorer is to understand conversion rates. As Operational telemetry does not require any special instrumentation of the page to identify conversions, defining what a conversion is can be done ad-hoc.
This is a three-step process:
Filter the traffic (using facets) down to traffic that is a valid conversion
Redefine the conversion definition using that filter
Analyze the data using the new conversion definition
Whenever facet values have been selected in the sidebar and no conversion has been defined yet, the Engagement key metric area will feature a "redefine" button. Use the filters to select traffic that matches your defined criteria. In this example, we select visitors who have scrolled down far enough to see the footer of the page, so the criteria is a combination of the viewblock checkpoint and the Block CSS Selector (target).
A
After clicking redefine, the draft conversion definition will be highlighted and a confirm button will appear. Click the confirm button to dial in the new conversion definition.
Your new conversion definition has been applied and all elements that referred to Engagement so far will now use the conversion definition. Please note that conversion rate is calculated against the baseline of visits, not against page views like the engagement rate.

Text
Notes:
A Text Paragraph (or Copy) is the most common element on websites. AEM understands and translates a number of semantic formatting like bold, italic, underline, strike-through as well as subscript and superscript, which are translated to their respective semantic HTML tags of <strong>, <em>, <u>, <s>, <sup> and <sub>.
CSS styling may take hints from these formatting options and use them to express visually very different styling. Both a paragraph and line-feed are supported.
The first portion of the first text paragraph serves as the default description for the a page if nothing else is specified in metadata.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
The content structure is based on the simple Normal Text paragraphs in word or google doc.
See Content in Document
Code:
As text is Default Content it is styled in project or block CSS code. There is usually no JavaScript code used.This code is included in boilerplate, there is no need to copy it.https://github.com/adobe/helix-project-boilerplate/blob/27e8571592220da8ded7c8a7e5064d982f7cfe76/styles/styles.css#L45-L51

Headings
Notes:
Semantic headings are the backbone of any document structure. In documents you should always follow the semantic hierarchy of your document, meaning that a Heading 1 should contain a Heading 2 which in turn should contain a Heading 3 and so forth.In cases where you find yourself using the headings out of sequence or leaving gaps in the heading hierarchy, that’s usually an indication that you are either trying to use headings to adjust to visual or design constraints or you are using headings for something that is semantically not a heading. Either of those can lead to bad results.
According to Web best practices there should only be a single Heading 1 per page, which will also be used as the default title for the document.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
The Content Structure leverages the built-in Heading 1 - Heading 6 mapped to h1 through h6.
See Content in Document
Code:
As headings are default content they are styled in project or block CSS code. There is usually no JavaScript code used.
There is no code related to list generic styling in Boilerplate.

Images
Notes:
Pictures, Illustrations and Images are an integral part of making a web experience both more informative and also more engaging. Simply add images to your documents either by inserting them or just copy/paste images from your source.
Add Alt-texts to your images to make your content more accessible. Both Word and Google Docs have great support for that.
AEM automatically takes care of resizing the images to the appropriate size for the website and converting them into the formats that make sense for the consuming browser.
We recommend inserting your images with at least a width of 2000 pixels if available, so even at a large display resolution the images will still be crisp.
The first image on a page will automatically become the image that is used in metadata (for social media and messaging applications) unless defined otherwise in metadata.
Special Mention for GDocs: Google downsizes the images to a maximum of 1600 pixels width or 1600 height. This is still sufficient for most use cases of photography images, but for some illustrations it can lead to visible artifacts.
Example:

Lists
Notes:
Lists serve many purposes in the Web in general, some uses or obvious lists inside default content, while others are used in navigations or other hierarchical constructs.
Extraction of nested numbered lists and bullet lists is supported. Lists are converted to the <ol> and <ul> HTML tags respectively.
Complex list items seem to be hard to manage in word processing without accidentally being broken up so it is generally recommended to keep lists relatively simple when it comes to the complexity of the items in the list.
Example:

Links
Notes:
Hyperlinks are essential to connect websites and your content. To create a link, just use the insert link option in word or google doc.
Links can be added across all the default content and the different formatting options.
In Word and Google Docs only absolute links are accepted, which is usually easier to copy paste from your browser. Links are automatically converted to be relative to your site, while external links are kept absolute.
Links are often used beyond text links and reference for example embedded media or referenced fragments that are inlined in the page.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
See Content in Document
Code:
As links are considered Default Content they are styled in project or block CSS code. There is usually no JavaScript code used.There is no link related styling code in the boilerplate project.
Special Mention: Microsoft Word Online does not allow links on images, so a workaround would be to let authors put a link directly below the image and then wrap it on the client side, e.g.
Special Mention: It is recommended to handle certain links that need to be opened in a new window based on whether they are external links or PDFs (for example) on the client side, e.g.

Buttons
Notes:
Websites very often contain buttons, as call to actions or more generically. By default in the Boilerplate project buttons are created as a link in a paragraph by itself.
Bold and Italic (<strong> and <em>) and possibly combinations thereof are used to specify certain types of buttons. There are often primary and secondary buttons and the default styling is usually defined for default content and/or specified by a containing block, and Bold and Italic can be used to specify alternative variations of buttons.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
See Content in Document
Code:
As Buttons are considered Default Content they are styled in project or block CSS code.
There is Javascript code for decoration purposes that is included in the default boilerplate behavior and it usually remains unchanged.Decoration CodeThe CSS Styling is very project specific and gets adjusted as needed for a project or block by block.

All the code above is part of the Boilerplate project and does not need to be copied.

Code
Notes:
Most technical documentation websites (including this one) have the need to display code. Most marketing websites don’t have that requirement, but since there is an intuitive and simple styling and markup the notion of code elements both inline and preformatted multiline is supported out of the box.
Formatting something in word or gdoc as a fixed font (eg. Courier New) will automatically output a <code> element or a <code> and <pre> block for multiline.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
See Content in Document
Code:
As the code functionality is part of Default Content it is usually really just a matter of styling things according to the project specific CSS rules.This code is part of boilerplate so there is no need to copy it.

https://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection/sections

Sections
Notes:
Sections are the top level grouping mechanism in documents, think of them as containers for a set of default content and blocks. Learn more about the Document Structure here.
Sections are separated by “Horizontal Rules” or --- to group certain elements of a page together. There may be both semantic and design reasons to group content together, a simple case could be that a section of a page has a different background color.
Technically a section just introduces a <div> wrapper in the markup delivered around all the blocks and default content contained in the section.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
See Content in Document
Code:
In most cases generic sections don’t have much styling code beyond project specific box layout (eg. margins, padding, max-width) and are sometimes augmented with section metadata to control styling (often background colors or images).
See Section Styling Code

https://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection/icons

Icons
Notes:
Most if not all websites have icons, therefore there is a simple way to reference icons for authors.
Icons are referenced as :<iconname>: notation. As there are different ways to implement icons in the browser either as plain css classes, icon fonts or SVG, we offer a non-intrusive way to support all of those.
The boilerplate project includes an automatic mechanism to insert SVGs into the icon `<span>`s as that’s the most common way to deal with icons.
While some icons need to be in the code (icons referenced in blocks for example), there are times when authors need to add and reference new icons and update them on an ongoing basis. These icons can and should live with the content under an /icons/ folder in the content source (eg. Sharepoint or Google Drive). These icons can also be referenced the exact same way using the :<iconname>: notation. This will allow marketers to add and update icons they need for content without any dependency on a code change.
Example:
See Live output
Content Structure:
The :<iconname>: can be inserted as a part of all Default Content constructs.
See Content in Document
Code:
Icons are Default Content and are styled in project specific CSS code. If there is any JavaScript that is required to load the SVGs it can be adapted as needed.This code is included in Boilerplate, there is no need to copy it.
See SVG loading Code

Importing Content
AEM offers the capability to easily import an existing site and convert its content to docx files for document-based authoring, HTML files for Document Authoring, or content packages for AEM authoring with the Universal Editor.
Import Concept
If you copy the content of a web page by selecting Select All and Copy in the browser and paste the selection inside a Word or a Google Doc document, you will see that both programs can easily convert the copied DOM elements into their own basic document elements. An HTML h1 becomes text styled with Heading 1. Any span, div, or p element becomes a Normal paragraph. An image is inserted as an image. Et cetera.
The AEM Importer recognizes and understands these same page semantics and allows you to import content into:
docx files for document-based authoring with Google Drive or SharePoint
Content packages for AEM authoring with the Universal Editor
HTML for Document Authoring (DA)
Check out the document Where to author if you are not familiar with AEM’s authoring options.
The importer offers the tooling to automate the process for multiple pages of a site to be imported and converted.
You start from an existing web page (the DOM is the input).
You apply a set of transformations (to remove unnecessary elements, reorder or transform some of the elements, perform cleanup, etc.).
The importer creates a docx document, a content package, or HTML for you.
Getting Started
While the content import is one of the first steps to be performed in a project, you need to be familiar with AEM, especially the desired structure of your content.
It is good practice to make example imports of each page type you wish to import. You can thereby confirm that the authors find the resulting structures intuitive. This also allows parallelization of the content import with the development work for blocks and styling. If you are using document-based authoring, you can do this by creating manual imports using copy/paste from the source website into a Word or Google Docs document.
Structuring your content in an intuitive manner is an important step in an AEM project. See the documents Markup, Sections, Blocks and Auto Blocking and David’s Model, Second take for more information.
A project is usually ready for an import roughly at the end of the tutorial. See the following documents for more information.
Getting Started – Universal Editor Developer Tutorial
Getting Started with AEM - Developer Tutorial
How to use Sharepoint (application)
Getting Started – Document Authoring (DA) Developer Tutorial
At the end of the tutorials, you can simply run the following command.
aem import
This starts the AEM Importer. You can run this instead of or in addition to aem up.
The helix-importer-ui project will be cloned under the tools/importer/helix-importer-ui folder.
The import proxy server starts and a new browser window opens at http://localhost:3001/tools/importer/helix-importer-ui/index.html
As a first step, you must choose your authoring method so the importer UI presents the appropriate options. In the Authoring Experience Selection modal select one of the following and click Ok.
Document Authoring if you will be using document-based authoring or Document Authoring (DA)
AEM Authoring if you are using AEM and the Universal Editor to edit your content
Document Authoring if you will be using document-based authoring or Document Authoring (DA)
AEM Authoring if you are using AEM and the Universal Editor to edit your content
Select your authoring experience when first starting the importer
If you make the wrong selection for your authoring type or otherwise need to change it, click the project picker drop-down in the bottom-right corner of the importer window and select the appropriate option.
Document Authoring
AEM Authoring
Reset to be prompted with the Authoring Experience Selection modal again to make your selection
The bottom-left of the importer window displays your current version of the importer UI as well as the AEM CLI tool.
The AEM Importer
The AEM Importer offers a set of tools to support you to quickly import your website content.
Please note that only Chrome-based browsers are supported.
Import - Workbench
The Import Workbench is where you define and start your import process. The UI differs depending on the authoring method you initially selected.
Document Authoring
Performing an initial import for document-based authoring is quite simple.
Provide a URL (https://wknd.site/us/en.html in our sample case) of a page to import.
Define your desired output.
By default, under Import Options, Save as docx is selected, which is required for document-based authoring.
Select Save HTML for Document Authoring, if you are using DA.
If you select multiple options, subdirectories are created in your selected destination for the various formats.
If you only select one option, no subdirectory is created.
By default, under Import Options, Save as docx is selected, which is required for document-based authoring.
Select Save HTML for Document Authoring, if you are using DA.
If you select multiple options, subdirectories are created in your selected destination for the various formats.
If you only select one option, no subdirectory is created.
Click the Import button.
The importer triggers the browser to ask you where you want to save the resulting docx file (for document-based authoring) or HTML (for Document Authoring) and for confirmation that the browser is allowed to read and write to that location.
Once you confirm this, the import is performed and saved to the selected location in subdirectories per output method. A green banner at the bottom of the importer window confirms a successful import. A red banner reports any errors.
The workbench for document-based authoring
If you use document-based authoring, it does not matter if you work with Word documents on Sharepoint or Google Docs on Drive. The output of the AEM Importer is always docx file(s). Google Drive has an option to automatically convert the docx files (Settings > General > Convert uploads). When you upload the files to your drive, they will be converted automatically.
Check the "Convert uploaded files to Google Docs editor format" checkbox
AEM Authoring
Performing an initial import for AEM authoring using the Universal Editor is quite simple.
Provide a URL (https://wknd.site/us/en.html in our sample case) of a page to import.
Define your desired output.
Under Import Options, select Save as JCR package, if you are using AEM authoring.
If you select another option like Save raw HTML or Save as markdown, subdirectories are created in your selected destination for the various formats.
If you only select one option, no subdirectory is created.
Under Import Options, select Save as JCR package, if you are using AEM authoring.
If you select another option like Save raw HTML or Save as markdown, subdirectories are created in your selected destination for the various formats.
If you only select one option, no subdirectory is created.
Define your import paths.
Content Import Path defines where in your destination repository the content will be stored. This must be under /content.
Asset Import Path defines wherein your destination repository assets will be stored. This must be under /content/dam.
Content Import Path defines where in your destination repository the content will be stored. This must be under /content.
Asset Import Path defines wherein your destination repository assets will be stored. This must be under /content/dam.
Click the Import button.
The importer triggers the browser to ask you where you want to save the resulting JCR file and for confirmation that the browser is allowed to read and write to that location.
Once you confirm this, the import is performed and saved to the selected location in subdirectories per output method. A green banner at the bottom of the importer window confirms a successful import. A red banner reports any errors.
The workbench for AEM authoring
Where are my assets?
The importer creates binaryless JCR packages. I.e. they contain content only without any binaries. If you choose to import your content as a JCR package, your content is mapped within the package as per the Content Import Path you specified. The assets are also mapped as per the Asset Import Path, but are proxied via your local importer.
The import process also generates an asset-mapping.json file alongside your JCR package, which maps the actual assets to the proxied paths. Due to authorization limitations, these assets could not be downloaded directly as part of the import. However you can use the asset-mapping.json file and the AEM Import Helper app to download and import your assets
Import - Workbench – General Features
The Page preview frame at the bottom of the middle panel shows you the page you are importing. The page is loaded in an iframe and served via the local proxy server. While AEM tries to remove all security settings, it is possible that the page does not fully render like the original due to CORS issues. This is usually fine in 90% of the cases. In the remaining cases, there are different solutions that can be attempted such as starting your browser with disabled security settings. Please contact the AEM team for assistance in such cases.
The Preview tab in the right panel shows you an approximation of how the import will appear.
For document-based authoring, this is an approximation of the resulting Word document.
For AEM authoring, this is the JCR content based on the markdown and modeling.
The AEM Importer transforms the HTML into markdown as a first step and then the markdown into a docx file, HTML, or JCR repository depending on your selected authoring method. The Markdown tab shows you the markdown from that intermediate step.
Check the Markdown source
The HTML tab shows the result of the first step of the transformation. It is the result of the DOM manipulation. This tab can be occasionally useful but can be disregarded the majority of the time.
Check the HTML source
By default, the AEM Importer performs a few things for you automatically, like removing the head and cleaning up the HTML.
To further customize the import process, you can create a tools/importer/import.js file. This file defines all of your own rules to convert your content. If you change and save the import.js file, the import is automatically re-executed. In this way, you can preview your changes while you are developing the transformation rules.
It is highly recommended that you read the GitHub documentation for the importer to learn more and review code snippets to create your own import.js. Note that any rules you add to your own import.js file are in addition to the default behavior of the importer. Additional options for the import are also documented in detail there.
What do I do with these docx files/JCR package/HTML?
With a set of rules (such as to remove header and footer, reorganize the hero section, create blocks, insert metadata, etc.), you can create an import that contains the essential content of the page and that fits perfectly in a Word document, content package, or HTML depending on your authoring method. You can use this content as the base of your new site by:
Importing the docx into Google Drive or SharePoint or copying and pasting the content to start your site with document-based authoring.
Using AEM’s package manager or the AEM Import Helper tool to import the JCR package to start your site with AEM authoring and the Universal Editor.
Using Document Authoring’s Browse view, you can drag-and-drop the HTML content into DA.
Import - Bulk
Once you are satisfied with the transformation and you have individually tested one or more files, you likely will need to bulk import many more. The Import - Bulk tool works nearly the same as the Import - Workbench tool with a few minor differences.
Provide a list of URLs instead of one. Simply paste the list of URLs to import with one URL per line.
The import.js file is not automatically reloaded as it is for one-off imports since if you are in the middle of importing 1000 URLs, you probably do not want the process to restart if you change the code.
Otherwise the options are the same for importing one page or performing a bulk import.
The amount of URLs you can import varies mainly based on the memory each page consumes. For example, a heavy SPA page usually does not release memory and the browser tends to crash (between 60 and 100 pages). In such situations, if you only need information which is in the markup, you can disable Javascript execution in the options and you will be able to import many more pages.
You can still batch the set of URLs to import if the number is still manually manageable. If you have a lot of URLs to import (10k+), contact the AEM team. There are several ways to automate the process without using a browser, which you can discuss with them.
Report
During the process, you can download an Excel report with the list of pages imported and some process information (import success, 404, 301, etc.). At the end of the process, this report file contains everything the importer has done and can be used for further analysis such as to find pages with errors. Or it can be used for page processing such as previewing and publishing.
Bulk import
Crawl
If you are importing pages from a website and you do not have the full list of URLs to import, you can use the Crawl tool to build the list based on the sitemap or by crawling the site.
Get from robots.txt or sitemap
After providing a hostname and clicking Get from robots.txt or sitemap, the tool will first try to find sitemaps in the /robots.txt file. If no robots.txt is found, it will try the /sitemap.xml file (the default filename to search can be changed in the options).
If it finds a sitemap, it will collect all the URLs referenced in the siteamp and recursively follow the referenced other sitemap files. When the crawl is complete, you can use the download report button for the list of all unique URLs found.
Sitemaps extracted URLs
You can use the Filter pathname option to only output the URLs under a certain path. The tool will still need to fetch all the URLs from all the sitemaps.
Crawl
After providing a URL and clicking Crawl, the tool will open the provided URL, try to identify the links on the page, and recursively visit all those links that are on the same host. It is basically navigating the site and collecting all the URLs it finds. For a large website, it can take a lot of time. If the website consumes a lot of resources / memory, it may even crash the browser. In such cases, hiding the preview and/or disabling the Javascript in the options can help.
Crawling in-progress
You can use the Filter pathname option to only crawl URLs under a certain path. The provided URLs must then match this filter. This can be really useful to only crawl a subset of a large site.
Eyedropper
The Eyedropper tool allows you to capture the logo and some of the key CSS information of a website. You just need to provide a URL and click Eyedrop.
Captured logo
Captured colors
Captured fonts and sizes
Clicking the Copy CSS to clipboard button copies all gathered information in a CSS format that is ready to be pasted into your AEM CSS for further testing and customization.
The Eydropper does its best to extract the correct information, but you should review the output and adapt it to your project needs.

Getting Started – Document Authoring (DA) Developer Tutorial
This tutorial will get you up-and-running with a new Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) project. In ten to twenty minutes, you will have created your own site and be able to create, preview, and publish your own content, styling, and add new blocks.
Prerequisites:
You have a GitHub account, and understand Git basics.
You understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You have node / npm installed for local development.
This tutorial uses macOS, Chrome, and Visual Studio Code as the development environment and the screenshots and instructions reflect that setup. You can use a different operating system, browser, and code editor, but the UI you see and steps you must take may vary accordingly.
What makes Document Authoring different
Document Authoring (DA) is an alternative to SharePoint or Google Drive that provides a document-based authoring interface focused on the AEM Document model (Blocks, Sections, etc.). It provides an SDK, APIs, and built-in Adobe technologies.
Getting started
The fastest and easiest way to get started following AEM best practices is to create your repository using the AEM Block Collection GitHub repository as a template. You can find it here: https://github.com/aemsites/da-block-collection
Click the Use this template button and select Create a new repository, and select the user or org you would like to own this repository.
We recommend that the repository is set to public.
The only remaining step in GitHub is to install the AEM Code Sync GitHub App on your repository by visiting this link: https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync/installations/new. This app will sync code changes to AEM.
In the Repository access settings of the AEM Code Sync App, make sure you select Only select Repositories (not All Repositories). Then select your newly created repository, and click Save.
Note: If you are using Github Enterprise with IP filtering, you can add the following IP to the allow list: 3.227.118.73
Congratulations! You have a new website running on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/ In the example above that’s https://main--da-tutorial--da-sites.aem.page/
Link your code and content
Copy your GitHub repo URL. In our example, this would be: https://github.com/da-sites/da-tutorial
Paste this URL into the https://da.live/start page and click Go.
You will be presented with a code snippet to place in your project. Click Copy to add the code to your clipboard. You will then be walked through the process of adding the snippet to your fstab.yaml.
Note: Firefox users may have to select the snippet and copy manually.
Clicking Copy will present an Open button. This button will take you directly to your fstab.yaml to paste your snippet.
Upon landing back in GitHub, paste the code snippet and commit the changes. You can close the GitHub tab when you are finished committing your changes.
After you have committed your changes, switch back to your https://da.live/start tab and click Done.
You will be presented with the option to create demo content. This is recommended for this tutorial.
Browse your content
After your demo content has been copied, you will be taken to DA’s browse view. Here you can:
Browse your content
Search & replace content
Copy, rename, move, and delete content
Create new docs, sheets, and media
Access configurations for both DA and AEM.
Drag and drop supported files from your computer or mobile device.
Check out the demo page by clicking on it.
Edit and preview your content
One of the unique features of DA is the ability to get a live preview of your document. Click the preview tab to expand the live preview pane.
Once the live preview pane is open, change the document. Below, we have changed the congrats text. You will see your changes reflected in the preview pane on the right.
Preview your content from DA
In addition to the AEM Sidekick, DA provides the ability to preview and publish your content. Select the paper airplane in the top right of the page and click preview.
Your page will open in a new tab with your changes. You are now looking at a staged, or preview, version of your page.
Publish your content using AEM Sidekick
The next step is to publish the page using AEM Sidekick. If you have not already done so, install the AEM Sidekick Chrome extension.
After adding the extension to Chrome, don’t forget to pin it, this will make it easier to find it.
Navigate back to your previewed page and toggle the Sidekick extension to see Sidekick at the bottom of your page. Click the Publish button to push your page live.
Start developing styling and functionality
To get started with development, it is easiest to install the AEM Command Line Interface (CLI) and clone your repo locally through using the following.
From there change into your project folder and start your local development environment using the following.
This opens http://localhost:3000/ and you are ready to make changes.A good place to start is in the blocks folder which is where most of the styling and code lives for a project. Simply make a change in a .css or .js and you should see the changes in your browser immediately.
Once you are are ready to push your changes, simply use Git to add, commit, and push and your code to your preview (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/) and production (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live/) sites.
That’s it, you made it! Congrats, your first site is up and running. If you need help in the tutorial, please join our Discord channel or get in touch with us.

Adobe Experience Manager Assets Sidekick Plugin
With the Experience Manager Assets Sidekick plugin, you can use assets from your Experience Manager Assets repository while authoring documents in Microsoft Word or Google Docs.
Important Note: For using assets while authoring a page using Universal Editor based WYSIWYG authoring, please refer to Universal Editor Custom Asset Picker. The documentation here is specifically for document based authoring experience.
Supported Experience Manager Assets Versions
The Sidekick plugin for Assets supports access to:
Adobe Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service
Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials
Note: To simplify access to Experience Manager Assets version 6.5 (Adobe Managed Services or on-premises), you can implement a project-based plugin using the asset selector from version 6.5.
Grant Users Access to Assets
Content authors who need access to assets using the plugin, must be entitled to an Experience Manager Assets environment by assigning them to the respective product profile.
Please see Assigning AEM Product Profiles for details.
Assets Sidekick Plugin for Content Authors
Content authors can access assets from Experience Manager Assets without having to leave Microsoft Word or Google Docs.
Open up the Sidekick browser extension and find the “My Assets” button.
Note that the name of the button may vary depending on your project’s configuration.
Please see the document Configuring AEM Assets Sidekick Plugin to configure this plugin.

When hovering over assets, you will see the info icon, which shows additional asset metadata.
Selecting an asset copies it to your clipboard.
You can then paste the copied asset to your Microsoft Word or Google Doc document.
After using the Sidekick to preview and publish the document, the new asset is displayed as part of your web page
Note: Non-image assets like videos, PDF documents, zip files etc. cannot be copied to Word / Google Docs documents. To use such assets, the reference URL for those assets should be copied instead. For enabling this reference URL-based copying of the asset, please refer to the section Using Asset References for PDF, Zip, etc. when Authoring Content.
Delivering Assets via Dynamic Media with OpenAPI
Using the Assets Sidekick plugin, you can also include Dynamic Media delivery with OpenAPI. This offers a number of benefits.

Configuring Adobe Experience Manager Assets Sidekick Plugin
Learn how to configure the Adobe Experience Manager Assets Sidekick plugin, so you can use assets from your Experience Manager Assets repository while authoring documents in Microsoft Word or Google Docs.
Important Note: For using assets while authoring a page using Universal Editor based WYSIWYG authoring, please refer to Universal Editor Custom Asset Picker. The documentation here is specifically for document based authoring experience.
For information on the authoring experience while using the Sidekick plugin, please see Adobe Experience Manager Assets Sidekick Plugin.
Note: Using non-image assets such as Videos and PDF documents is in an Early Adopter program. Find more details here.
Configure Your Sidekick
To enable the Assets plugin in your Sidekick, you must create a configuration in your project’s GitHub.
Open your project in GitHub and locate the Sidekick configuration file at tools/sidekick/config.json.
If the file does not yet exist, create it.
For more details, please refer to this document on extending AEM Sidekick.
If the file does not yet exist, create it.
For more details, please refer to this document on extending AEM Sidekick.
In your config.json file, you must add an asset-library section.
You can either add the asset-library section to your existing configuration, or replace your configuration with the example provided.
Please note that you should provide a title for the plugin that website authors will understand (“My Assets” in the example).
You can either add the asset-library section to your existing configuration, or replace your configuration with the example provided.
Please note that you should provide a title for the plugin that website authors will understand (“My Assets” in the example).
Commit the configuration to your project's Github repo.
Open up the AEM sidekick in a Microsoft Word or Google Doc project document. You should see the My Assets button. The label of the button will depend on your configuration.
Advanced Configurations
You can optionally customize the Assets Sidekick plugin by specifying query parameters in the asset selector URL in the Sidekick config.json file. The following parameters are supported:
rail (optional)
Permissible Values: true/false
Use this parameter to toggle the rail view of the asset selector. By default, the rail view is used, which is more compact and offers search-only experience. If you set the parameter to ?rail=false, a tree view left panel is shown with the repository folder hierarchy allowing users to browse for assets in addition to searching.
Please note that the folder hierarchy view occupies additional screen space. To accommodate it, you may have to increase the width of the asset selector panel.
The Asset Selector component leverages micro-frontend Asset Selector that is instrumented to integrate with Sidekick. To learn more, please see the Micro-Frontend Asset Selector documentation.
extConfigUrl (optional)
Use this parameter to extend the Assets Sidekick by specifying the complete URL where the configuration is hosted. This is useful for scenarios where the configuration resides at a different location than the project's domain. To configure extConfigUrl, include it in the sidekick JSON configuration of the extension.
Ensure that the URL supplied in parameter extConfigUrl , is accessible and that cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is enabled for the domain experience.adobe.com.
If the configuration is hosted on an Edge Delivery Services project, refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on configuring CORS for hosted configurations.
Extension Points
You can customize the AEM Assets Sidekick plugin using extension points to meet your custom requirements. These extension points enhance the plugin's functionality and adapt it to your organization's unique demands.
This section details the extension points available and provides example configurations. See the following section, Configure Extension Points, for details on how to implement the extensions.
blockName
This extension point defines the block name for different MIME types.
Example Configuration (Video Type Assets):
This configuration allows users to change the Block Name for Video type assets from default “Embed” to “Core Embed”.
copyMode
This extension point defines the copy mode for different MIME types.
Example Configuration (Image Type Assets):
This configuration enables users to pick images from the Assets Selector as a link when pasting it into a Word document.
Note: Once the config is enabled, you’d also need to ensure appropriate handling in your site’s front-end code to convert such image links to <picture/> tag with appropriate srcset. Find more details here.
blockTemplate
This extension point defines the template structure used for displaying video blocks, allowing flexibility in the structure of the block that gets copied to the Word document to align it with the block structures used in your site authoring.
Example Configuration (Video Type Assets):
The following example demonstrates how to configure the blockTemplate for video assets:
This configuration would result in a block like the following example copied to the Word document when the asset is pasted. It has the poster image and the video URL and the block’s header row has been styled.
Variables Used:
blockName: Represents the name of the video block
posterUrl: Contains the URL of the image that serves as the video poster or thumbnail
name: Denotes the name of the video asset
videoUrl: Provides the public delivery URL of the video file
filterSchema
This extension point allows you to set up custom search filters to make it easier to find and narrow down assets based on its metadata, such as tags, status, type etc.
Example Configuration (Adding Tag Picker to Rail Filter Schema):
This configuration allows users to fetch the taxonomy from AEM and pick and apply tags from that AEM taxonomy to filter the assets.
The name attribute should be changed depending on the repository.
For the delivery repository: property=metadata.application.xcm:keywords.id
For the authors: property=xcm:keywords.id=
assetDomainMapping
This extension point defines domain mappings, allowing domains to be replaced per your configuration. If a domain mapping doesn’t exist, the original delivery URL is retained.
Example Configuration (Asset Domain mappings):
This configuration replaces any delivery domain with its corresponding CDN-mapped or custom domain.
Configure Extension Points
Customization of the Assets Sidekick plugin including its extension points is done by the sidekick’s project configuration file. There are two options for defining this configuration file:
Option 1: Host Configuration in the Same Project
In this option, the configuration file should be defined at the following path within your Edge Delivery Services project:
/tools/assets-selector/config.json
Additionally, ensure that the Assets Sidekick Plugin configuration includes the following parameter set to true:
passConfig=true
This configuration is the same as described in the section Configure Your Sidekick.
Option 2: Host Configuration Externally and Pass It to the Assets Sidekick Plugin
You can host the configuration file at any accessible URL and pass it to the Assets Sidekick plugin. You do this by utilizing the extConfigUrl parameter to specify the URL from which the configuration will be fetched. This configuration is the same as described in the section Advanced Configuration.
Configuration Based on Page Context
The configuration can take a page’s URL as a parameter, allowing you to generate the configuration on the fly based on the page’s context. This enables the Assets Selector to use the page context when suggesting relevant assets. By doing so, you can set up configurations dynamically in the Assets Selector based on the context (the page URL) passed to it
This is particularly useful for scenarios where you want page authors to be shown only a subset of assets from your assets repository based on the context of the web page they are authoring such as showing locale or region-specific assets based on the locale of the page authored.
To implement this, follow these steps:
Ensure the Sidekick configuration has both passReferrer and passConfig flags set to true.
Host a configuration that can be served by the following endpoint:
https://<your-config-server>/config.json?webPath=<page-path>
Here, page-path is the URL of the page being edited in the Word or Google Doc document, and the Assets Selector should launch in the context of that page-path. This endpoint should serve the complete configuration. It is expected that you implement the necessary server side logic at this endpoint to serve the configuration based on the provided context (the webPath) in the specified format accepted by the asset selector
For example, the endpoint can look at the webPath and return a configuration which uses the page’s tags at that webPath, to set the default tags in the Tag Picker filter of the Assets Selector. In this way, the Assets Selector launches with those default tags applied, showing relevant assets based on the page's context.
Sample Configuration for Reference:
For more detail and reference configurations, please see the readme of the Assets Selector to help you adapt and deploy these configurations in your project based on your use cases and extension requirements.

Bring Your Own Git
Edge Delivery Services recommends using GitHub or GitHub Enterprise Cloud to host and deploy project code for frictionless adoption and seamless integration. If you are already an AEM customer and your organization is unable to use GitHub for the source code, you can now use Cloud Manager as an intermediary and configure your own git based repository service there.
The following git based repository vendors are currently supported via Cloud Manager:
GitHub Enterprise (self-hosted version only)
BitBucket (cloud version only)
GitLab (cloud and self-hosted version)
We’re currently supporting additional vendors in an Alpha phase. To enable support for them, contact us at cloudmanager_byog@adobe.com
Azure DevOps (cloud version only)
Adobe Hosted Repository (via Cloud Manager)
Note: Edge Delivery Services expects a main branch to be present in your repository for production code.
1. Prepare your Edge Delivery Services Site
Before you can configure your external repository, you need to have an aem.live org registered in the configuration service and have an admin user who can perform updates to the site configuration. An easy way to get started is to follow the developer tutorial. Once your site is up and running, contact an Adobe representative to create the aem.live org for you and add the administrative user(s).
Please note: even if you don’t use github.com as the source repository, the name of the aem.live org still needs to exist as a github.com org controlled by you. This ensures that nobody can (ab)use the same organization name.
2. Configure your External Repository in Cloud Manager
As a first step, configure your external repository in Cloud Manager. If you are new to AEM, see here for an introduction and to find out how to access Cloud Manager.
Once the repository ownership is confirmed and the status is set to ready, you will need to set up a webhook for your git repository. This will allow Cloud Manager to receive push event notifications whenever changes are made to your repository. You can find the webhook details in Cloud Manager, and they are unique for each repository.
The webhook requires an API key, which is the same key used for interacting with any Cloud Manager API. For more details on generating the Cloud Manager public API key, refer to the public documentation. Additionally, a webhook secret must be configured in your git vendor solution when creating the webhook. This secret will be used to sign each event sent to Cloud Manager.
If your git repository is not publicly accessible, you can request a list of IPs used by Cloud Manager. To do this, send an email to cloudmanager_byog@adobe.com from the email address associated with your Adobe ID. Be sure to specify which Git platform you want to use and whether you are using a private, public, or enterprise repository structure.
3. Configure your Edge Delivery Site in Cloud Manager
Once you have your aem.live site, you need to onboard it into Cloud Manager and validate its ownership. For more details, please refer to the Cloud Manager public documentation.
Once you select the "Bring your own Git" option, a pop-up window will appear prompting you to choose the repository you wish to use as the source code for the site.
Once the repository is selected, Cloud Manager will provide a secret that must be added in your site configuration. Be sure to copy the secret and store it securely, as it won't be visible again in Cloud Manager. If you reconfigure the site, Cloud Manager will generate a new secret.
4. Configure your AEM Site to use Cloud Manager
Next, you need to add the code repository to your site configuration. If you are new to Edge Delivery Services, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the Admin API.
You will need to replace <org> and <site> with your actual values from the configuration service, and <program-id> and <repository-id> with the actual values from Cloud Manager. The latter details can be easily found in the “Configure Webhook” section of the repository.
You also need to create a secret named "cm-byog" using the Admin API. The value of this secret should be the one provided by Cloud Manager in the previous step.
5. Trigger your first sync
In Cloud Manager, select the "Sync Code" option from your site's dropdown menu.
In the popup that appears, choose the branch you wish to sync.
This action will update your Edge Delivery Site with the code from your private git repository and the selected branch. For more details about the sync jobs, you can use the following Admin API.
6. Verify your AEM Site
Browse your site at https://main–{site}--{org}.aem.pageto ensure the initial synchronization from your external repository has worked as expected.
To test continuous code synchronization, make a change to one of your code files (ideally something easy to spot in the browser) and push it to the main branch of your external repository and ensure the change is reflected on your AEM Site.
Note: Code synchronization happens asynchronously and your changes may not be reflected immediately. Disable your browser cache or use an incognito window for testing to circumvent your browser’s cache and force it to fetch all resources from the server.

Exploring blocks
Introduction
Blocks are a foundational concept behind adding form and function to sections of a page. If you followed along with the tutorial, you will know that you can create simple content structures with just text and images. When you want to group pieces of content, add a bit more structure, or add more complex functionality, blocks can help you achieve these goals.
Example blocks ideas
A block can really be anything you choose, but here are a few possible use cases:
Hero
Navigation
Accordion
Carousel
Tab List
How they work
Blocks are built using tables in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. These tables are converted to Markdown and rendered as simple divs when requesting HTML.
To create a block, you only need a table with at least one row & one column:
This will output in HTML as:
In order to give some context to our block, we will add a name to the first row + column:
This will output in HTML as:
We now have a CSS class that we can use to either style our block or attach functionality with Javascript. Of course, an empty div with a class is not tremendously useful.
Let’s add a bit of content using additional rows and columns:
Each accordion item will have a header with an image and text sitting below. I could have made this content a little simpler by joining the image and text columns, but I want to highlight a few important areas with how the HTML is rendered from this table. Let’s look at the markup:
As we saw before, we have a div with a class representing the entire table. There are a few other notable additions:
Every row after the first is represented by a div (Line 2).
Every column is also represented by a div (Line 7).
If you have multiple columns, but have merged cells, you will get an empty div (Line 4).
Once you have created this structure in your document, you will want to decorate and style it.
Decorating blocks
The concept of decorating blocks is to perform several optional tasks:
Add additional classes or IDs to your markup.
Add any semantic elements you may want.
Add any aria or accessibility attributes you need.
Manipulate the DOM in a way to match your desired output.
For our use case, we’ll decorate the block to add a few classes to help with styling and add an event handler for interactivity:(Copy the following code to blocks/accordion/accordion.js)
Let’s also add some CSS:(Copy the following code to blocks/accordion/accordion.css)
The end result should look something a bit like this:
Conclusion
And that’s it! You’ve taken a simple table in Docs or Word and made it a much more rich experience for your visitors.

https://www.aem.live/developer/web-components

Web Components
Web Components are a collection of web standards that allow the creation and use of reusable, modular functionality in web sites and web apps. They can be used in Adobe Experience Manager projects.
Concepts and usage
There are three distinct web standards that make up Web Components. In order of relevance for AEM projects, these are:
Custom elements allow the use of custom behavior and functionality in your existing site
HTML templates enable the creation of DOM elements that are not displayed in the page
Shadow DOM isolates a branch of the DOM tree from its parent, enabling re-use across a wide range of sites
Depending on how Web Components are written, their code and styles can be largely isolated from the rest of the page, which allows custom elements written by different teams to coexist on the same page, as well as sharing components between independent projects or teams.
They are often used for design systems in large organizations, but can also provide useful functionality such as dynamic loading of content, data retrieval from third-party sources, client-side content processing, etc.
How to use Web Components in AEM projects?
To activate a Web Component, you need to load the JavaScript code that defines it and have your AEM blocks code generate the corresponding custom HTML elements.
The code loading is similar to adding any existing JavaScript/CSS code to your project, but please read the “performance concerns” section below to avoid surprises.
Example: page publication time
The following paragraph uses a publication-time AEM block that leverages GitHub’s relative-time Web Component to display the page publication time in a friendly format:
This page was published 14/07/2025
This would typically be used in the website footer if you want to indicate when each page was last published.
Reusing existing code makes total sense to compute friendly relative time strings like “two days ago”, “five hours ago”, so a Web Component is helpful, as our publication-time AEM block only needs to output something like:
To let the relative-time Web Component do all the (somewhat) hard work.
From a coding standpoint, we only need to make the relative-time component code available and write the pretty simple glue code in the AEM publication-time block.
Performance concerns, loading and lifecycle
To keep your Web Performance at the required level, your pages need to be frugal about how much JavaScript and CSS code they load, and if needed control when that loading occurs.
If your Web Components are written with performance in mind, there’s no reason for them to be less performant than AEM blocks, which are also backed by client-side JavaScript. Unfortunately, this cannot be taken for granted and you should test the performance of any Web Component before using it.
The AEM blocks code needs to translate the AEM semantic HTML to generate the custom HTML elements, but that’s no different from generating other HTML elements, so shouldn’t significantly affect performance.
If you want to use components from an existing library, you should make sure to load only JavaScript and CSS code that the current page actually requires, to avoid any extra baggage. Some libraries do that naturally, and others will require jumping through hoops to repackage their components in an optimized way. Your mileage may vary, and as always you’ll need to measure results to verify that the components code does not hamper performance.
You also need to be aware of the AEM Three-Phase-Loading principle, and if needed explicitly define when your Web Components code and styles are loaded.
One nice feature of Web Components that helps with lazy loading is that they take care of the asynchronicity and lifecycle concerns. Provided your components use the lifecycle callbacks in the correct way, it does not matter whether their code becomes active before or after the corresponding elements are added to the DOM, the browser does the right thing.

Configuring Adobe Target Integration
This article will walk you through the steps of setting up an integration with Adobe Target so you can personalize your pages via the Adobe Target Visual Experience Composer (VEC). Before you go further, please also check our native Experimentation capabilities.
We support 2 different ways of integrating with Adobe Target. The recommended future-proof approach is via the Adobe Experience Platform WebSDK, but we also support the legacy Adobe Target at.js approach.
Considerations
Before we dive into the technical implementations, let us quickly recap how Adobe Target works so we set the proper expectations.
Adobe Target lets you modify the content of an existing page based on the personalization parameters you define in Adobe Target Visual Experience Composer (VEC) or equivalent. The rules will be dynamically evaluated server-side and Adobe Target will deliver a list of page modifications that will be applied to the rendered page after the blocks have been decorated.
There are thus a few things to keep in mind:
Page modifications are done on the final page markup after the blocks have been decorated. So if you want to change block behaviors based on modifications that Adobe Target will be doing (like setting a CSS class or attribute), you’ll have to leverage the MutationObserver API
Adobe Target will be modifying blocks after they have been decorated and shown on the page. In most cases, this is not an issue as applying the modifications takes only a few milliseconds, but if you run complex code snippets this will likely trigger some page flickering and impact the user experience
The roundtrip to the Adobe Target backend services to obtain the list of page modifications that need to be applied is done during the eager phase and will impact the overall LCP. The first call to the endpoint is also typically slower, while subsequent calls will be on a warmed-up service with cached responses
Since the instrumentation has an overhead, we recommend only enabling it on selected pages that are meant to be experimented on or personalized. The easiest is to add a page metadata, like Target: on that will act as a feature flag.
In our tests, you can expect a baseline performance impact as below. To this you’d also need to add the overhead of more complex page modifications, especially when using custom JavaScript snippets.
Mobile
Desktop
Adobe Experience Platform WebSDK
To enable Adobe Target integration in your website using the Adobe Experience Platform WebSDK (aka alloy), please follow these steps in your project:
Start by following the steps to Use Adobe Target and Web SDK for personalization, and skip all steps related to actual instrumentation at the code level
Make sure to note down the Adobe IMS Organization Identifier (orgId) as well as the Adobe Experience Platform Datastream Id (datastreamId, formally edgeConfigId) you want to use. You can get those following the WebSDK configuration documentation (orgId, edgeConfigId).
In your GitHub repository for the website, add the alloy.js file.
Then edit your scripts.js file and add the following code somewhere above the loadEager method definition:
Adjust the path to the library and set the correct values for your datastreamId, formally edgeConfigId, and orgId as per step 2.
Then edit the loadEager method to:
Commit and push your code
Setup up an experiment in Adobe Target and preview the page
Add the Target metadata property to your page to trigger the instrumentation, or adjust the getMetadata condition in the code above to your needs. You can typically import getMetadata from aem.js or equivalent in your project if it isn’t yet available in your scripts.js
If the instrumentation is properly done, you should see a call to https://edge.adobedc.net/ee/v1/interact in your browser’s Network tab when you load the page. Whether the page is actually modified or not will depend on the configuration you set in Adobe Target
You are all done!
Adobe Target at.js (legacy)
To enable Adobe Target integration in your website using the legacy at.js approach, please follow these steps in your project:
Start by reading the Adobe Target at.js implementation documentation, and skip all steps related to actual instrumentation at the code level
Go to https://experience.adobe.com/#/target/setup/implementation and note down your Client Code and IMS Organization Id
In your GitHub repository for the website, add the at.js file. We have an optimized version for AEM Edge Delivery Service that you can fetch at https://atjs--wknd--hlxsites.hlx.live/scripts/at.fix.min.js until it is made publicly available
Then Edit your scripts.js file and add the following code somewhere above the loadEager method definition:
Adjust the path to the library and set the correct values for the clientCode and imsOrgId as per step 2, and edit the serverDomain so the first part matches your client code.
Then edit the loadEager method to:
Commit your code
Setup up an experiment in Adobe Target and preview the page
Add the Target metadata property to your page to trigger the instrumentation, or adjust the getMetadata condition in the code above to your needs. You can typically import getMetadata from aem.js or equivalent in your project if it isn’t yet available in your scripts.js
If the instrumentation is properly done, you should see a call to https://<client-code>.tt.omtrdc.net/rest/v1/delivery in your browser’s Network tab when you load the page. Whether the page is actually modified or not will depend on the configuration you set in Adobe Target
You are all done!

https://www.aem.live/docs/experimentation

Experimentation
Experimentation is the practice of making your site more effective by changing content or functionality, comparing the results with the prior version, and picking the improvements that have measurable effects.
When done right, it is a powerful pattern to improve conversions, engagement, and visitor experience. There are three main pitfalls to avoid when looking to adopt the practice:
Too little: most companies are not experimenting enough, and when they do, they experiment with too little traffic to get meaningful results.
Too slow: many experimentation frameworks slow the site down so much that the potential new conversions can’t make up for the lost traffic and bounces due to slow rendering
Too complex: if it takes too much time to set up a new experiment, then fewer experiments will be run.
For sites running on Adobe Experience Manager, there is the experimentation plugin that allows developers to add an experimentation capability to their sites. Three things make this approach different:
It’s easy to set up tests in the tools your authors are already familiar with, no separate login is needed
It’s deeply integrated into the AEM delivery system, does not slow down your site and is resilient to changes in code and content
It allows testing simple content changes as well as experiments covering design, functionality, and code
Follow the rest of this guide to set up your first experiment. There are a few terms that you will find used repeatedly:
Control: the experience prior to running the experiment. Any experiment tries to prove an improvement over the control experience.
Challenger: an experience that differs from the control experience and that may or may not have better results such as conversions
Variants: control and challenger are all variants of an experiment
Significance: is your challenger really better than the control or is this just luck? Calculating significance allows you to rule out luck and concentrate on results that have a real effect
Experiment Variants
Experiment variants are the easiest way to get started with experimentation. This approach uses the page you already have as the control, you then create a challenger page that will replace the control for some of your visitors. In your challenger page, you can test different variants of your hero blocks, different page layout or call-to-action (CTA) placements and verbiage.
As long as you stay within the established design language of your website and use existing block functionality you should be able to set up an experiment variant and send it to production in a matter of a few minutes using your established authoring tools.
Experiment Identifier
Every experiment should have its own identifier for tracking and analytics purposes.A good starting point is to come up with a good, unique identifier for your experiment, called the “Experiment ID”.Experiments are often numbered linearly or correlated to their Issue ID in an issue tracker or management system that is used. Experiment IDs often use a prefix for the project. Examples are OPT-0134, EXP0004 or CCX0076.
Create your Challenger Page
By convention it is recommended to create a folder with a lowercase experiment ID in your /experiments/ folder (for example /experiments/ccx0076/) which is where all the pages for your challenger variants live.
Your experiments folder will look something like this:
Once the folder has been created, put a copy of your control page into that folder, and apply the changes on the page that you would like to test as part of your experiment variant. As an example let’s assume we have the following page on the website that we want to run an experiment on.
Your copy of the challenger placed in the experiments/<experiment-id> folder might look like this:
Preview and publish the challenger page using the sidekick and when you are done authoring the challenger page, the URL of the published challenger will be used in the next section - setting up the experiment.
Set up your Experiment
As soon as you have your challengers ready to go, all you need to do is to go back to the control page and add some metadata indicating that this page is now part of a test.
There are two metadata rows that need to be added for an experiment variant.
Experiment : containing your experiment ID
Experiment Variants: containing URLs for all the challengers of this page, separated by line breaks if you have more than one challenger
See example below:
For an experiment variant the traffic split between all the variants (control + challengers) is automatically set to an even distribution. If you have one challenger, there will automatically be an even 50/50 split between control and the challenger. If you have 2 challengers, you will automatically see a third of the traffic allocated to control and each challenger and so on.
You can override the traffic split via metadata. For more information, see https://github.com/adobe/aem-experience-decisioning/wiki/Experiments#authoring
Preview and Stage your Experiment Variants
As soon as you are ready to preview and stage your experiment you can preview the control page with the additional metadata. Whenever you are previewing a page that has a running experiment, you will see the experimentation overlay in your .hlx.page preview environment that lets you switch between the variants and gives you confidence that your test is setup correctly and ready to be launched.
Authors can get quick insights on the performance of experiments being run on the production site. These insights are helpful in making a decision about the duration of the experiment, but also about which variant is best suited for production.
The data collection to measure the effectiveness of each variant is based on Real User Monitoring.
Send your Experiment Variant to Production
To send your experiment to production and collect data about the performance of each variant, the only step left is to publish the control page as well as each of the challenger pages.
Running Experiment Variants on Multiple Pages
Some experiments include changes across multiple pages. If you would like to run experiments across multiple pages, all you need to make sure is to use the same experiment ID in metadata across multiple pages and in case you have multiple challengers, make sure that your challenger URLs in the Experiment Variants metadata field are sequenced corresponding to their challengers across pages.
Make sure Experiment Variants are not indexed
When running experiments, it is usually best practice to exclude the variants from the sitemap and ensure they are not indexed by search engines, as the page could be seen as duplicate content and negatively impact SEO.
This can be achieved by either of the following 2 methods:
If you centralize all experiments in a dedicated folder, like /experiments: make sure your bulk metadata.xlsx sheet contains a row with /experiments/** as path, and a robots column with the value noindex,nofollow.
If you keep the experiment control and variants with the regular content: add a robots entry in the page metadata for each variant, with the value noindex,nofollow.

Why I don’t recommend UI testing in AEM (even though I write tests for my own projects)
When customers or partners ask me, “Should we write UI tests for our AEM projects?”, I usually say, “No, probably not.” But here’s the twist: when I’m working on something like Optel Explorer or AEM Sidekick, I write extensive tests.
Sounds contradictory, right?
It’s not. It’s all about understanding the cost-benefit trade-off of testing and most importantly, knowing why we test in the first place.
Let’s start with the basics: Why do we test?
Testing isn’t glamorous but it’s the quiet force behind fast releases, fewer bugs, and happier users. We don’t test just to tick a box; we test to gain confidence. Confidence that our code works, that we can ship faster and that users won’t hit broken experiences in production.
But testing comes at a cost: time, complexity, maintenance, and infrastructure. So the real question becomes: Is the benefit of testing worth the cost in this context?
Think of testing like insurance. You don’t insure everything—you insure what’s valuable and vulnerable. Similarly, in software, we should test where the impact of failure is high and the cost of testing is low.
Let’s bring this to life with two contrasting examples.
Scenario 1: Backend Utility Library
Imagine you're building a backend library that’s used across multiple services. If something breaks here, the consequences are serious. A single bug could ripple across dozens of features. Fortunately, testing this kind of logic is straightforward. It can be done in isolation, without any UI, using fast and reliable unit tests. Since the logic doesn’t change often, the tests remain stable and require minimal upkeep.
In this case, the value of testing is high, and the cost is low. It’s a no-brainer; definitely worth the effort.
Scenario 2: UI Testing in AEM
Now picture writing UI tests for a visual component in AEM. A misaligned button or a slightly off layout might be annoying, but it rarely breaks the user experience. Setting up automated UI tests, however, is anything but simple. Frameworks like Playwright or Web Test Runner require significant setup, and the tests themselves are fragile - small, unrelated changes can cause them to fail. Maintaining them becomes a chore.
Here, the value is low, and the cost is high. In most cases, it’s just not worth it.
Why Any CMS Makes UI Testing Even Harder
Content Management Systems (CMSs) are designed for flexibility, not predictability and that’s exactly what makes UI testing in these environments so challenging.
Components are rendered dynamically based on authored content, which can vary wildly. Different authors structure pages differently, introducing inconsistencies that automated tests struggle with. What works locally might fail in CI/CD due to rendering differences or timing issues. And DOM structures change often due to styling or layout updates, breaking tests even when functionality is intact.
Unless you’re testing a critical user flow like login, checkout, or form submission - UI tests in CMS environments often become more of a maintenance burden than a quality safeguard.
So, should you test in AEM?
Yes, but strategically.
Focus your efforts on areas that carry real weight: backend logic, reusable libraries, critical user journeys like login or checkout, and integrations that tie systems together. These are the pillars of your application’s reliability.
On the other hand, let go of the urge to validate every pixel. Visual tweaks on content-heavy pages, components that shift frequently, or purely aesthetic elements rarely justify the overhead. They tend to break often, demand constant updates, and offer little in return.
Final Thought: Test with Purpose, Not by Habit
Testing isn’t a ritual. It’s a strategic decision. That’s why I write tests for my other projects but still advise others to think twice for writing tests in AEM. Because I know exactly what I’m validating, why it matters, and what I’m prepared to maintain. I’m not chasing perfection, I’m investing in stability where it counts.
In the world of Content Management Systems, where the UI is dynamic, content-driven, and constantly evolving, the cost of exhaustive UI testing often outweighs the value it brings. So instead of testing everything, focus on what truly matters.Think in terms of impact versus effort. Validate what’s stable, critical, and cost-effective. Let go of what’s fragile, cosmetic, or constantly shifting.
That’s how you build AEM solutions that are not only reliable but agile, efficient, and future-proof.

↑↑↓↓←→←→ B A START: The Konami Code for Dynamic Publishing at Scale
Last week spelled deprecation for folder mapping. This week, two developers showed us what rises from its ashes.
Between them, Eric Van Geem and Lars Auffarth published 13,000 pages dynamically. No manual authoring. No static builds. Just pure, automated content delivery at scale through Edge Delivery's new BYOM and content overlay capabilities.
The cabinet hums with electricity. Neon pixels spell out "CHOOSE YOUR FIGHTER" as two champions materialize on screen. This isn't Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It's the Edge Delivery Services arena, where developers battle the final boss: dynamic publishing at massive scale.
CHOOSE YOUR FIGHTER
[PLAYER 1] THE AZURE ARCHITECTName: Eric Van GeemClass: Cloud Infrastructure WarriorPower Level: 10,000 profile pagesHome Stage: Azure Data CentersSpecial Move: Cosmos DB Trigger Combo
[PLAYER 2] THE APP BUILDER MAGEName: Lars AuffarthClass: Serverless SorcererPower Level: 3,000 product pagesAffiliation: Adobe AllianceUltimate Attack: Edge Worker Price Strike
Round 1: The Azure Architect's Combo
Eric opens with a devastating infrastructure combo. His Azure Cosmos DB stores 10,000 fighter profiles, each one waiting to enter the arena. The combo sequence: Cosmos DB Change Feed → Azure Function Trigger → Service Bus Queue → Timer Function → Helix Admin API → Vercel Overlay Server. When a profile updates in the database, his automated pipeline springs to life, throttling requests to respect API limits while maintaining relentless pressure on the content delivery boss.
His secret weapon? A Node.js Express server deployed on Vercel that acts as the overlay endpoint. When Edge Delivery requests /people/marty-mcfly, Eric's server fetches the data, merges it with a template, and returns pixel-perfect HTML. No manual intervention. No content duplication. Just pure, automated publishing fury.
Round 2: The App Builder Mage's Spellcast
Lars counters with native Adobe magic. His App Builder actions orchestrate a symphony of serverless functions. The spell components: Commerce API Webhook → App Builder Orchestrator → BYOM Renderer → Edge Worker Price Injection. Three thousand product pages dance to his command, each one updating automatically when backend data shifts.
His finishing move deploys edge workers that inject live pricing after page load—a technique so advanced it bends the rules of static delivery. While Eric's approach handles everything at publish time, Lars splits the attack: static content from BYOM, dynamic pricing from the edge. The boss never sees it coming.
Co-op Mode Unlocked: Convergent Evolution
Here's where the game gets interesting. Despite choosing different characters and tech stacks, both players discovered the same hidden mechanics. They mastered the template pattern, using HTML templates with placeholder replacement to transform data into pages. They both configured content overlays in Edge Delivery's config, unlocking the secret passage to dynamic publishing. They learned the 404 wisdom—returning proper 404s for missing content instead of taking soft 404 boss damage. They respected the semantic block architecture, generating Edge Delivery-compatible markup that flows through the same rendering pipeline. And perhaps most importantly, they achieved total automation, eliminating manual publishing entirely.
They're not competing. They're playing co-op mode against the same boss: the tyranny of manual content management at scale.
Loading Screen Tip: Master Your Own Moveset
But every fighter has unique abilities. Eric's Azure style gives him a self-hosted overlay server for maximum control. He can show visual proof of his victories with live sitemap.xml and query-index.json files. His architecture stays simpler for non-Adobe environments, with direct database integration patterns that any cloud warrior can understand.
Lars's App Builder technique plays differently. He wields zero infrastructure management through true serverless power. Native Adobe authentication and identity flow through his combos naturally. His event-driven orchestration creates richer attack patterns, while his split rendering strategy divides static and dynamic content like a master tactician.
Here's the secret: don't just memorize their button combos. Study how Eric leveraged his Azure expertise. Notice how Lars maximized Adobe's native capabilities. The best architects don't carbon copy moves—they understand the underlying mechanics and craft their own fighting style. Maybe you're a Google Cloud Platform warrior with Cloud Functions and Firestore ready to strike. Perhaps you're a Cloudflare champion with edge compute mastery. Your unique strengths are your special moves.
The Hidden Connection: Last Week's Update
These championship rounds wouldn't be possible without last week's game update by Farhan. When folder mapping got deprecated, it opened the door for Content Overlays and BYOM to become the new meta. These tools delivered what folder mapping promised but couldn't achieve: true dynamic publishing with proper SEO, hard 404s, and unlimited scale.
Game Over? Not Even Close
Thirteen thousand pages published. Two completely different approaches. One incredible community.
Eric showed us that BYOM works brilliantly with any cloud infrastructure. Lars proved that Adobe's own tools can orchestrate publishing symphonies. They built real systems that handle real scale, and shared every detail so you can too.
[INSERT COIN TO CONTINUE]
Ready to study their techniques? Eric's full walkthrough includes Azure setup, Vercel deployment, and live examples. Lars's strategy guide covers App Builder patterns, edge worker integration, and enterprise scaling.

The One Template That Broke the Internet (And My Heart)
I fell in love with folder mapping when it solved an impossible problem: serving 5,000+ dynamic stock pages with one elegant template. No more managing thousands of individual pages. No more content duplication nightmares. Just pure operational efficiency—deploy changes instantly across your entire collection by modifying one file.
But folder mapping betrayed me. Google Search Console started reporting hundreds of phantom pages as valid content when they were actually errors. Search results displayed generic template titles instead of real content. Crawl budgets disappeared into soft 404 black holes. The solution I'd loved was systematically sabotaging the SEO performance it was meant to support.
Then I discovered something better. Content overlay with the API for Edge Delivery Services delivers folder mapping's promises without its compromises—pre-published dynamic pages that exist when they claim to exist, proper 404 responses for invalid requests, and search engines that can actually crawl and index your content correctly.
Keep reading if you want to learn from my mistakes and understand how we deprecate and replace folder mapping.
What Worked Well
We designed folder mapping to address a fundamental challenge in content management: efficiently serving thousands of pages without requiring authors to create physical pages and maintain each one individually. The solution was elegantly simple—use a single template that dynamically populated content at runtime based on URL paths.
Folder mapping did address immediate operational concerns. Authors no longer needed to create duplicate templates or manually manage thousands of similar pages. A financial website, for instance, could serve thousands of stock pages using one carefully crafted template that fetched real-time data for each requested stock symbol. The efficiency gains were substantial: content authors could deploy changes instantly across their entire dynamic page collection by modifying just one template, ensuring consistent design and reduced maintenance overhead.
These use cases are relevant and valid. The operational benefits folder mapping delivered were real and significant for teams managing large-scale dynamic content.
Where Folder Mapping Fell Short (And Why We're Deprecating It)
As implementations scaled in production environments, we discovered that the map is not the territory. Folder mapping's elegant conceptual model—one template serves all pages—broke down when it encountered the harsh realities of web architecture. The two critical failings emerged: phantom pages being classified as valid content by search engines, and search results displaying generic template titles instead of actual content.
Soft 404 Violations
When users accessed invalid URLs, the system would load the template successfully, then use client-side JavaScript to verify content existence. Invalid requests displayed 404 messaging but returned 200 OK status codes—a fundamental violation of HTTP protocol. At one customer site, Google Search Console reported over 400 phantom pages as valid content when they were actually error states.
Search Engine Confusion
Search results began displaying generic template titles like "Default" instead of dynamic content titles. Combined with soft 404 issues, this created a crawl budget efficiency problem—search engines consumed resources processing thousands of pages with incomplete content, leaving less capacity for indexing valuable pages.
The Stakes
These weren't minor technical inconveniences. They were actively sabotaging the SEO performance folder mapping was meant to support. Every soft 404 misled search engines about content availability. Every generic title reduced click-through rates from search results. The solution was systematically undermining the success of the sites it powered.
Moving On From Folder Mapping with Content Overlays
Folder mapping is now deprecated due to the fundamental SEO and architectural issues outlined above. The core problem was that folder mapping stitched content together at delivery time—every request triggered dynamic content generation, creating the soft 404 violations and search engine confusion that plagued implementations at scale.
Content overlays offer a better approach. Instead of stitching content at delivery time, content overlays combine content when previewing and publishing. This fundamental shift in timing eliminates the architectural compromises that made folder mapping problematic.
The benefits are substantial. Content overlays provide explicit preview and publish operations, giving authors control over when content becomes available. They leverage the solid content bus infrastructure for scalable delivery, ensuring consistent performance as implementations grow. Most importantly, they deliver reliable SEO results because content is delivered in the markup on the first fetch, with minimal impact on crawl budget.
Content overlays work through the Bring Your Own Markup (BYOM) concept, which allows external services to generate HTML markup directly for the content bus. When a user requests a page, the system delivers a proper 200 response for valid content or a legitimate 404 for non-existent pages. Search engines can crawl and index content correctly because the content actually exists when it claims to exist, with appropriate titles and metadata in place from the start.
Setting Up BYOM as Content Overlay
Ready to make the switch from folder mapping? The content overlay approach leverages the Bring Your Own Markup (BYOM) concept, which extends AEM's capabilities by allowing composition with external data sources. Since these dynamic pages don't exist in the primary content source, the overlay is activated to generate the markup for these pages.
Here's how to get started:
Configure your site using the Helix Admin API to set up content overlays
Implement your service (edge worker, App Builder action, or third-party service) that generates HTML markup following AEM Edge Delivery Services semantics
Update your site configuration to point to your markup service
Workflow
Once your site configuration is updated, the request flow works as follows:
Request Initiation: A request for preview or publish is made via the API for Edge Delivery Services for a specific page
Overlay Activation: The process generates markup for the requested page
Content Bus Addition: The generated page is added to the content bus, making it available for end users
Response: Invalid page paths return hard 404s, meeting the critical requirement for proper HTTP responses
Moving Forward
If you're currently using folder mapping, reach out to Adobe to discuss the deprecation timeline and migration path for your specific implementation. For teams facing similar large-scale dynamic content challenges, explore content overlays and BYOM as the architectural foundation for your solution—they deliver the operational efficiency of folder mapping without the SEO compromises.
Sometimes the solutions we love most are the ones that teach us the hardest lessons. Folder mapping seduced us with its elegant simplicity, betrayed us with its fundamental flaws, and ultimately led us to something better. That's the cycle of good engineering—falling in love with ideas, having them break your heart, and finding the wisdom to build solutions that won't betray the next person who falls for them.
P.S. For sites with thousands of pages, you can implement automation scripts to manage the publishing process. These scripts monitor data sources for additions and removals, automatically publishing or unpublishing pages while generating HTML markup on the fly. This maintains operational efficiency while ensuring your content catalog stays current without manual intervention.

Bring Your Own Markup
Edge Delivery Services is independent of the authoring tooling and supports multiple content sources. This means you could provide your own content source and publish the content from a repository you already have to AEM without having to migrate the content first.
The API that enables it is called Bring Your Own Markup (BYOM). It uses HTML as the standard data format.
Bring Your Own Markup is widely adopted and two of Adobe's own content sources already implement it. BYOM is generic and easy to implement; it can be used for any content source.
What format should the source bring to the table
The data format for BYOM is HTML - in fact, it is the same semantic HTML structure used by Edge Delivery Services when rendering your website.
For each page that is previewed, your BYOM service must return an HTML response. This means that the HTML must follow the semantics of sections, blocks and default content.
A very minimal example of this looks like:
Extra elements such as span tags, data attributes, or styles are removed when content is ingested. Page metadata can be provided via the common meta tags in the HTML head or via a metadata block with the page content.
Image source URLs within the content must be accessible by Edge Delivery Services. The images will be downloaded and ingested during the preview of the page. Image source can be an absolute URL or relative to the page.
What about sheets?
Structured data in the form of spreadsheets can be provided via BOYM as well. The data is provided as a JSON. The format of the JSON has to follow the Edge Delivery Services sheet format.
Setup BYOM as primary content source
The configuration of BYOM as the primary content source is carried out as for all projects either via fstab.yaml or via the configuration service..
A file based setup will use an fstab.yaml like this:
If the site is set up using the configuration service the site config can be created like this:
The path of the page being published is appended to the provided BYOM source URL.
In both configuration options the "type": "markup" must be present to indicate this is a BYOM content source. "suffix": ".html" is an optional configuration, the admin service will add the suffix when requesting the content from the BYOM service URL.
Setup BYOM as content overlay
BYOM can also be used as an overlay for another content source. It does not matter whether the primary content source is SharePoint, Google Drive or BYOM. However, the overlay content source must always be BYOM. A typical use case for such a setup is, for example, the automatic publishing of product pages directly from the commerce backend.
To use the content overlay the site must use the configuration service. A file based setup via fstab.yaml is not supported.

The Architecture Problem That's Breaking AIs for Content Management (and the Secret Sauce to Fix It)
The Martin-Gropius-Bau sticks out in my commute to Adobe's Berlin office: a russet neo-Renaissance masterpiece from 1881. Martin built it after the Paris Commune, when Berlin thought good architecture could prevent revolutions, every frieze an argument for order.
Martin lived long enough to see the world that necessitated his buildings disappear – train stations becoming glass cathedrals, factories replacing cathedrals. His great-nephew Walter carried these contradictions to America's highways and open-plan offices, where he claimed what Martin couldn't: that beauty might live in absence rather than abundance.
This morning I'm thinking about how every CMS conversation sounds like that family argument. Traditional systems inherit Martin's ambition: more layers, more structure, more ways to express intention. These systems made perfect sense for their moment—until language models arrived, and the question became not what we can build, but what we should when our architect is silicon rather than stone.
Martin's building still stands because it solved a problem that disappeared while he was working on it. Tom Cranstoun's new approach doesn't solve disappearing problems—it solves the one in front of us now: how to build when our partners think in probabilities rather than columns.
Why AI Gets Stuck on Old CMS Architecture
Yesterday in our internal Slack, Bruce (one of your AI engineers) and I unpacked a question that keeps coming up: why do LLMs struggle with traditional CMS architectures?
Here's the problem: traditional CMS gives developers tremendous flexibility with deep nesting, recursive fragments, and complex component trees. But when you're teaching an AI with limited context windows, that flexibility becomes debilitating.
Traditional systems use primitives like "file" and "folder" with no inherent semantics. Edge Delivery uses native HTML semantics - the same language AIs already understand from billions of web pages.
Worse, traditional CMS encourages deep nesting and recursive structures. Great for developers, brutal for AIs trying to reason about content without long-term memory.
Then there's transparency. With traditional systems, you're debugging server-generated HTML you can't see behind bundled dependencies. With Edge Delivery, open DevTools and everything's right there - unminified, unobfuscated, fully transparent.
The final killer? Development loop speed. Traditional setups take minutes to see changes. Edge Delivery updates in the blink of an eye. For AI agents that need frequent iteration to bridge the gap between an 80% solution and the 99% you'll actually deploy, this speed isn't just convenient - it's essential.
Enter Tom's Framework
Tom's been living this problem every day. What started as a simple observation - that developing complex components in Edge Delivery meant jumping between Google Sheets, GitHub, and a local dev server - turned into something bigger.
His framework, documented in The Edge Delivery Services Developer Dilemma and How One Framework Solved It, does three things that made me stop and say "well, that's brilliant":
Local-first development - no more context-switching hell
AI-native architecture - gives your favorite coding assistant full visibility into code, content, and data
Preserves what makes Edge Delivery fast - you still get those 100/100 Lighthouse scores
The architecture that AI dreams of (not the architecture that AI hallucinates of)
Remember what makes Edge Delivery special architecturally? We use HTML semantics natively, keep structures flat and simple, and make everything transparent and open source. Tom's framework doubles down on these principles.
Instead of fighting the platform to get sophisticated components, his dual-directory structure lets you:
Start simple (as always)
Switch to sophisticated when you need it
Have your AI assistant understand the full picture
Ready to See What's Possible?
For me, Tom's blog isn't just another technical post - it's a blueprint for pushing Edge Delivery further than most people thought possible.
The repository is live at on GitHub, and I can guarantee this: your next Edge Delivery project will be easier because of what Tom figured out here.
Check it out, drop thoughts in our Discord, and maybe we get Tom to join our next call to walk through it live.

Unlocking Efficiency with Helix 5: A Scalable Approach to Multi-Site Development
Imagine needing to launch four websites rapidly - while maintaining quality, consistency, and performance. One of our customers faced this exact challenge. They implemented AEM Edge Delivery Services (Helix 5), which enabled them to develop all four sites using a single codebase. This resulted in faster, more efficient deployment with reduced complications.
Why AEM Edge Delivery Services (Helix 5)?
Before Helix 5, teams managed multiple repositories, spreadsheets, and configuration files, creating complexity and inefficiency. The new approach provides a streamlined workflow for multiple websites under one flexible system.
One client needed to launch four websites with unique branding but shared core functionality. Using Helix 5, they utilized a single component library instead of building each site from scratch. This provided faster development, theme-based customization, cross-site consistency, and simpler maintenance. While traditional methods would have required months, the shared codebase approach launched all four websites much faster with fewer complications.
Key Differences from Helix 4
Previously, managing configuration elements for multiple websites meant dealing with scattered spreadsheets and YAML files, leading to complexity and inconsistency.
What Has Changed?
With Helix 5, everything is handled through the Admin API, streamlining updates and ensuring consistency across all sites.
Building Components: Keep It Simple
Developing components in Helix 5 is all about reusability and flexibility. Instead of building custom components for every project, you can create a single set of modular pieces that work across different sites.
Best Practices for Component Development
Use CSS variables for all customizable properties to ensure flexibility.
Avoid hardcoded values to maintain scalability and prevent future design limitations.
Organize components consistently with standard Edge Delivery Services structures—no need for overengineering.
Templates: Standardizing Layouts Without Extra Work
Templates help maintain a consistent look and feel across multiple pages.
Example: Article Page Templates
Instead of reinventing the wheel for each new site, Helix 5 lets teams create template-specific CSS and JS files that can be easily reused:
When multiple templates are needed, we simply add more folders within the templates directory. Each template folder includes its own CSS and JS file to define its design and behaviour. This approach ensures that all article pages have a uniform design, reducing design inconsistencies.
Applying a Template
Templates are assigned using metadata by simply specifying the template name in the Metadata table, meaning no extra coding is required.
Configuration Made Easy
With Helix 5, configurations are managed via the Admin API, eliminating the need for manual file updates.
Sample API Request:
GET https://admin.hlx.page/config/{org)/sites/{website).json
API Response Example:
Theming: Customization Without Chaos
Each website can have its own unique branding while still sharing a common structure.
Theme Structure
To manage multiple site themes, we use a structured approach:
The base styles define the general design, while theme-specific styles are stored in separate CSS files.
Applying a Theme
Each website's theme is assigned in the Metadata table, like this:
A function in scripts.js dynamically loads the corresponding CSS file based on the metadata:
Example of Themed Variables
Each theme defines the same CSS variable names but with different values:
Site 1 Theme Variables
Site 2 Theme Variables
By referencing these variables, components adapt automatically to the active theme:
This approach ensures components remain reusable and adaptable across different sites without requiring individual modifications. Because all components reference these variables, switching themes is effortless!
Final Thoughts
Helix 5 is more than just an upgrade—it’s a smarter way to build, scale, and maintain multiple websites efficiently.
What Makes It Stand Out?
Saves time by reusing components.
Improves code organization with a structured approach.
Reduces effort by simplifying site management.
Minimizes redundant code while allowing site-specific customization.
It represents a major leap forward for edge Delivery Services, enabling the use of a single codebase across multiple websites. By centralizing development into a shared component library, Helix 5 eliminates redundancy while supporting multiple themes and configurations. This structured approach significantly enhances efficiency, scalability, and maintainability in modern web development.
For teams looking to simplify their workflow without compromising on quality, Helix 5 is the way forward.

Bonjour! Hola! Hello! – Creating Multilingual Sites with Ease
For businesses looking to reach a broad audience or customer base, multilingual support is often an essential requirement. The dominant approach is often to create separate content and pathing for each region and language. On larger sites, however, this inevitably leads to an explosion of duplicated content, impacting SEO, user accessibility, and the effort needed by authors to manage and update content. Within this blog post, we’ll be looking at how Edge Delivery Services seeks to address these issues by minimizing the need for duplicate content using a combination of placeholders, indexes, sitemaps, and recommended content structuring practices.
Considering Languages & Regions in Content Structure
Before diving into how to best handle multilingual support, it’s important to consider that apart from differences in language, more sales-oriented sites often may have the added requirement of needing to support different markets/regions as well. The traditional approach is often to create a separate folder for each combination of region and language, leading to pathing like:
However, as discussed, our goal here is to reduce duplicate content. In the example above if Canada and the U.S. both contain the same English pages, then it makes little sense to host these under both paths. This often can alienate some users as well who may want to consume content in a language unsupported by that region ... say a French speaker in the U.S. region. Of course in cases where there is little overlap in content across regions or where each has different branding requirements this approach may still be best.
Where possible though we want to operate with a “language first” approach:
This ensures that only content that is regional needs be created separately. Referring again to our example above, if both the Canadian and U.S. versions of our site share the same “about-us” page then it makes sense to just have this live under:
https://<domain>/en/about-us
Similarly, it follows that the French version of this page can now be made available to all users regardless of region:
https://<domain>/fr/about-us
By using this approach we’ve removed the need to duplicate this page across both English regions while still allowing ourselves the option to create region-specific content. If our Canadian and U.S. regions sell different products for example, we can add that additional specificity to the URL for each and place these pages within regional sub-folders:
Link Rewriting
The unfortunate complication of this new URL structure is that we can’t rely on non-regional pages to link out to the correct regional ones. We'll need to instead leverage sessionStorage, localStorage, or cookies to track a user's region and set up a query index within each language folder and regional subfolder. For every link on a page, we search our user's captured region’s index to see if the links’ relative path exists there and update the link accordingly if it does. If it does not, we instead search through the language index and use the link there if it exists. Continuing with our example, if a U.S. user was to navigate to the “products” page from a non-regional page we would first look through:
https://<domain>/en/us/query-index.jsonSeeing that the links’ relative path is contained within the index (and therefore a regional page) we would then alter the link to point to:
https://<domain>/en/us/productsIf the regional content had not been found, we would have continued our search looking through:
https://<domain>/en/query-index.json
And likely linking to:
https://<domain>/en/products
Leveraging Placeholders for Translations in Code
For multilingual sites we obviously do not want to hard code any language specific strings, particularly on our blocks which are shared across all pages regardless of language. By taking advantage of Edge Delivery Service’s built in placeholders functionality and taking design cues from the previous section we can instead dynamically fetch the properly translated string value based on the pages' location, metadata, or the user’s selected language. Much like with our indexes we create a placeholders spreadsheet within each language folder and populate each with the same keys and their respective translated values. From our code we can now use the “fetchPlaceholders” function and dynamically pass in our captured language value like so:
As an example, let’s look at a basic countdown block which contains the following HTML:
And the related snippets from the placeholder spreadsheets for each language folder:
/en/placeholders.xlsx
/fr/placeholders.xlsx
As you can see by leveraging placeholders we’ve removed any language specific strings from our block code and instead reference shared keys, thereby ensuring we can use the same block anywhere on our site.
Without going into too much detail, you can imagine how this same concept could be applied to our regional folders to alter our code's behavior using placeholders across regions as well.
Content/Document Translation
Of course, having now covered how to handle translations within our code this brings up the question of how best to translate the content itself. Because Edge Delivery Services with document-based editing typically involves using Word, Google Docs, and spreadsheets, we have built in machine translation already available to us right out of the box. In addition, we can assume that nearly all third-party translation services will be able to seamlessly integrate with our choice of editor and content repository. This flexibility in tooling allows us to automate our translation process exactly how we’d like to, allowing for quick content creation within our language subfolders and in turn, across all our sites.
Improving SEO with Sitemaps
Now that we have set up our language specific folders, placeholders files, and query indexes we can now set up our sitemaps in an SEO friendly way. It is common to have sitemaps for each language, Edge Delivery Services supports multiple sitemaps and allows you to set their corresponding hreflang references. Following our example above we should now have both French and English language subfolders, each containing their own query index. In the root folder of our project we can create a file called “helix-sitemap.yaml” and populate it with the following:
This will generate a sitemap for each of our language subfolders based on the indexes we set up within each.
Alternative Configurations
This post only captures the setup of a standard multilingual site. There may be cases where your region/language requirements are entirely different or where your site typically caters to a specific audience, in which case that audience's language would be best placed at the root of the project with alternative languages being contained within subfolders.
For additional information please consult related AEM documentation covering translations, placeholders, and the query index.

Architecture
Edge Delivery Services and document-based authoring are part of the next generation of Adobe Experience Manager’s composable architecture. A key aspect of this architecture is to enable customers to create great experiences using the infrastructure and processes that already enable their success.
How AEM fits in
At the highest level, Adobe Experience Manager is an on origin service that you plug in to your existing Content Delivery Network (CDN). There are out of the box integrations with Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly, and Amazon Cloudfront.
The AEM stack itself is engineered for high performance and availability. In order to achieve best possible availability, all delivery services are run in two fully redundant edge providers, have fully redundant storage infrastructure, and are constantly monitored for performance.
The full picture
Looking at the full stack, there are four key layers:
Your customer-specific infrastructure like CDNs, DNS, TLS certificates, etc.
Adobe’s edge compute layer
Adobe’s storage layer for edge delivery
Your customer-specific sources of content and code
In the visitor-facing tier of this architecture, Edge Delivery Services, customers use their existing CDNs, DNS, certificates, etc. which is then delivering the AEM-produced experience to all modern web browsers, native mobile applications, chat bots, or other backend applications.
The central tier consists of the experience composition service, a dual-stack (for maximum availability) architecture that serves content stored in highly optimized formats for experience delivery. The storage layer is made up of Content Bus for structured and unstructured content, Media Bus for assets and media, and Code Bus for the code of the site.
The bottom tier enables authoring productivity and just like the top tier, it composes the tools and infrastructure already in use, be it AEM Authoring, Microsoft Sharepoint, Word, Excel, or Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets.
How content gets published
The core publishing process is facilitated by the Admin service for preview and publishing and consists of two key steps, both triggered by authors through the sidekick.
The preview operation in sidekick will pull content from the configured content source such as Sharepoint or Google Drive, or Adobe Experience Manager Sites. This integration is based on the standardized delivery format for structured and unstructured content and can be extended to other third-party content providers. Once the content has been pulled from the originating repository, it will be stored in AEM’s storage layer, separated by structured, unstructured content, assets, and media.
In a second step, authors can publish content. This operation takes the previewed content and makes it available to the delivery tier of our infrastructure. The most important step here is to purge the CDN. AEM will purge every layer of the caching infrastructure, thanks to its deep integration with content delivery networks.
What about code?
Like content, AEM uses code from your customer-provided repositories. Unlike content, code is taken from GitHub, using the AEM code sync app for GitHub that has been installed during the initial tutorial.
This integration pulls code from all active branches, enabling effective parallel development and scalable testing. When code is merged into the main branch, the CDN will be purged of all affected resources, making deployments fast and easy.
Lifecycle differences of Content, Media, Code and Configuration.
Internally AEM separates different resources needed to assemble and deliver a website based on their corresponding lifecycle and manages them separately.Content (text in documents and spreadsheets, PDFs, SVGs, redirects, etc.) follow lifecycle states of preview and publish have stages of preview and publish. Content is immediately available to all Code branches on the corresponding .aem.page and .aem.live URLs depending on their previewed / published state.
Media (images, and videos uploaded or copy/pasted into a document) is using Content Addressable Storage internally, meaning that every asset is only stored once with a unique hash following the media_ prefix. Media is accessible on all branch URLs across .aem.page and .aem.live as soon as it is added to the system via a preview operation of the asset itself or a document that contains the asset. Since the hash is produced from the binary content of the asset itself, it is immutable and can be cached permanently.
Code (javascript, css, etc. ) is managed in branches, creating individual environments for every branch. Changes are visible across .aem.page and .aem.live URLs at the same time.
Configuration (via config service) is using inheritance from a profile and is immediately applied to all branch environments on both .aem.page and .aem.live for a particular site.

Staging & Environments
Separating environments for testing and production is an important practice to ensure high availability of your site, which is why AEM provides each developer with a way to test work on their branch that is separate from the production environment on the main branch.
Many organizations also require in their guidelines the creation of a dedicated staging environment. In this guide we discuss the role of staging environments and best practices for implementing them.
You probably don’t need a staging environment
Each repository running on *.aem.live has as many testing environments as there are branches. As long as you enable the GitHub branch protection rules require a pull request before merging, require status checks to pass before merging, and require branches to be up to date before merging, each of your feature branches will be up to date with the main branch before it can be merged and will accurately reflect the nature of your published site.
The practice of setting up a staging environment emerged at a time when computing resources were scarce, and an entire development team had to share a single environment to test their changes. This could lead to adverse effects, for instance a breaking bug in one branch could block all other development from progressing.
With dedicated branches for each feature and fix, and a virtually unlimited number of preview environments for these branches, this is no longer an issue and the workaround of a dedicated staging environment is no longer needed.
aem.page is not a staging environment
In content management, discussions of staging environments are complicated by the fact that authors want to preview their content before being published and developers want to preview their code changes before being merged. With the separation of *.aem.page for content previews and *.aem.live for published content, we provide this ability to authors.
In order to make previewing content as fast as possible, *.aem.page uses different caching rules from *.aem.live, with one being optimized for immediacy, the other for high cacheability.
This means that *.aem.page and *.aem.live behave differently, and consequently *.aem.page should not be used as a staging environment for code. It is a preview environment for content.
You can preview code in all places
As you sometimes need to preview code that refers to content that has not yet been published, the *.aem.page environment supports the same branch-based creation of testing environments.
When you should set up a staging environment
For the vast majority of customers, rule 1: “you probably don’t need a staging environment” applies. In case you are applying complex configurations, rewrite rules, or even custom edge code in your content delivery network (CDN), it is highly advisable to set up a staging environment for the CDN.
The following tips apply:
Use a hostname that follows the pattern of your main website. If your main site is on www.example.com then use stage.example.com as the hostname
Use your main branch on *.aem.live as the origin – your intent is to test the CDN, not AEM-specific code which has been tested on the *.aem.live testing environment. You want to work with real content and accurate caching rules, so use *.aem.live as the origin
Flush caches deliberately. Through the built-in CDN integration, publishing content to *.aem.live and merging code into the main branch will surgically purge the cache to your production CDN. You should ensure that your staging CDN will be purged when appropriate
Setting up a staging CDN is something that is only advised to a small subset of customers. An even smaller subset will have the need to test the interaction between client-side code and CDN configuration.
Following the guideline that there should be as many staging “environments” as there are active branches, it is recommended to set up a staging CDN that mirrors the *.aem.live URL structure, so that ref.examplestage.com will point to ref–-site--example.aem.live., allowing each developer to access a dedicated testing environment that combines client-side code and CDN-side configuration in one accessible place.
Following the reasoning above, creating a separate staging branch and mapping this to a separate CDN site is not advisable.

Security Overview
This security guide covers Edge Delivery Services in Adobe Experience Manager Sites as a Cloud Service, the Admin API for Edge Delivery Services, the Sharepoint integration, and the developer tooling for Edge Delivery Services. There is a separate security guide for the AEM Sidekick. Familiarity with the overall architecture is recommended and assumed for the rest of this guide.
Overall Considerations
Tenant Isolation
All services that are a part of aem.live are multi-tenant. Tenant isolation is built into the publish and delivery services as well as the Content Hub to help ensure required content and data protection.
Write operations (preview or publish) require project details (GitHub owner, repository, branch and, if configured, an access token) and content paths be included in requests. This is required to inform the Admin Service which source document to fetch and where to store the processed content in the Content Hub. Similarly, a content request coming from a customer’s CDN must include the project details and path in its URL structure so the delivery service knows which content to deliver.
Data Encryption
All data in transit is exchanged over secure, encrypted connections using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or greater. All data at rest is encrypted using AES256, with keys managed by two (2) independent cloud service providers.
Product Code
Adobe uses scaled trunk-based development for continuous deployment of AEM Sites as a Cloud Service. We push incremental changes to aem.live as soon as they pass our rigorous reviews and automated testing.
Preview and Delivery
Request Filtering
aem.live applies strict path filtering on the edge for any content it delivers to help reduce potential attack surface. This path filtering is functionally equivalent to a web application firewall (WAF) and prevents thousands of attacks every minute.
Other than generic web application firewalls that are based on deny-lists of known security exploits, AEM uses a strict list of permissible patterns to only permit legitimate traffic.
The deep integration of the edge layer and the underlying services that make up delivery and preview ensures maximum security and high performance without the overhead of a dedicated web application firewall.
Rate and Volume Limiting
All requests and usage of the preview and publish services are subject to rate and volume limits that are applied on a project-by-project basis and continuously monitored. This prevents denial-of-service attacks (DoS), in the form of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and self-inflicted Denial of Service attacks through misconfigured monitoring, bots, and crawlers. The vast majority of attacks prevented fall into the latter category..
Secure Network Routing
Edge Delivery services enforces TLS and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to help ensure that every request is effectively secured.
Site Authentication
Site authentication, once enabled, ensures that only authorized requests can be made to the preview and publish tiers of an AEM site. Requests are required to present one of a list of configured site tokens to be permitted. Users can issue and revoke tokens through the Admin API.
Authors can use the AEM Sidekick to access protected sites using transient site tokens.
Disaster Recovery
The Content Hub is where all published content, media, and code is stored. For this tier, we rely on active/active replication in a multi-cloud setup. Unlike traditional approaches to disaster recovery where like active/standby or multi-region deployments, an active/active multi-cloud setup ensures that any content, media, or code that gets previewed or published is stored redundantly in at least two different cloud providers with different, but functionally identical software stacks.
In case of an outage, even a global outage of a cloud provider's control plane that would affect a multi-region setup, all content is still available in the second cloud provider and operations can resume without data loss.
The active/active deployment means that during normal operations, the workloads are split roughly equally between our cloud providers and only in an outage of one the remaining providers will pick up the load.
The delivery service itself is also deployed redundantly, so in case of an outage at one cloud provider, Adobe can plan to switch to the other and resume delivery instantaneously, if possible. The intended recovery time objective (RTO) for this service is 15 minutes.
Admin API
Authentication
The Admin API strictly requires authentication for all administrative operations and can be set up to require authentication for content operations like previewing or publishing through the sidekick. This requirement extends to the use of the AEM Sidekick.
Authentication is delegated to the identity provider (IdP) that backs the content source of the site, such as Microsoft or Google authentication.
Roles and Permissions
Authors can be assigned different roles based on the tasks they need to perform. The mapping is done in the project configuration. The following roles are built-in:
admin.role.author: This role allows a user to update content in the Preview environment
admin.role.publish: This role allows a user to update content in the Preview and Live environments
Disaster Recovery
The Admin API is currently a single-cloud deployment. In case of an outage in this service, the intended RTO is 12 hours. Adobe regularly conducts disaster recovery tests to validate that both delivery and API services can be restored well within their respective intended RTOs.
Rate and Volume Limiting
All requests and usage of the Admin API are subject to rate and volume limits that ensure smooth operation of the service. In addition to the published limits, Adobe can apply secondary limits on a case-by-case basis.
Backend Integrations
Sharepoint
Please see Sharepoint integration (application) or Sharepoint integration (delegated), depending on your setup.
GitHub
The AEM Code Sync GitHub application uses GitHub permissions to provide access to your GitHub repository, so that code can be made available for serving in the code bus. Following permissions are requested:
read access to metadata – so that code gets assigned to the correct Code Bus space for your repository
read/write access to checks – so that the pull request status can be set when the Pagespeed Insights performance test passes
read/write access to content – so that content can be replicated to the Code Bus. Write access is required to send repositotry_dispatch events and trigger GitHub actions
read/write access to deployments – so that each branch in your GitHub repository can correspond to a deployment on aum.live
read/write access to issues – so that Adobe can raise issues with your code when detected
read/write access to pull requests – so that Adobe can suggest code updates, if required
The Code Sync GitHub app will not perform writes to your repository, but raise PRs, so that your approval will be given for each code change.
Backends with IP Filtering
If your backend only allows connections from a specific list of IPs, add 3.227.118.73 to ensure AEM is able to connect to it.
Author Tooling
AEM Sidekick
The AEM Sidekick is a browser extension installed via Chrome Web Store or Apple App Store and helps authors preview and publish their content. See Sidekick Security for more detailed information.
Developer Tooling
AEM Command Line Application
The AEM Command Line Application is installed via npm and requires access to the developer's file system, so that the site under development can be previewed using code from the developer's working copy.
It also requires network access to *.aem.live and *.aem.page, and validates all requests using Transport Layer Security (TLS) against the node.js certificate store. When man-in-the-middle attacks or tampering with request routing are detected, the command line application refuses to serve a preview site.
Trust, but verify
If you'd like to verify our security claims, as a customer, you are allowed to perform penetration tests against our services, even without advance notice. We ask you to stick to the following rules:
Perform load tests incl. simulated (D)DoS attacks only against production infrastructure, which includes your CDN
If you find a vulnerability, disclose it responsibly to psirt@adobe.com and we'll get back to you

Global Availability
The Edge Delivery Services architecture for Adobe Experience Manager makes use of redundant content delivery networks (CDNs) to ensure high availability with low latency. The cacheable components of your sites are delivered directly from globally-distributed points of presence (POPs).
Your sites, globally available
The two highest priorities in delivering web experiences are availability and performance. For this reason, we use multiple content delivery networks to provide the Adobe Experience Manager service. Multiple CDNs so that, in the rare case of a CDN outage, we can switch the full delivery stack to a separate CDN to provide continued high availability.
Each CDN uses dozens to thousands of different points of presence (POPs): high-performance caching servers located at critical internet junctures in global locations, close to population centers. These POPs cache the content served for your websites and make it available to “nearby” visitors, minimizing the inherent network latency of interactions.
Operational Telemetry is used to maintain awareness of site stability and availability over time.
Your content, globally distributed
In order to ensure this global availability, your cacheable content has to be globally distributed to the same extent that it is published to global visitors. Each of the core storage areas of the AEM content hub (media, content, code) is therefore equally globally-distributed to be within reach of those global visitors.
What about data residency?
The Edge Delivery Services architecture is designed for global publication of information that would normally appear on public sites. Site owners are responsible for ensuring that the information they choose to publish is in compliance with applicable laws or regulations. Likewise, the data we collect for Operational Telemetry is deliberately limited for the sake of privacy and compliance.

China FAQ
Delivering content in China requires following the relevant laws and regulations in China. The FAQ is not intended as legal or regulatory advice of the laws and regulations. We encourage you to seek independent legal advice on your legal and regulatory obligations for your operations in China.
Can I serve visitors in China with Edge Delivery Services?
Edge Delivery Services in Adobe Experience Manager requires a customer-managed Content Delivery Network (BYOCDN) to serve content to visitors in China
Adobe Experience Manager Edge Delivery Services is using two redundant global content delivery networks (CDNs) to deliver experiences across the world. However, certain regions require using a local CDN to serve the content within that region.
To account for this, customers should use customer-managed CDN (BYOCDN) in China to serve visitors from China. CDN operators in China require customers to provide an Internet Content Provider (ICP) license or ICP recordal.
Can content be authored and published from China?
Authoring content from China is possible with limitations and not fully supported by Adobe.
In order to use document-based editing from within China, three things must be accessible to the author:
The document source – note that Google Docs, Sheets, and Drive are not available in China
The API for previewing and publishing content on admin.hlx.page – this API is typically available from within China, but often has increased latency
The preview URLs on aem.page – this host is available most of the time, but disruptions have been observed
How is the developer experience from China?
Edge Delivery Services consume source code from GitHub. Developers collaborating through GitHub from China may experience network latency which is out of Adobe’s control.
Is AEM Hosting available in China?
Edge Delivery Services in Adobe Experience Manager are currently operated outside of China. For customers that require all AEM servers to be hosted in China due to various reasons including, but not limited to, compliance such as Multi-Level Protection Scheme (MLPS), data residency, Baidu SEO, etc. Adobe Managed Services for Adobe Experience Manager are available in China.

Unsupported Integrations
As a composable architecture, AEM embraces integrations with customer’s preferred infrastructure, be it Content Delivery Networks, Content Authoring and Content Repositories, or Web Optimization and Analytics software.
There are a number of integration patterns that have proven to be problematic for security, availability and performance reasons. These patterns are generally discouraged by Adobe. Refer to this document for an outline of integration patterns that are frequently causing issues for AEM customers.
Unsupported Content Delivery Networks
Adobe Experience Manager supports a wide set of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and offers deep integrations, including optimized time-to-live (TTL) and surgical invalidation upon content or code update.
For CDNs not included in this list, following common problems can be observed:
Caching relies on fixed TTLs, slowing down the rollout of content updates and code changes
Caching is often misconfigured or disabled, increasing time-to-first-byte (TTFB) and decreasing web performance
Origin requests sometimes use insecure Transport Layer Security (TLS) practices such as domain fronting, which impedes availability and security of the site
To rectify this, we recommend customers to switch to a supported CDN. Every Adobe Experience Manager license includes access to an Adobe-managed, supported CDN and we provide a guide for picking the right supported CDN.
Discouraged Security Practices
Adobe Experience Manager supports various security configurations and integrations with Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and security tools. However, certain security practices have proven to be problematic for performance and reliability.
TLS Interception
TLS interception or SSL inspection, while intended to enhance security, often creates the following issues:
TLS interception introduces multiple challenges that can severely impact your site's performance and security posture. The additional processing required for intercepting and re-encrypting traffic creates noticeable latency, while improper certificate handling can introduce new security vulnerabilities rather than preventing them.
Furthermore, these interception practices often conflict with modern security protocols, breaking the fundamental promise of end-to-end encryption that many applications rely on. When TLS connections are intercepted, the original security guarantees between the client and server are compromised, potentially exposing sensitive data to unnecessary risks.
Finally, incomplete rollout of custom Certificate Agency (CA) certificate to developers, causing certificate rejection issues in the AEM CLI.
We recommend implementing end-to-end encryption without intermediate TLS termination points, utilizing modern security features built into supported CDNs.
Web Application Firewalls
While WAFs are essential for security, certain implementations can negatively impact site performance.
Web Application Firewalls can introduce performance challenges through synchronous request processing, complex pattern matching rules, inefficient geographic routing, and interference with CDN caching. These factors combine to create unnecessary latency and diminish the performance benefits of your content delivery architecture.
For optimal security and performance, consider using Adobe's built-in WAF security features or implementing WAF solutions through supported CDN providers.

How content is published from AEM Sites authoring to Edge Delivery Services
When using the Universal Editor to author AEM content, publishing is as simple as clicking the Publish button in the Universal Editor. Please see the document Publishing Content with the Universal Editor.
The flow of information when publishing is as follows. Once the author starts publication, this flow is automatic and is illustrated here for information purposes.
NOTE: Up to a maximum of 5000 paths published from the authoring UI or by workflows are permitted per day. Integrations that create bulk-publication work loads are not supported. If your project requires higher capacity, please propose it for the VIP Program.
The content author publishes AEM content in the Universal Editor.
A publish event is pushed to the Adobe pipeline queue.
The Edge Delivery Services publish service forwards the relevant events to Edge Delivery Services admin API.
Edge Delivery pulls and ingests semantic HTML from AEM author.
AEM is updated with publish status.
By default, the Edge Delivery Services admin API is not protected and can be used to publish or unpublish documents without authentication. In order to configure authentication for the admin API as documented in Configuring Authentication for Authors, your project must be provisioned with an API_KEY, which grants access to the publish service. Please reach out to the Adobe team on Slack for guidance.

Furthermore, these interception practices often conflict with modern security protocols, breaking the fundamental promise of end-to-end encryption that many applications rely on. When TLS connections are intercepted, the original security guarantees between the client and server are compromised, potentially exposing sensitive data to unnecessary risks.
Finally, incomplete rollout of custom Certificate Agency (CA) certificate to developers, causing certificate rejection issues in the AEM CLI.
We recommend implementing end-to-end encryption without intermediate TLS termination points, utilizing modern security features built into supported CDNs.
Web Application Firewalls
While WAFs are essential for security, certain implementations can negatively impact site performance.
Web Application Firewalls can introduce performance challenges through synchronous request processing, complex pattern matching rules, inefficient geographic routing, and interference with CDN caching. These factors combine to create unnecessary latency and diminish the performance benefits of your content delivery architecture.
For optimal security and performance, consider using Adobe's built-in WAF security features or implementing WAF solutions through supported CDN providers.

Using the AEM Sidekick (v6)
​​The AEM sidekick provides content authors with a toolbar offering context-aware options so that they can edit, preview, and publish their content directly from the pages of your website.
This document explains how to use the sidekick.
Installation
Please see the document Installing the AEM Sidekick for how to install and configure the sidekick.
Using the Sidekick
The sidekick can be invoked in the following contexts:
Within project environments
Within online editors (depending on your project setup) to edit your content
Google Docs/Sheets
Microsoft Word/Excel
Google Docs/Sheets
Microsoft Word/Excel
To use the sidekick extension, navigate to a URL associated with your project. This can be one of the following:
A SharePoint or Google document (desktop only)
A Preview URL (the domain name ending in .aem.page)
A Live URL (the domain name ending in .aem.live)
A production URL (the domain name being your project’s public host name). Note: This requires adding the project to your configuration
The sidekick extension can be toggled by clicking the Adobe Experience Cloud icon next to the address bar.
Adding Projects
Adding projects to your sidekick configuration is optional for most use cases. The sidekick is able to auto-detect if a URL is associated with your project. If you want the sidekick to also recognize custom domains, such as your project’s production domain, you’ll need to persist the project in your sidekick configuration by clicking the + button on the right hand side..
Environment Switcher
The environment switcher on a sidekick in Google Docs.
When using document-based authoring to create content, content moves from the editor through different environments. The environment switcher allows you to easily jump around between them.
Preview
This option takes you to the preview environment, which reflects the latest changes of the page rendered from the source document. You can also send preview URLs to stakeholders so they can review your content before it gets published. Note that this option is only enabled if the content you are looking at has been previewed before.
The preview URL follows the pattern https://branch--repo--org.aem.page/path.
branch, repo and org identify the location of your project’s underlying code in GitHub
/path corresponds to the location of the content in Google Drive or OneDrive, starting from the root folder.
A / at the end of a path refers to the index document in a folder.
Live
This option is only available if there is not yet a production environment. It shows the published content and serves as a stand-in (and the origin) for your project’s production environment. Note that this option is only enabled if the content you are looking at has been published before.
The live URL looks almost identical to the preview URL, the only difference being in the 1st level domain: https://main--repo--org.aem.live/path
Production
This option takes you to the production environment, which is your project’s public-facing website. Note that this option may not be available during the development stage of your project or because the content has not been published yet.
This environment can be a 3rd-party or “bring your own” CDN. Depending on the project setup, new content may only appear after a delay.
If your public-facing domain name is yourproject.com, the production URL would be https://yourproject.com/path
Actions
There are a number of actions that you can take on your content by conveniently using the sidekick toolbar. Actions that have not been executed since the content was last changed are badged with an orange indicator.
Preview
\ The preview action on a sidekick in Google Docs.
Preview is the predominant action in the editor. It (re)generates the preview page based on the current document and opens it in a separate tab.
Edit
The Edit action is available in all three environments. It opens the online editor of the current page’s source document in a separate window.
The sidekick in a preview environment.
At a minimum read access to the document in Google Drive or OneDrive is required to use this action.
Reload
The Reload action is available in the preview environment only. It can be used to force a content refresh, for example if you have editor and preview open side by side while working on the content. The action is identical to the Preview action in the editor.
Publish
The Publish action is available in all three environments and makes the current preview version of the page available in the live and production environments.
The sidekick in a live environment.
Visitors to your public-facing website will not be able to see changes until they are published.
Bulk Actions
Open the sidekick in Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint and select one or more files to bulk preview and publish files and conveniently copy their URLs. You can also use this feature to preview and publish media like SVG or PDF files.
Adobe continues to extend the support for file formats that can be published directly from your content source (SharePoint or GDrive) based on popular use and security considerations. Currently the supported formats include: PDF, SVG, JPG, PNG.
Formats that are under consideration for being added include: XML, MP4 as well as raw DOCX, XLSX, PPTX without transformation.
Limitation: in Microsoft SharePoint, larger selections (more than 60) may not be fully exposed to the sidekick and may therefore need to be split into smaller badges.
Bulk Preview
Selecting multiple documents in SharePoint or GDrive allows you to preview multiple documents en masse.
Bulk preview in Google Drive.
Bulk Publish
Selecting multiple documents in SharePoint or GDrive allows you to publish multiple documents en masse.
Bulk publish in Google Drive..
Copy URLs
Use this feature to copy the preview, live or production URLs of one or multiple files.
Unpublishing Content
If you need to remove content from your website, the first thing to do is to delete, rename, or move the underlying source document in Google Docs or OneDrive.
For a page without a source document (i.e. it was renamed or moved), the sidekick will show the following two actions when invoked in the preview environment.
Note: If you are signed in to the sidekick, you can skip deleting the underlying source document and simply hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key to bring up the Delete and Unpublish actions.
The sidekick on a preview page without a source document.
Delete
The Delete action will permanently delete the page from all environments, implicitly unpublishing it.
Unpublish
This Unpublish action will unpublish the page, but still keep it in the preview environment for reference.
See the document Authoring and Publishing Content for more information about deleting content.
Caution: The Delete and Unpublish actions cannot be undone! Double-check the URL and page content to make sure it is really OK to delete and/or unpublish a page. The source document may have been moved accidentally and may not need to be deleted.
Sharing the Sidekick
You can share the sidekick configuration for your project by clicking the share symbol at the top right. This will copy a shareable URL to your clipboard and allow you to paste it in a DM or email to a colleague. The share URL will enable the recipient to effortlessly install the sidekick for your project.
See the document Installing the AEM Sidekick for more information.
Customizing the Sidekick
If you are a developer, you can customize the sidekick for your project.
Privacy and Security
Review AEM Sidekick Security for detailed information about how privacy and security are being handled in the Sidekick.

Cloudflare Setup (worker) for hlx.live
NOTE: The instructions linked on this page apply to the previous version of Edge Delivery Services and are provided for customers who have not upgraded to aem.live yet. The current version of this document is provided here.
The following screenshots illustrate how to configure Cloudflare to deliver content. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
This setup can be completely done in the browser by using the Cloudflare Dashboard only. If you are already familiar with Cloudflare Workers, Wrangler & GitHub and not afraid of entering commands in a terminal window you might want to follow the instructions here instead.
Create a Cloudflare site
If you already have a cloudflare site and DNS setup you can skip forward to the Setup push invalidation section.
Enter the domain:
Select a plan:
Note that surgical push invalidations are only supported on the Enterprise plan. On all other plans the entire cache of the site will be purged every time an author publishes a content change.For this walk-through we’ll use the Free plan.
Setup push invalidation for Cloudflare
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is configured by adding specific properties to the project's configuration:
If you are using the configuration service, see here how to update the CDN configuration.
Otherwise, see here for document-based CDN configuration.
Configuration properties:
values: free, pro, business, enterprise
default: free
To create an API Token,
go to API Tokens
click on "Create Token",
go to "Create Custom Token" at the bottom and click on "Get started"
enter a token name (e.g. "Production Site Purge Token"),
Permissions: "Zone", "Cache Purge", "Purge"
Zone Resources: "Include", "Specific zone", "<your production zone>"
click on "Continue to summary"
click on "Create Token",
copy the generated token value.
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
DNS Setup
For a new site, we’ll start with a simple DNS setup.
Create a new CNAME record. If your zone is example.com and you want to serve traffic on www.example.com, then the name should be www
If you want to serve traffic on example.com (without a www) then the name should be @
And if you want to serve traffic on all subdomains, then the name should be * as in the screenshot below
As we are using workers to serve the content, the value of the Content field does not matter. It’s easiest to use your ref--repo--owner.hlx.live host name here. This is a hostname, not a URL, so leave out the leading https://
Make sure the CNAME record is Proxied:
SSL/TLS Setup
Select SSL/TLS from the left pane and Edge Certificates in the dropdown list:
On the right side, scroll down to Always Use HTTPS and enable it:
Configure Caching
Create Cache Rules
Note: Enable Origin Cache Control option is only available for enterprise accounts. Free, Pro, and Business customers have this option enabled by default and cannot disable it.
Create Worker
Choose Workers in the left pane and click on “Manage Workers”:
Click on “Create a Service”:
Enter a name for the worker (e.g. “helix-worker”) and click on “Create Service”:
Click on “Quick edit”:
Edit worker code
If you have successfully configured push invalidation copy the content of this file, otherwise copy the content of this file.
In the left pane, replace the existing content with the copied content.
Click on “Save and Deploy”:
Click on Settings and “Add variable”:
Add a variable ORIGIN_HOSTNAME and set the value to the hostname of your origin (e.g. main--mysite--hlxsites.hlx.live):
Click on Triggers an select “Add route”:
Enter your domain route (e.g. www.mydomain.com/*), select your zone and click on “Add route”:
Depending on the setup chosen in DNS Setup, you would select routes www.mydomain.com/*, mydomain.com/*, or *.mydomain.com/*After completing all steps you should be all set.
Expanding the AEM footprint on your website
In case you start with having only a portion of the website being routed to your .live origin and have routed a specific folder (eg. /blog/*) you can subsequently add more routes whenever you are ready to expose new sections of the site by simply adding more routes and repeat the last “add route” steps as needed, without changing your worker configuration.
Watch out for duplicate content
Search engines often penalize sites for duplicate content, so it's important to make sure your content is not available on the web elsewhere. Cloudflare, unfortunately, has a default setting that will expose your site on additional network ports. In paid Cloudflare plans you can block traffic on these additional ports. This is a recommended setting for production sites.

Akamai Setup for hlx.live
NOTE: The instructions linked on this page apply to the previous version of Edge Delivery Services and are provided for customers who have not upgraded to aem.live yet. The current version of this document is provided here.
The following screenshots illustrate how to use the Akamai Property Manager to configure a property to deliver content from AEM using your Akamai CDN setup. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
Essential Property settings
Origin Server
Configuration properties:
Add Behavior: Remove Vary Header
Configuration properties:
Add Behavior: Modify Outgoing Request Header
Configuration properties:
Add more outgoing request headers:
Configuration properties:
Configuration properties:
Add/Modify Behavior: Caching
Configuration properties:
Add Behavior: HTTP/2
(Optional, but recommended)
Add Rule: Modify Outgoing Response Header
Create a new rule
Set the criteria for the rule to be applied
Set the behavior if a match is found
These are all essential property settings for delivering content.
Caveats
Do not enable Akamai mPulse Real Usage Monitoring. While the performance impact on most sites is negligible, for sites built for consistent high performance, enabling it will prevent reaching a Lighthouse Score of 100. In AEM, you have a Real User Monitoring service built-in, so that dual instrumentation will be unnecessary and is strongly discouraged.
Also, do not enable Akamai Bot Manager or similar Web Application Firewall offerings, as they markedly interfere with rendering performance and user experience. Your site on AEM is protected against bot attacks on the backend, so that this performance cost comes with negligible benefit.
Setup push invalidation for Akamai
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is enabled by adding specific properties to the project's configuration (an Excel workbook named .helix/config.xlsx in Sharepoint or a Google Sheet named .helix/config in Google Drive).
Configuration properties:
AEM push invalidation uses the Akamai Fast Purge API, specifically Delete by URL and Delete by cache tag.
The Fast Purge API credentials consist of
They can be generated by following the instructions at Create an API client with custom permissions.
Go to Identity & Access Management:
Create API client:
Required group/role permissions:
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
Special Mention - Akamai Edge-Control Headers
AEM uses a fine tuned, production hardened way to supply caching information that applies to the specific CDN, in conjunction with our reliable push invalidation. This allows us to improve cache efficiency and consistency over traditional TTL based approaches.
Every CDN vendor supports a way to directly influence how to instruct caching and we are excited to see standardization efforts like "Targeted Cache Control" (TCC) being on the roadmap for Akamai (see: https://www.akamai.com/blog/news/targeted-cache-control), in the meantime we are using Akamai's long-term supported Edge-Control header.

Publishing pages with AEM Assets
When editing content for the Universal Editor, you of course can select assets from AEM Assets. When you publish your content to Edge Delivery Services, the related AEM Assets content is published as well.
To ensure this seamless behavior, AEM and Edge Delivery Services must have proper access to AEM Assets in order to publish. This includes:
Ensuring that assets folders are accessible.
Ensuring that the assets folder is assigned the proper configuration (as required).
This document describes how to configure these two points.
Ensuring assets folders are accessible
When publishing pages from AEM to Edge Delivery Services, a technical account is used. This account, with a name in the format <hash>@techacct.adobe.com, is created automatically as a user in AEM by Cloud Manager whenever you first publish a page created with the Universal Editor.
This technical account must have access rights to all AEM Assets folders in order to publish their content. You can either:
Not use private AEM Assets folders.
Grant the technical account user access to the AEM Assets folders.
Ensuring Assets Folder is Assigned Proper Configuration
Generally assuring that your technical account has access to your assets in AEM Assets is sufficient for publishing your assets along with your pages to Edge Delivery Services.
Additional configuration is needed in two additional cases, however:
If you wish to publish pages with non-image assets such as PDFs or videos to Edge Delivery Services.
If you wish to publish image assets to Edge Delivery Services independently of pages.
To support both these use cases, a configuration must be assigned to the AEM Assets folder.
Sign into your AEM authoring environment.
Under Sites select the site where you are publishing your assets or the site with which the assets will be associated.
Tap or click Properties in the tool bar.
On the Advanced tab in the properties window, take note of the configuration in the field Cloud Configuration.
This is created automatically when you create your site in the format /conf/<site-name>.
This is created automatically when you create your site in the format /conf/<site-name>.
Tap or click Cancel in the properties window and navigate to Assets → Files and select your AEM Assets folder.
Tap or click Properties in the tool bar.
On the Cloud Services tab of the properties window, in the Cloud Configuration field, select the same configuration as you noted previously.
Tap or click Save & Close.

Configuring Google Analytics & Tag Manager Integration
This article will walk you through the steps of setting up an integration with Google Analytics (GA) and Google Tag Manager (GTM) . This will let you automatically track page view and custom events, along with any other tags configured in your GTM containers.
Choosing the Right Integration
This document covers integration with Google's marketing technology stack(Google Analytics 4, Google Tag Manager).
Looking for Adobe Experience Cloud integration instead?See our Adobe Experience Cloud Integration guide.
When to Use This Integration
You're using Google Analytics as your primary analytics solution
You want to leverage Google Tag Manager for tag management
You're already invested in the Google marketing ecosystem
Integration Comparison
Integration Overview
The Google Analytics & Tag Manager integration provides a streamlined marketing technology stack that enables:
Comprehensive analytics with Google Analytics 4
Flexible tag management through Google Tag Manager
Custom event tracking for business-specific metrics
Performance-optimized loading aligned with AEM EDS phases
Privacy-compliant data collection
This integration is designed to work seamlessly with AEM Edge Delivery Services while maintaining optimal performance and user experience.
How It Works
The integration splits the traditional monolithic GTM approach into optimized phases:
Google Analytics 4 Tag: Provides comprehensive web analytics and user behavior tracking
Google Tag Manager: Manages all marketing tags and pixels from a centralized interface
Google Data Layer: Standardizes data collection and event tracking
Phased Loading: Separates critical tracking from delayed tag execution
First-Party Data: Ensures reliable tracking while respecting privacy preferences
Rationale
In a traditional GTM implementation, one container is used to initialize tracking and load all other containers. This approach typically has a performance impact on the initial page load, degrading the Core Web Vitals (CWV).
This optimized approach attaches tracking actions to the Edge Delivery Services phases. By splitting up the loading of the libraries and containers, we have minimized the impact on page performance, while maintaining page event tracking.
Performance Benefits
Reduced initial load time by deferring non-critical tags
Improved Core Web Vitals through phased loading
Faster Time to Interactive by prioritizing essential tracking
Maintained tracking accuracy while optimizing performance
Pre-requisites
Before you can use this plugin, make sure you have access to:
Google Analytics account with GA4 property configured
Google Tag Manager account with container(s) set up
You'll also need the following information:
Google Analytics Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
Google Tag Manager container ID(s) (format: GTM-XXXXXXX)
If using multiple containers, ensure to make note of which should be loaded in the different phases (lazy or delayed)
GTM Container Configuration
Ensure your GTM container has the necessary tags configured
Set up triggers for page views and custom events
Configure variables for data layer values
Test your container in preview mode before deploying
Installation & Configuration
Step 1: Install the Plugin
Follow the technical steps in the aem-gtm-martech GitHub repository.
Step 2: Configure Consent Management
Make sure you implement and pass a consentCallback according to the documentation. This is essential for GDPR/CCPA compliance.
Privacy Considerations: The integration includes built-in consent management support. Default consent is set to require explicit user permission before tracking begins.
Step 3: Deploy Your Code
Commit and push your code branch to trigger the deployment.
Step 4: Test the Integration
Open a browser to the branch containing the plugin and verify the configuration.
Verification & Testing
To verify the configuration is correct you can:
Browser-Based Testing
Use the Google Tag Assistant Chrome extension to view the events
Use the Google Tag Assistant site to view events in real-time
Monitor the network tab for scripts loaded from Google
Check for calls to https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect
Google Analytics Verification
Check real-time reports in Google Analytics
Verify page view events are being recorded
Test custom event tracking
Confirm conversion tracking (if configured)
GTM Preview Mode
Use GTM's preview mode to debug tag firing
Verify data layer variables are populated correctly
Check that triggers are working as expected
Validate tag configurations
Expected Network Activity
When properly configured, you should see:
GA4 measurement calls to google-analytics.com
GTM container loads from googletagmanager.com
Data layer pushes in browser console (if debugging enabled)
Privacy & Consent Management
The integration provides comprehensive privacy controls:
Default consent state: Requires explicit user permission
Granular consent categories: Analytics, marketing, preferences
Consent callback integration: Works with popular consent management platforms
Data retention controls: Configurable data retention periods
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
No tracking data in Google Analytics:
Verify your GA4 Measurement ID is correct
Check that consent has been granted
Ensure GTM container is published, not just saved
Monitor browser console for JavaScript errors
GTM tags not firing:
Check GTM preview mode for trigger debugging
Verify data layer variables are populated
Ensure consent is properly granted for relevant storage types
Check tag configuration and triggers
Performance degradation:
Review the number of tags in your GTM container
Consider moving non-critical tags to delayed phase
Monitor Core Web Vitals impact
Optimize trigger conditions to reduce unnecessary tag fires
Debugging Tools
GTM Preview Mode: Real-time tag debugging
Google Tag Assistant: Browser extension for validation
GA4 DebugView: Real-time event monitoring
Browser DevTools: Network and console monitoring

Cloudflare Zero Trust Site Protection
Integrating Cloudflare Zero Trust provides granular control over who can access your website or applications. Through its authentication and authorization features, you can ensure only users that meet your defined security criteria are granted access, which reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential threats.
Prerequisites
To follow this guide you will need the following
A previously setup Edge Delivery Services site, for this demo, we’ll use a site called zero-trust-site in the aemsites github org.
You will need to be a configuration administrator of the org or site and have an authorization token to make requests to the configuration service.
If you don’t already have a site to use, create an Edge Delivery Website by following our developer tutorial.
Create a Cloudflare Site
Follow the steps to set up a Cloudflare site and worker using the wrangler CLI. If you’re hosting the application on a subdomain, ensure your CNAME record is updated accordingly. In this guide, we configured a CNAME record for our example application at zero-trust.example.com.
Create a site secret
Create a site access token, this token can be used to restrict access to your edge delivery site.
In the response you will get back an id and a value. Keep track of these as you will need them in the next steps.
Enable site authentication using the site token
Use the token id from the response above in place of the TOKEN_ID in the body.
The .page and .live origins will now be protected. Users wanting to access the site directly via these origins will now need to sign into the sidekick.
Set Zero Trust Authentication methods
Navigate to the Zero Trust home from the left navigation bar in Cloudflare
and select Settings and the pick Authentication
From Login methods select the Add new button
This is your opportunity to configure the identity provider you want to use for your site. For this demo we will use One-time PIN.
Setup the Zero Trust Policies
Select Access → Policies
Select the Add a policy button
Add a policy with the name TestApp_EmailAccessPolicy and duration of 24 hours. Change either of these values as you see fit.Under rules, you can pick whether there is an explicit list of emails you want to have access to the application or want to allow an entire domain access. For this example we will allow anyone with an email address ending in adobe.com to access the site.
Select Save
Create the Zero Trust Application
Select Access → Applications and click the Add an application button
Select Self-hosted
Enter TestApp or any name of your choice for the application name. You can keep the session duration set to 24 hours.
Select Add public hostname and enter in the domain (and optional subdomain) you setup in the first step of this guide. For path enter *. For our demo we are setting out public hostname to zero-trust.example.com
Under Access policies click Select existing policies
Select our TestApp_EmailAccessPolicy we previously created and click Confirm.
Select Next at the bottom to get to the Login methods page
Below, you’ll find a list of all the login methods permitted for our application. By default, Accept all available identity providers is selected. However, if you deselect this option, you can choose a specific login method from the list of configured options. Currently, only the One-time PIN has been set up, so it is the only available choice.
Select Next again to get to the advanced settings page.
Open the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings and enable Bypass options requests to origin to let Edge Delivery handle CORS.
Select Save
Now select the 3 dots on the right of the new application and click Edit.
Take note of the Application Audience Tag, we will need this in a future step.
Update the worker
Next, we’ll update our worker to validate incoming requests, ensuring only approved traffic can access your site.
Install the jose package
In the worker code we created at the start of the guide, install the jose package. This library is designed to simplify working with JWT tokens.
npm install jose
Edit worker code
Copy the content of this file and paste it into src/index.js
Import functions from the jose package
At the top of the index file, add the following to import the required functions from the jose package.
import { jwtVerify, createRemoteJWKSet } from "jose";
Add token validation logic
Around line 26 at the top of your handleRequest method, insert the following logic to validate the JWT token provided in the cf-access-jwt-assertion header. This snippet retrieves the token, sets up the verification context by referencing your Cloudflare Access domain and audience, and uses a remote JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) to verify the token’s integrity. If the token is missing or fails verification, the worker immediately returns an error response, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized requests proceed.
Update wrangler.toml
Note: Some of the values below are considered sensitive and must be kept confidential; ensure they are securely stored and never committed to a public repository in GitHub.
Update route to to match your DNS setup (ex zero-trust.example.com/*)
Ensure you have the correct account_id set. To find your account_id visit the Websites Dashboard in Cloudflare, select your site and it will be listed on the right hand side of the dashboard under API.
Ensure the compatibility_date is set to at least 2025-03-17
Update the ORIGIN_HOSTNAME to the edge delivery origin host name (for instance main--zero-trust-site--aemsites.aem.live)
If commented out, remove the # in front of PUSH_INVALIDATION
Update the ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION to the value from the site token created in a previous step (ex hlx_sQP7218fBcODiUi7NLVUH6VVTpucnHIA51yEuDFS0GE0)
Get your team domain by going to the Zero Trust dashboard and opening Settings → Custom Pages. Create a new variable with the name TEAM_DOMAIN and the your team domain (for instance dylandepass.cloudflareaccess.com)
Create a new variable called POLICY_AUD and set it to the AUD value from the Zero Trust application you created above.
Your wrangler.toml should look something like this.name = "zero-trust-worker"
Congratulations, your site should now be protected by Cloudflare Zero Trust. Try navigating to your site and authenticating using a PIN. Upon successful authentication you should see your site.

Cloudflare Setup (with wrangler)
The following screenshots illustrate how to configure Cloudflare using the wrangler command line interface to deliver AEM content. Essential settings are marked with a red circle.
Create a Cloudflare site
Enter the domain:
Select a plan:
For this walk-through we’ll use the Free plan.
Setup push invalidation for Cloudflare
Push invalidation automatically purges content on the customer's production CDN (e.g. www.yourdomain.com), whenever an author publishes content changes.
Content is purged by url and by cache tag/key.
Push invalidation is configured by adding specific properties to the project's configuration:
If you are using the configuration service, see here how to update the CDN configuration.
Otherwise, see here for document-based CDN configuration.
Configuration properties:
values: free, pro, business, enterprise
default: free
To create an API Token,
go to API Tokens
click on "Create Token",
go to "Create Custom Token" at the bottom and click on "Get started"
enter a token name (e.g. "Production Site Purge Token"),
Permissions: "Zone", "Cache Purge", "Purge"
Zone Resources: "Include", "Specific zone", "<your production zone>"
click on "Continue to summary"
click on "Create Token",
copy the generated token value.
You can validate the credentials with this tool.
DNS Setup
We’ll skip the DNS setup step as this would be beyond the scope of this simple walk-through. Make sure the CNAME record is Proxied:
SSL/TLS Setup
Select SSL/TLS from the left pane and Edge Certificates in the dropdown list:
On the right side, scroll down to Always Use HTTPS and enable it:
Configure Caching
Create Page Rule
Create Worker
Fork or create a new GitHub repository using this template.Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README. You can skip directly to step 2.After completing all steps you should be all set.

Using GitHub Actions to handle Publication Events
Franklin has a lightweight integration with GitHub actions that allows you to run a GitHub actions workflow whenever a page or sheet in Franklin has been published or unpublished. As GitHub actions is a powerful runtime for all kinds of integrations, you can use it as a springboard to further integrations, for instance using WebHooks, API calls, or even other GitHub workflows.
Franklin can send resource-published and resource-unpublished events to your GitHub repository, where they can trigger a GitHub actions workflow
From there, you can perform further processing, apply conditions, call other APIs or workflow steps
The key starting point is to listen for the repository_dispatch event https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch
You can find an example workflow on the Franklin Website https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/log-publish.yml (it sends a notification to Slack)

Why I don’t recommend UI testing in AEM (even though I write tests for my own projects)
When customers or partners ask me, “Should we write UI tests for our AEM projects?”, I usually say, “No, probably not.” But here’s the twist: when I’m working on something like Optel Explorer or AEM Sidekick, I write extensive tests.
Sounds contradictory, right?
It’s not. It’s all about understanding the cost-benefit trade-off of testing and most importantly, knowing why we test in the first place.
Let’s start with the basics: Why do we test?
Testing isn’t glamorous but it’s the quiet force behind fast releases, fewer bugs, and happier users. We don’t test just to tick a box; we test to gain confidence. Confidence that our code works, that we can ship faster and that users won’t hit broken experiences in production.
But testing comes at a cost: time, complexity, maintenance, and infrastructure. So the real question becomes: Is the benefit of testing worth the cost in this context?
Think of testing like insurance. You don’t insure everything—you insure what’s valuable and vulnerable. Similarly, in software, we should test where the impact of failure is high and the cost of testing is low.
Let’s bring this to life with two contrasting examples.
Scenario 1: Backend Utility Library
Imagine you're building a backend library that’s used across multiple services. If something breaks here, the consequences are serious. A single bug could ripple across dozens of features. Fortunately, testing this kind of logic is straightforward. It can be done in isolation, without any UI, using fast and reliable unit tests. Since the logic doesn’t change often, the tests remain stable and require minimal upkeep.
In this case, the value of testing is high, and the cost is low. It’s a no-brainer; definitely worth the effort.
Scenario 2: UI Testing in AEM
Now picture writing UI tests for a visual component in AEM. A misaligned button or a slightly off layout might be annoying, but it rarely breaks the user experience. Setting up automated UI tests, however, is anything but simple. Frameworks like Playwright or Web Test Runner require significant setup, and the tests themselves are fragile - small, unrelated changes can cause them to fail. Maintaining them becomes a chore.
Here, the value is low, and the cost is high. In most cases, it’s just not worth it.
Why Any CMS Makes UI Testing Even Harder
Content Management Systems (CMSs) are designed for flexibility, not predictability and that’s exactly what makes UI testing in these environments so challenging.
Components are rendered dynamically based on authored content, which can vary wildly. Different authors structure pages differently, introducing inconsistencies that automated tests struggle with. What works locally might fail in CI/CD due to rendering differences or timing issues. And DOM structures change often due to styling or layout updates, breaking tests even when functionality is intact.
Unless you’re testing a critical user flow like login, checkout, or form submission - UI tests in CMS environments often become more of a maintenance burden than a quality safeguard.
So, should you test in AEM?
Yes, but strategically.
Focus your efforts on areas that carry real weight: backend logic, reusable libraries, critical user journeys like login or checkout, and integrations that tie systems together. These are the pillars of your application’s reliability.
On the other hand, let go of the urge to validate every pixel. Visual tweaks on content-heavy pages, components that shift frequently, or purely aesthetic elements rarely justify the overhead. They tend to break often, demand constant updates, and offer little in return.
Final Thought: Test with Purpose, Not by Habit
Testing isn’t a ritual. It’s a strategic decision. That’s why I write tests for my other projects but still advise others to think twice for writing tests in AEM. Because I know exactly what I’m validating, why it matters, and what I’m prepared to maintain. I’m not chasing perfection, I’m investing in stability where it counts.
In the world of Content Management Systems, where the UI is dynamic, content-driven, and constantly evolving, the cost of exhaustive UI testing often outweighs the value it brings. So instead of testing everything, focus on what truly matters.Think in terms of impact versus effort. Validate what’s stable, critical, and cost-effective. Let go of what’s fragile, cosmetic, or constantly shifting.
That’s how you build AEM solutions that are not only reliable but agile, efficient, and future-proof.

↑↑↓↓←→←→ B A START: The Konami Code for Dynamic Publishing at Scale
Last week spelled deprecation for folder mapping. This week, two developers showed us what rises from its ashes.
Between them, Eric Van Geem and Lars Auffarth published 13,000 pages dynamically. No manual authoring. No static builds. Just pure, automated content delivery at scale through Edge Delivery's new BYOM and content overlay capabilities.
The cabinet hums with electricity. Neon pixels spell out "CHOOSE YOUR FIGHTER" as two champions materialize on screen. This isn't Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. It's the Edge Delivery Services arena, where developers battle the final boss: dynamic publishing at massive scale.
CHOOSE YOUR FIGHTER
[PLAYER 1] THE AZURE ARCHITECTName: Eric Van GeemClass: Cloud Infrastructure WarriorPower Level: 10,000 profile pagesHome Stage: Azure Data CentersSpecial Move: Cosmos DB Trigger Combo
[PLAYER 2] THE APP BUILDER MAGEName: Lars AuffarthClass: Serverless SorcererPower Level: 3,000 product pagesAffiliation: Adobe AllianceUltimate Attack: Edge Worker Price Strike
Round 1: The Azure Architect's Combo
Eric opens with a devastating infrastructure combo. His Azure Cosmos DB stores 10,000 fighter profiles, each one waiting to enter the arena. The combo sequence: Cosmos DB Change Feed → Azure Function Trigger → Service Bus Queue → Timer Function → Helix Admin API → Vercel Overlay Server. When a profile updates in the database, his automated pipeline springs to life, throttling requests to respect API limits while maintaining relentless pressure on the content delivery boss.
His secret weapon? A Node.js Express server deployed on Vercel that acts as the overlay endpoint. When Edge Delivery requests /people/marty-mcfly, Eric's server fetches the data, merges it with a template, and returns pixel-perfect HTML. No manual intervention. No content duplication. Just pure, automated publishing fury.
Round 2: The App Builder Mage's Spellcast
Lars counters with native Adobe magic. His App Builder actions orchestrate a symphony of serverless functions. The spell components: Commerce API Webhook → App Builder Orchestrator → BYOM Renderer → Edge Worker Price Injection. Three thousand product pages dance to his command, each one updating automatically when backend data shifts.
His finishing move deploys edge workers that inject live pricing after page load—a technique so advanced it bends the rules of static delivery. While Eric's approach handles everything at publish time, Lars splits the attack: static content from BYOM, dynamic pricing from the edge. The boss never sees it coming.
Co-op Mode Unlocked: Convergent Evolution
Here's where the game gets interesting. Despite choosing different characters and tech stacks, both players discovered the same hidden mechanics. They mastered the template pattern, using HTML templates with placeholder replacement to transform data into pages. They both configured content overlays in Edge Delivery's config, unlocking the secret passage to dynamic publishing. They learned the 404 wisdom—returning proper 404s for missing content instead of taking soft 404 boss damage. They respected the semantic block architecture, generating Edge Delivery-compatible markup that flows through the same rendering pipeline. And perhaps most importantly, they achieved total automation, eliminating manual publishing entirely.
They're not competing. They're playing co-op mode against the same boss: the tyranny of manual content management at scale.
Loading Screen Tip: Master Your Own Moveset
But every fighter has unique abilities. Eric's Azure style gives him a self-hosted overlay server for maximum control. He can show visual proof of his victories with live sitemap.xml and query-index.json files. His architecture stays simpler for non-Adobe environments, with direct database integration patterns that any cloud warrior can understand.
Lars's App Builder technique plays differently. He wields zero infrastructure management through true serverless power. Native Adobe authentication and identity flow through his combos naturally. His event-driven orchestration creates richer attack patterns, while his split rendering strategy divides static and dynamic content like a master tactician.
Here's the secret: don't just memorize their button combos. Study how Eric leveraged his Azure expertise. Notice how Lars maximized Adobe's native capabilities. The best architects don't carbon copy moves—they understand the underlying mechanics and craft their own fighting style. Maybe you're a Google Cloud Platform warrior with Cloud Functions and Firestore ready to strike. Perhaps you're a Cloudflare champion with edge compute mastery. Your unique strengths are your special moves.
The Hidden Connection: Last Week's Update
These championship rounds wouldn't be possible without last week's game update by Farhan. When folder mapping got deprecated, it opened the door for Content Overlays and BYOM to become the new meta. These tools delivered what folder mapping promised but couldn't achieve: true dynamic publishing with proper SEO, hard 404s, and unlimited scale.
Game Over? Not Even Close
Thirteen thousand pages published. Two completely different approaches. One incredible community.
Eric showed us that BYOM works brilliantly with any cloud infrastructure. Lars proved that Adobe's own tools can orchestrate publishing symphonies. They built real systems that handle real scale, and shared every detail so you can too.

The Architecture Problem That's Breaking AIs for Content Management (and the Secret Sauce to Fix It)
The Martin-Gropius-Bau sticks out in my commute to Adobe's Berlin office: a russet neo-Renaissance masterpiece from 1881. Martin built it after the Paris Commune, when Berlin thought good architecture could prevent revolutions, every frieze an argument for order.
Martin lived long enough to see the world that necessitated his buildings disappear – train stations becoming glass cathedrals, factories replacing cathedrals. His great-nephew Walter carried these contradictions to America's highways and open-plan offices, where he claimed what Martin couldn't: that beauty might live in absence rather than abundance.
This morning I'm thinking about how every CMS conversation sounds like that family argument. Traditional systems inherit Martin's ambition: more layers, more structure, more ways to express intention. These systems made perfect sense for their moment—until language models arrived, and the question became not what we can build, but what we should when our architect is silicon rather than stone.
Martin's building still stands because it solved a problem that disappeared while he was working on it. Tom Cranstoun's new approach doesn't solve disappearing problems—it solves the one in front of us now: how to build when our partners think in probabilities rather than columns.
Why AI Gets Stuck on Old CMS Architecture
Yesterday in our internal Slack, Bruce (one of your AI engineers) and I unpacked a question that keeps coming up: why do LLMs struggle with traditional CMS architectures?
Here's the problem: traditional CMS gives developers tremendous flexibility with deep nesting, recursive fragments, and complex component trees. But when you're teaching an AI with limited context windows, that flexibility becomes debilitating.
Traditional systems use primitives like "file" and "folder" with no inherent semantics. Edge Delivery uses native HTML semantics - the same language AIs already understand from billions of web pages.
Worse, traditional CMS encourages deep nesting and recursive structures. Great for developers, brutal for AIs trying to reason about content without long-term memory.
Then there's transparency. With traditional systems, you're debugging server-generated HTML you can't see behind bundled dependencies. With Edge Delivery, open DevTools and everything's right there - unminified, unobfuscated, fully transparent.
The final killer? Development loop speed. Traditional setups take minutes to see changes. Edge Delivery updates in the blink of an eye. For AI agents that need frequent iteration to bridge the gap between an 80% solution and the 99% you'll actually deploy, this speed isn't just convenient - it's essential.
Enter Tom's Framework
Tom's been living this problem every day. What started as a simple observation - that developing complex components in Edge Delivery meant jumping between Google Sheets, GitHub, and a local dev server - turned into something bigger.
His framework, documented in The Edge Delivery Services Developer Dilemma and How One Framework Solved It, does three things that made me stop and say "well, that's brilliant":
Local-first development - no more context-switching hell
AI-native architecture - gives your favorite coding assistant full visibility into code, content, and data
Preserves what makes Edge Delivery fast - you still get those 100/100 Lighthouse scores
The architecture that AI dreams of (not the architecture that AI hallucinates of)
Remember what makes Edge Delivery special architecturally? We use HTML semantics natively, keep structures flat and simple, and make everything transparent and open source. Tom's framework doubles down on these principles.
Instead of fighting the platform to get sophisticated components, his dual-directory structure lets you:
Start simple (as always)
Switch to sophisticated when you need it
Have your AI assistant understand the full picture
Ready to See What's Possible?
For me, Tom's blog isn't just another technical post - it's a blueprint for pushing Edge Delivery further than most people thought possible.
The repository is live at on GitHub, and I can guarantee this: your next Edge Delivery project will be easier because of what Tom figured out here.
Check it out, drop thoughts in our Discord, and maybe we get Tom to join our next call to walk through it live.

Unlocking Efficiency with Helix 5: A Scalable Approach to Multi-Site Development
Imagine needing to launch four websites rapidly - while maintaining quality, consistency, and performance. One of our customers faced this exact challenge. They implemented AEM Edge Delivery Services (Helix 5), which enabled them to develop all four sites using a single codebase. This resulted in faster, more efficient deployment with reduced complications.
Why AEM Edge Delivery Services (Helix 5)?
Before Helix 5, teams managed multiple repositories, spreadsheets, and configuration files, creating complexity and inefficiency. The new approach provides a streamlined workflow for multiple websites under one flexible system.
One client needed to launch four websites with unique branding but shared core functionality. Using Helix 5, they utilized a single component library instead of building each site from scratch. This provided faster development, theme-based customization, cross-site consistency, and simpler maintenance. While traditional methods would have required months, the shared codebase approach launched all four websites much faster with fewer complications.
Key Differences from Helix 4
Previously, managing configuration elements for multiple websites meant dealing with scattered spreadsheets and YAML files, leading to complexity and inconsistency.
What Has Changed?
With Helix 5, everything is handled through the Admin API, streamlining updates and ensuring consistency across all sites.
Building Components: Keep It Simple
Developing components in Helix 5 is all about reusability and flexibility. Instead of building custom components for every project, you can create a single set of modular pieces that work across different sites.
Best Practices for Component Development
Use CSS variables for all customizable properties to ensure flexibility.
Avoid hardcoded values to maintain scalability and prevent future design limitations.
Organize components consistently with standard Edge Delivery Services structures—no need for overengineering.
Templates: Standardizing Layouts Without Extra Work
Templates help maintain a consistent look and feel across multiple pages.
Example: Article Page Templates
Instead of reinventing the wheel for each new site, Helix 5 lets teams create template-specific CSS and JS files that can be easily reused:
When multiple templates are needed, we simply add more folders within the templates directory. Each template folder includes its own CSS and JS file to define its design and behaviour. This approach ensures that all article pages have a uniform design, reducing design inconsistencies.
Applying a Template
Templates are assigned using metadata by simply specifying the template name in the Metadata table, meaning no extra coding is required.
Configuration Made Easy
With Helix 5, configurations are managed via the Admin API, eliminating the need for manual file updates.
Sample API Request:
GET https://admin.hlx.page/config/{org)/sites/{website).json
API Response Example:
Theming: Customization Without Chaos
Each website can have its own unique branding while still sharing a common structure.
Theme Structure
To manage multiple site themes, we use a structured approach:
The base styles define the general design, while theme-specific styles are stored in separate CSS files.
Applying a Theme
Each website's theme is assigned in the Metadata table, like this:
A function in scripts.js dynamically loads the corresponding CSS file based on the metadata:
Example of Themed Variables
Each theme defines the same CSS variable names but with different values:
Site 1 Theme Variables
Site 2 Theme Variables
By referencing these variables, components adapt automatically to the active theme:
This approach ensures components remain reusable and adaptable across different sites without requiring individual modifications. Because all components reference these variables, switching themes is effortless!
Final Thoughts
Helix 5 is more than just an upgrade—it’s a smarter way to build, scale, and maintain multiple websites efficiently.
What Makes It Stand Out?
Saves time by reusing components.
Improves code organization with a structured approach.
Reduces effort by simplifying site management.
Minimizes redundant code while allowing site-specific customization.
It represents a major leap forward for edge Delivery Services, enabling the use of a single codebase across multiple websites. By centralizing development into a shared component library, Helix 5 eliminates redundancy while supporting multiple themes and configurations. This structured approach significantly enhances efficiency, scalability, and maintainability in modern web development.
For teams looking to simplify their workflow without compromising on quality, Helix 5 is the way forward.

Bonjour! Hola! Hello! – Creating Multilingual Sites with Ease
For businesses looking to reach a broad audience or customer base, multilingual support is often an essential requirement. The dominant approach is often to create separate content and pathing for each region and language. On larger sites, however, this inevitably leads to an explosion of duplicated content, impacting SEO, user accessibility, and the effort needed by authors to manage and update content. Within this blog post, we’ll be looking at how Edge Delivery Services seeks to address these issues by minimizing the need for duplicate content using a combination of placeholders, indexes, sitemaps, and recommended content structuring practices.
Considering Languages & Regions in Content Structure
Before diving into how to best handle multilingual support, it’s important to consider that apart from differences in language, more sales-oriented sites often may have the added requirement of needing to support different markets/regions as well. The traditional approach is often to create a separate folder for each combination of region and language, leading to pathing like:
However, as discussed, our goal here is to reduce duplicate content. In the example above if Canada and the U.S. both contain the same English pages, then it makes little sense to host these under both paths. This often can alienate some users as well who may want to consume content in a language unsupported by that region ... say a French speaker in the U.S. region. Of course in cases where there is little overlap in content across regions or where each has different branding requirements this approach may still be best.
Where possible though we want to operate with a “language first” approach:
This ensures that only content that is regional needs be created separately. Referring again to our example above, if both the Canadian and U.S. versions of our site share the same “about-us” page then it makes sense to just have this live under:
https://<domain>/en/about-us
Similarly, it follows that the French version of this page can now be made available to all users regardless of region:
https://<domain>/fr/about-us
By using this approach we’ve removed the need to duplicate this page across both English regions while still allowing ourselves the option to create region-specific content. If our Canadian and U.S. regions sell different products for example, we can add that additional specificity to the URL for each and place these pages within regional sub-folders:
Link Rewriting
The unfortunate complication of this new URL structure is that we can’t rely on non-regional pages to link out to the correct regional ones. We'll need to instead leverage sessionStorage, localStorage, or cookies to track a user's region and set up a query index within each language folder and regional subfolder. For every link on a page, we search our user's captured region’s index to see if the links’ relative path exists there and update the link accordingly if it does. If it does not, we instead search through the language index and use the link there if it exists. Continuing with our example, if a U.S. user was to navigate to the “products” page from a non-regional page we would first look through:
https://<domain>/en/us/query-index.jsonSeeing that the links’ relative path is contained within the index (and therefore a regional page) we would then alter the link to point to:
https://<domain>/en/us/productsIf the regional content had not been found, we would have continued our search looking through:
https://<domain>/en/query-index.json
And likely linking to:
https://<domain>/en/products
Leveraging Placeholders for Translations in Code
For multilingual sites we obviously do not want to hard code any language specific strings, particularly on our blocks which are shared across all pages regardless of language. By taking advantage of Edge Delivery Service’s built in placeholders functionality and taking design cues from the previous section we can instead dynamically fetch the properly translated string value based on the pages' location, metadata, or the user’s selected language. Much like with our indexes we create a placeholders spreadsheet within each language folder and populate each with the same keys and their respective translated values. From our code we can now use the “fetchPlaceholders” function and dynamically pass in our captured language value like so:
As an example, let’s look at a basic countdown block which contains the following HTML:
And the related snippets from the placeholder spreadsheets for each language folder:
/en/placeholders.xlsx
/fr/placeholders.xlsx
As you can see by leveraging placeholders we’ve removed any language specific strings from our block code and instead reference shared keys, thereby ensuring we can use the same block anywhere on our site.
Without going into too much detail, you can imagine how this same concept could be applied to our regional folders to alter our code's behavior using placeholders across regions as well.
Content/Document Translation
Of course, having now covered how to handle translations within our code this brings up the question of how best to translate the content itself. Because Edge Delivery Services with document-based editing typically involves using Word, Google Docs, and spreadsheets, we have built in machine translation already available to us right out of the box. In addition, we can assume that nearly all third-party translation services will be able to seamlessly integrate with our choice of editor and content repository. This flexibility in tooling allows us to automate our translation process exactly how we’d like to, allowing for quick content creation within our language subfolders and in turn, across all our sites.
Improving SEO with Sitemaps
Now that we have set up our language specific folders, placeholders files, and query indexes we can now set up our sitemaps in an SEO friendly way. It is common to have sitemaps for each language, Edge Delivery Services supports multiple sitemaps and allows you to set their corresponding hreflang references. Following our example above we should now have both French and English language subfolders, each containing their own query index. In the root folder of our project we can create a file called “helix-sitemap.yaml” and populate it with the following:
This will generate a sitemap for each of our language subfolders based on the indexes we set up within each.
Alternative Configurations
This post only captures the setup of a standard multilingual site. There may be cases where your region/language requirements are entirely different or where your site typically caters to a specific audience, in which case that audience's language would be best placed at the root of the project with alternative languages being contained within subfolders.
For additional information please consult related AEM documentation covering translations, placeholders, and the query index.

How content is published from AEM Sites authoring to Edge Delivery Services
When using the Universal Editor to author AEM content, publishing is as simple as clicking the Publish button in the Universal Editor. Please see the document Publishing Content with the Universal Editor.
The flow of information when publishing is as follows. Once the author starts publication, this flow is automatic and is illustrated here for information purposes.
NOTE: Up to a maximum of 5000 paths published from the authoring UI or by workflows are permitted per day. Integrations that create bulk-publication work loads are not supported. If your project requires higher capacity, please propose it for the VIP Program.
The content author publishes AEM content in the Universal Editor.
A publish event is pushed to the Adobe pipeline queue.
The Edge Delivery Services publish service forwards the relevant events to Edge Delivery Services admin API.
Edge Delivery pulls and ingests semantic HTML from AEM author.
AEM is updated with publish status.
By default, the Edge Delivery Services admin API is not protected and can be used to publish or unpublish documents without authentication. In order to configure authentication for the admin API as documented in Configuring Authentication for Authors, your project must be provisioned with an API_KEY, which grants access to the publish service. Please reach out to the Adobe team on Slack for guidance.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 0
Introduction to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services
I discuss how Edge Delivery Services works with providers, focusing on Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.I create a Hello World block.
Back to Top
Introduction
I am a developer; arrays start at element 0, or I began writing with part 1 and now need an introduction. You choose.
This series of articles discusses developing with Adobe’s Edge Delivery Services in the Context of Document Authoring.
What is Document Authoring?
Creating and publishing content in the digital landscape involves multiple steps and stakeholders. Subject Matter Experts generate original content, which goes through an approval process. The approved content is then passed to Content Authors, who copy and paste sub-edited content into the Content Management System (CMS) for publishing. This process can be time-consuming, especially in regulated industries, where the approval process can take a long time.
Content Authors dislike CMS systems. They are forced to use “components” and “templates” created by technicians, using “page properties” and “dialog boxes” to pull the whole piece together; they have to sub-edit the copy because it often won’t fit in the constraints of the CMS. They usually have to backport the content to the original document format as a system of record. Returning the document to the SME with a link to the final web-page page.
Product Owners dislike CMS systems, especially in regulated industries. They must get approval for every line of text they place on the web. Regulated industries, like pharmaceuticals, automobile makers, insurers, etc., are legally bound by the content they publish and the corporation's stringent requirements. One product owner I know of asked that pre-approved Excel spreadsheets drive the entire CMS; however, the technicians have built the components and templates around dialogue boxes. He, too, had to use the copy-paste methodology.
Enter Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services from Adobe, sometimes called EDS. This system stands out for its innovative approach to web publishing and promises to redefine efficiency and simplicity in the industry.
It is a cutting-edge document-based CMS, named in tribute to Rosalind Franklin, whose work was crucial in deciphering DNA's structure. It has transformed from the "Helix" concept to the current "Edge Delivery Services," signifying its growth from a rudimentary tool to a comprehensive digital content management solution. It has shared all three names in its lifetime: Franklin, Helix and now Edge Delivery Services.

Weighing the Benefits and Limitations
Edge Delivery Services is designed to deliver content with unparalleled efficiency, addressing the challenges of handling extensive information without compromising performance. It opens the content management field to a broader audience, enabling more professionals to contribute effectively. However, it's essential to acknowledge that Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services may not be the one-size-fits-all solution for every scenario, mainly where intricate customization and deep content modelling and structuring are paramount. Edge Delivery Services offers deeper integration with traditional AEM for requests that require content modelling and deeper integration with the back-end. Adobe has you covered. Think of Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services as the rapid delivery of traditional documents - ‘a Content Marketing System’. When customers require more sophisticated back-ends, AEM Authoring with Edge Delivery Services is ready to take up the workload and continue to integrate with the document authoring solutions in place.
Is it Edge Delivery Service or Edge Delivery Services?
Good question. It is Edge Delivery Services, as many different services are involved in delivery at the Edge (close to the customer). There are asset services, authentication services, JSON services, content services, and CDN (Content Delivery Network) services. The Adobe-provided services run on ADOBE IO, a serverless environment.
Edge Delivery Services is the final publishing point; many projects provide content for this platform.
At the time of writing, there are three providers (in order of appearance):
gdocs2md (Google)
word2md (Microsoft)
html2md (Bring your own markup)
The last one supports:
Crosswalk, Commerce, and Dark Alley. Universal Editor is something that is sitting on top of Crosswalk (from the perspective of Edge Delivery Services)
Project Helix (which was later extended into Franklin) covers delivery, authoring (through Sidekick), and integration (through the Admin API). To refer to the Word and Google integration only as Helix isn't how the Adobe team has been looking at it - and still isn't, as they use Helix now to refer to the same core architecture.
Edge Delivery Services (for AEM Sites) includes only the delivery part, as far as the product is packaged. There is no official name for the whole stack.
This is a complex relationship, making discussion challenging. I will focus on Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.
Each provider creates digital entities that are stored in a content bus. This includes content from cloud-based sources, including code, assets, text, HTML, JSON and configuration data. The platform serves the content bus.
It is essential to keep these two entities separate in your mind. There are providers, and Edge Delivery Services is the platform.
Why invest in this technology?
Performance. Edge Delivery Services is faster, which increases customer engagement. There are lots of studies showing that speed counts. Adobe wants to create the world's fastest websites, so it experimented to see what would happen if all our customers had the world's fastest sites! So Adobe did this.
Surely a CDN does this for AEM?
It helps, but there is more than just CDN delivery. CDNs are great for global audiences, but users usually have multiple CDNs, dispatcher caches, Akamai, etc. Edge Delivery Services is not a CDN. It sits side by side, feeding one CDN! It runs next to your CDN, not in parallel.
What speed do we expect?
Lighthouse has its challenges. Edge Delivery Services sends pages optimally, not including any JS cumulative layout shift. If you get 100 on Lighthouse, you will be among the fastest in the world. Adobe aimed for 80-100 for Edge Delivery Services, and they achieved it.
Is this just for static content?
Great question. The magic is caused by rethinking resources, with a server component that organises the resources and a client part that personalises. Working together, these two parts allow super-fast dynamic page content. Adobe first focused on what was visible to the user, improving static and dynamic pages. There is no such thing as a static page in Edge Delivery Services.
Did Adobe create a new JS framework to do this?
Current front-end frameworks are designed around limitations in the stack, but browsers have improved, protocols have changed, HTTP/3 is available, and limitations are gone. So Adobe does not call what they are doing a “framework”; it is the web platform. Adobe uses the best bits from the new world. In the old world, software used a bundler to consume assets and placed it on a server for a client to consume. Edge Delivery Services is a no-bundler; source code coordination is used instead. The goal was to make Edge Delivery Services easy to use and make the time to rebuild a site super fast. Instead of incrementally adapting a site to a new design, authors use the tools they have learnt: Excel, Word, Google Drive, etc.
What does the platform bring?
Performance optimisation: Edge Delivery Services focuses heavily on web performance. It helps serve websites at lightning-fast speeds from edge locations (geographically closer to users) for lower loading times. Unmatched speed – get a Lighthouse reading of 100s.
Content at scale: It can handle thousands of pages. Adobe has 300,000+ pages on its website, as Edge Delivery Services pages.
Content first: Whether structured or unstructured, AEM prioritises your content, delivers it optimally, and provides your developers with everything they need to make it shine.
Enhanced developer experience: Edge Delivery Services empowers developers using modern front-end technologies and frameworks..
Real user monitoring (RUM) provides real-time performance metrics, so any dips or issues can be addressed quickly, maintaining a great user experience.
Flexibility: Edge Delivery Services is composable, meaning you can use only the specific services you need for your project. No matter where your data is, you can bring it into Edge Delivery Services.
Why Edge Delivery Services Matters
Website speed and user experience are crucial. Edge Delivery Services helps businesses achieve:
Faster time to market: Get content updates live much quicker. With its serverless, lightweight approach to web development, Edge Delivery Services allows you to go live in weeks, onboard new developers in days and iterate on changes in minutes. Unlimited preview sites give you confidence that changes will be what you need.
Improved SEO: Faster websites get a boost in search rankings.
Increased customer engagement: A smooth, fast website keeps users engaged, leading to potentially higher conversion rates.
Zero backend development: No building via Maven, Grunt, etc. Edge Delivery Services uses everything modern web developers love: GitHub, local development with auto-reload, performance, and simplicity. And none of the complications: no transpilation, no bundlers, no configurations, no overhead, no pipelines.
Low-code productivity: No frameworks, plain HTML, modern CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Simple to onboard devs: no backend (needs repeating!).
One less thing to be on call for. Incredible availability due to fully redundant architecture, endless scalability as a full software-as-a-service, and easy integrations with your existing CDN make go-live anxiety a thing of the past.
From Cedric Heusler: The short version is that we are building the “bottomless CMS” - a set of CMS services independent of the content. The content is either already in the cloud (SharePoint, etc.) or managed with a domain-specific workflow AND in a CMS. All this content comes together in the brand/enterprise experience.
How does Edge Delivery Services differ from AEM?
Unlike traditional content management systems (CMSs), this solution does not require a dedicated authoring or publishing environment. Instead, it leverages platforms like Google Drive or SharePoint to create and manage content published directly to Edge Delivery Services for fast and reliable delivery to end-users. This serverless approach eliminates the need for complex infrastructure and maintenance, making it a cost-effective and scalable option for content delivery.
Components can be used immediately as the pages have been built beforehand, eliminating the need to wait for a CDN call to the dispatcher or for the components to run on a publisher.
No bundling of JS/CSS (Clientlibs).
The code relies solely on modern JavaScript and CSS without needing external JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.
Pages are controlled through spreadsheets, redirects, indexes, and metadata, all converted into JSON by Edge Delivery Services.
Paths in Google Drive/SharePoint control the tree structure of pages.
Plug-in tools like Asset Picker from Adobe and Translate from Google can be used.
Developers store code in GitHub: no build to deploy.
Each branch in GitHub has a separate live preview.
Zero pipelines, no delay in publishing. Fast.
Did I say fast and easy using tools you already know?
To end this introduction, I must create a ‘hello world’ for Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.
Code is coordinated by scripts.js in the scripts folder.
You can see the code in scripts that control loading:
This pattern is known as E-L-D, Eager, Lazy, Delayed, which optimizes the page loading sequence to help us get to the 100/100/100/100 model.
Earlier in the sequence, scripts.js inspects the page held in the content bus and modified to be the intermediate state; the code scans for ‘blocks’ and when finding one, it injects the cs and javascript, executing the JS if any is placed in line.
Creating HelloWorld
I will assume that you have cloned the https://github.com/adobe/aem-boilerplate repo and setup your Edge Delivery Services folder following Getting Started – Developer Tutorial (www.aem.live)
To create a simple "Hello World" block in Edge Delivery Services, you'll need to create a CSS file for styling and a JavaScript file for functionality. Here's how you can do it:
Create a new folder named "helloworld" in your blocks directory in the GitHub repository
Create two files inside the "helloworld" folder: helloworld.css and helloworld.js.
In helloworld.css, add the following content:
In helloworld.js, add the following content:
In your Google document, insert a table, one cell wide and one cell deep.
In this cell, add the text ‘helloworld’
The existence of the table with the first cell name is the link to the code; Edge Delivery Services looks in the blocks folder and cell-name folder for similarly named js and css, applying the js and the css to the DOM. Magic completed, and the results look like this.

Introduction
This is a developer's guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. It assumes you have access to a content team to create the content.
I was only joking. Developers can type content.
This tutorial will guide you through creating your blocks and amending the HTML provided by Edge Delivery Services to ensure that the page has the look and feel you need, with coding examples.
Document-based authoring: Edge Delivery Services allows content creators to use familiar tools like Microsoft Word, Google Docs and spreadsheets to author and structure website content, greatly simplifying the process.
All work on a modern website starts with a product owner, a creative person who wants to describe a product or a service. A marketing lead often briefs the product owner. The initial stages usually start with a document, such as Word or Google Docs. The idea is fleshed out and spread around the various teams until everybody is happy with the outcome, messaging and possibly pricing. Sample images and other content are often embedded in the document.
This is then sent to the web content team, which will design a new web page in the site hierarchy or a landing page distinct from the rest of the website. Based on the document's contents, the team may have a design ready or commission one.
The team then copies and pastes the images and text from the document into ‘components’ placed on a ‘template’ within the CMS. Sometimes, they need to adjust the copy to fit the page template or component. When changes have been made, the copied and pasted text is placed back into the document as a system of record, and when the web page has been published, the amended document is sent back to the product owner.
This can be a long process. Perhaps templates and components need building from a busy dev team; the content team is busy creating the next season's campaigns; the author server is down for routine maintenance. The page may not need much design; it may be design-ready with known components, and you might have Franklin (Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services). Good. We will publish the page and step through the processes, adjusting code and styling.
If you do not have Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services installed, the tutorial at https://aem.live is easy to follow.
Beginning with a simple page,
We begin with a simple page, one with a simple title and simple text in Google Docs:
The document above is named Hello World, and the text states, “Hello World From Edge Delivery Services.” Pressing the Preview button transfers the document as HTML to Edge Delivery Services’ content bus, which stores all the content for the eventual web pages. We also have a code bus and an asset bus.
The system then creates a web page.
Not very complicated. Look at the ‘view page source’ code:
What happened?
The title, og:title and twitter:title were created from the first and only line in the text, and the canonical meta tag and the og:url were created from the page's location, formed by domain name/Google Drive location.
Also note that the domain name, in this case main--allaboutv2--ddttom was taken from my GitHub branch, repo name and username. If I created a new branch, say testing, then the domain name would change to testing--allaboutv2--ddttom. The double hyphens -- separate each element. This allows for the testing of new code without breaking the site.
A default image tag for og:image:secure_url, og:image and twitter:image has been provided. I must provide this default image in my codebase.
The viewport tag has been provided.
Finally, the scripts aem.js and scripts.js are loaded
I have an empty header and footer in my Franklin implementations. If one wants these to be present, one can create them in Google Drive, following similar rules to page creation.
The main part of the HTML is a div, followed by a paragraph and text. This is a very simple web page.
But what happens inside the browser?
You will see that the DOM has been adjusted or decorated. This is by design. Franklin provides the document in a raw HTML format with known patterns. It is up to the developers to shape the HTML to the end requirements.
Franklin has added the HTML to load our CSS through style sheets. Two different patterns are used: styles.css and lazy-style.css. As the document is processed, there are three phases: load-eager, load-page, and load-lazy. Load-eager gets the important “before the fold” stuff and everything needed to get the page set up as quickly as possible; load-page is our normal run-of-the-mill stuff, and load-lazy is for actions that don’t matter, such as animations. Further details will be provided later.
Franklin has injected extra scripts into the header, inspecting the raw HTML and deciding which components are used. In our case, we have a header and a footer (though both are blank). Franklin has decided that we are using the header and footer components. Franklin calls the components ‘blocks,’ so it adds the CSS to the DOM and runs the JS from the same folder.
.
We are using modern JavaScript techniques in Franklin, so the JavaScript is dynamically imported, similar to:
Although it uses a more elegant method.
The JavaScript that comes with the blocks can modify and shape the DOM to match the styling requirements. This is a more advanced technique that will be explained later.
The standard “out of the box” causes the body element to be non-displayed.
You should also note that we are using CSS3 variables in our CSS.
When the page is finally ready to be seen, the class “appear” is applied to the body, and the page becomes visible, thus stopping any flashes of unstyled content.
Semantic header and footer elements are added to the DOM, and wrappers are added as a class to each part. The document is split into sections, only one in this raw case. As the JS runs for each ‘block’ or ‘section’, a data-block-status or a section-block-status class with a value of “loaded” is added; this will help prevent this fraction of the DOM from being handled more than once. It's also a signal to the CSS to action new styles.
The raw line of text is given a <div class=”default-content-wrapper”>
In summary, Franklin applies clever conventions on top of the Google/Word Doc, sending minimal HTML to the browser with minimal JavaScript, preferably over an HTTP/3 channel. The JavaScript inspects the HTML and then decorates it by following rules.
We have yet to discover the rules in this document. As there is no configuration in the document, Franklin uses a technique known as auto-blocking, which uses ‘smart algorithms’ to understand the author's intent.
What’s this about rules?
Documents need descriptions, titles, etc. Franklin tries to provide them, but it would be better if the author had control. In document authoring, we use tables to give rules.
The image above shows our document with a table with two columns. The first row is merged and given the name ‘metadata’. This is the clue to Franklin to use this information to adjust the metadata in the HTML.
The left column contains the key phrase, and the right column contains the content. It is traditional to place this table at the foot of the document.
What this metadata does to our HTML
In this HTML, you can see that the title matches our title and that the description is mapped to the description fields in the og:description and twitter:description fields.
A new meta field has been added:
<meta name="keywords" content="Explanatory, web, page, hello, world">
This ability to add rules to the document is key to creating interesting web pages.
We can add one of the built-in rules. If they contain code and styling, they are called blocks.
Add a block called columns:
Now inspect the view page source. We will only look at <main> as we have not changed the metadata.
The block name (columns) is now held within a div element with a class of “columns.” This signals Franklin to adjust the DOM, as we will see later.
Although we used a table to define our block, Franklin used div elements to separate each cell. We have not gone back in time and are about to style tables. Franklin is much smarter than that.
Inspecting the rendered DOM, where .…. represents unchanged parts
The image in og:image and og:image:secure_url has been replaced from the default with the URL for the image in the metadata table.
This is our first time using an image in our sample document. You will notice that the doc format has embedded the image into the document, and its original name is lost. Franklin creates a unique ID. If the same image is used in multiple places, the ID is the same; it is a hash of the image. You will notice in the HTML a query string: ?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium"
The &#x26; is an HTML entity representing the ampersand character (&). It is inserted in the string to disambiguate the parameters. So, it states that the image should be resized to 1200 pixels in width and served as a progressive jpeg with medium optimisation. Noting this, it is best to provide an image 1200 pixels wide in the image metadata portion of the page. Franklin will stretch or shrink your image to fit if you do not.
We will add images to our simple website and see what Franklin offers later.
The CSS for columns has been added to the DOM:
At the same time as this decoration, the js in /blocks/columns/columns.js has been imported and executed.
A div with class=”columns-wrapper” has been added to the DOM just before the text.
The original div class = ”columns” has been extended, and new classes have been added: block to inform Franklin that this is a block and columns-2-cols to ensure that the correct styling for a two-column div is applied.
The code in column.js does this decoration to transform the raw HTML into a structure that can be styled.
The code above reads the number of divs in the first child and gets the count; it then adds the class with a count derived from the number of children.
The last part of the js looks for picture elements - added at the document level - and decorates the cell with columns-img-col if found.
Adjusting our document and placing the same image at the top of the page, with author details.
I have opened the image options panel in Google Drive to show the placement of alt text and title of this image. I am using the same image as I used in the metadata; we will be able to see the different treatments given to the image by Edge Delivery Services.
Preview the page in the browser.
Inspecting the view page source, from main onwards:
Keep in mind the original og:image metadata:
<meta property="og:image" content="https://main--allaboutv2--ddttom.hlx.page/media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpeg?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium">
The HTML provided shows that the picture element was used. The HTML picture element is a powerful tool for creating websites. It allows web developers to specify multiple image sources, ensuring the browser displays the most appropriate image for the user's device and network conditions. Additionally, the picture element provides a fallback mechanism for browsers not supporting it, ensuring users always see some form of the image.
The picture element constructed has the following pattern. I have abstracted the name and shortened the optimisation part to show the layout.
This element has media query conditions that choose the correct width for a mobile device (min-width:600). There are format options to choose WebP (format=webply) or JPEG (format=jpeg). The browser will use this mix to select the correct image for the viewport size and browser capabilities. Finally, there is a fallback - for browsers or tools that need help understanding the picture element (few these days).
Inspecting the HTML code reveals that the same image is used everywhere as the source. The query-string modifier changes what is served to the browser. In our case:./media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpeg
Creating a bio block
We will improve the content team's experience by creating a bio block and writing some JavaScript and CSS to add the image title as a byline for the bio. Search for the meta author if the image does not contain a title.
<meta name="author" content="Tom Cranstoun">
The first step is to extend the page metadata table to add a new entry: author. Remember, the first column is case-insensitive, but the second is not.
The next step is encapsulating the content in a new bio block and adding the text underneath.
Now, we must style the block and write the JavaScript to decorate it however we want.
Inspect the new block “bio” when looking at the view source page for the raw HTML:
We know that Edge Delivery Services decorates our block when it downloads; looking at the rendered DOM, just the bio block:
We see that the <div class=”bio”> has been replaced with<div class="bio-wrapper">
<div class="bio block" data-block-name="bio" data-block-status="loaded">
This allows us to target CSS onto the block.
We will put the bio picture into a circle.
The CSS styling is stored in /blocks/bio/bio.css
Developer Guide to document authoring with Edge Delivery Services
We now want to add some JavaScript to retrieve the alt text or, if not present, read the meta name=author content into a Javascript variable named author, using the variable to enhance the bio element display. The content team no longer need to write the author's name if the metadata is correct, either on the alt or the meta author tag.
Create the new \blocks\bio\bio.js
Previewing the page:
By adding classes, we can create variations of our block. We add extra names in brackets after the block's name. We now create a highlighted variation of the bio block.
We adjust our styling in \blocks\bio\bio.css
As we have the circle (border-radius….), the browser version now shows the image with a 2px blue border.
The ability to create many block variations is a powerful feature that can add visual interest and interactivity to a web page. Using styling and JavaScript introspection, unique and engaging blocks can be created.
Here are some examples of how styling and JavaScript introspection can be used to create block variations:
Styling:
Use different colours, fonts and sizes to create various visual styles.
Add borders, shadows and other effects to create depth and dimension.
Use CSS animations and transitions to create dynamic effects.

By combining styling and JavaScript introspection, blocks can be created that are visually appealing and interactive, creating a more engaging and enjoyable user experience.
Creating a hero block
A hero block, frequently called the hero image or hero banner, is crucial at the start of many web pages. This large, page-wide image is strategically positioned to capture the visitor's attention upon landing immediately.
We begin by inserting a table in the document. The first cell is named Hero, and the image is in the second cell.
When we preview this, the hero takes up the entire screen width.
Even when viewed on a mobile device, it looks good.
You may remember that Edge Delivery Services makes a fresh version at different resolutions (picture element, media-query), transforming JPEG into WebP format. This may distort the mobile view by crushing the pixels, giving you a fuzzy appearance.
You may want a different hero on a mobile, which is an editorial decision. The auto-scaled version of the desktop hero sometimes needs to be fixed for a mobile hero.
How do we do this? With a slight modification of the hero table and a bit of JavaScript.
Add a suitable mobile image in a two-cell wide table.
When this is previewed, we are shocked. It is not what we wanted. We ended up with the second image as the hero; the desktop image got lost.
Looking at the rendered HTML:
Add code to the hero block.
As expected, we see two picture elements. We need to decorate this part of the site to combine them. By convention, the first row is the desktop image, and the second is the mobile image.
We add code to the empty \blocks\hero\hero.js
The code performs manipulations on the picture elements. It starts by selecting two <picture> elements: the first one is located inside the first <div> element within an element with the class name hero, and the second one is located inside the second <div> element within the first <div> element of the hero class.
If both these <picture> elements exist, the code proceeds to do the following:
1. It selects the second <source> element from the second <picture> element.
2. If the second <source> element exists, it creates a copy of it.
3. It then checks if the first <picture> element has a second <source> element.
If it does, the code replaces the existing second <source> element in the first <picture> element with the copied <source> element from the second <picture> element.
If it doesn't, the code adds the copied <source> element as a new child of the first <picture> element.
4. Finally, the code removes the document's second <picture> element.
If only one picture element exists, the code does nothing, and the hero still works.
Just a little touch of magic.
See the screenshots below:
Desktop image
Mobile image
Finally, the rendered picture elements - following the adjustments:
The two picture elements have been merged into one.
All this work has been done without affecting the Lighthouse page speed.
If you follow along, you will have a very similar page. See here An explanatory web page

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 2
Creating variations of our block
Automating Author Name from Alt Text
Place text to the right of BIO
Use of fragments
Theming
This post continues my Developer’s guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.
Previously
We created a Google Doc called ‘Hello World’. It has a hero and a bio block, with the line of text “Hello World From Edge Delivery Services.”
We added a metadata table at the bottom of the document, and the entries became metadata on the final web page.
We added JavaScript to the hero block to allow the hero to contain two distinct images: one for mobile and one for desktop. The picture element selected these depending on the viewport size. We created the bio block from scratch, with styling to create a circular overlay and to pick up the author's name from either the alt tag in the img element and, if not present, obtain the author’s name from the author meta element from the page. We added a class name ‘highlighted’ to our Bio block and the CSS to put an outline on the image.
Continuing the journey
Our manager has asked that we follow the image with some text with brief biographical details, including the author's name. Thus, we no longer need the author's name automatically provided underneath the picture. This is another variation.
The cell in the block name is currently Bio (highlighted). The word bio is the block name and also the class name used to create the element and its wrappers; looking at the rendered HTML in the browser after Edge Delivery Services has run, one of the first things to note is that the blocks we created have been rendered in a div with a section class.
<div class="section hero-container bio-container columns-container" data-section-status="loaded" style="">
The div also has classes for each block in the document, postfixed with -container. There is a data-section-status class that is adjusted by edge delivery and, finally, an empty style; we will return to section styles later. Further down, we see the bio-block
In the snippet of HTML, the block is decorated with a -wrapper <div class="bio-wrapper">, and the next div is decorated with the block name ‘bio’ and the variation ‘highlighted’ along with a ‘block’ class.
<div class="bio highlighted block" data-block-name="bio" data-block-status="loaded">
All blocks are decorated this way: block name, variations applied and then ‘block’. This makes it easy to target slices of the HTML using classes; Edge Delivery Services does not use IDs.
Hiding the auto-generated author-name
Our task is to hide the author, so adding a new class name, “hide author”, is done by adding a second phrase after a comma within the brackets. All spaces in the block/styling phrase are replaced with hyphens (-)
Investigating the rendered HTML.
We can adjust the CSS or JS to make this class work. I chose to adjust the javascript, adding a test for the non-existence of the class ‘hide-author.’
The final Javascript function
Place the text to the right.
The next task was to allow text to the right of our bio picture. Insert a new column, merge the title and add the text.
Previewing could be better; the text is underneath.
It looks OK, but we wanted something else. We want the text to be to the right. Adding CSS to bio.css to involve a flex layout does the trick.
We adjusted the first and last child of the DIVs to make it work
Reusing content
Content Management Systems often reuse pieces of text and assets; Edge Delivery Services include this functionality; these are called fragments.
I create fragments in a folder called fragments in my Google Drive. We want boilerplate text at the foot of our pages, similar to the ‘Want to know more’ at the bottom of these articles.
We create the fragment.
And add the content
We need to include this fragment in our page by adding a fragment block with the path of the fragment.
When previewed, we can now see the fragment on our page.
The ‘want to know more’ fragment is displayed on the page; it is interesting to see how Edge Delivery Services provides this snippet; we inspect the network traffic.
This time, you can see the fetch/xhr content in my filter, and the fragment component asked for want-to-know-more-plain.html instead of Edge Delivery providing a page with styling, javascript, <body>, <main>, etc.; it just provided the raw HTML in a div ready for adding to the page; where it will inherit the styling and context of the page.
Looking more carefully, you wiil also see footer.plain.html and nav.plain.html
These are ‘auto fragments’ generated from the footer and nav documents placed in the root folder of Google Drive. This gives the website a consistent set of headers and footers.
I want my allabout.network to be focussed on telling people ‘all about’ something, such as this tutorial, without third-party distractions. Therefore, I have also chosen not to have footers or navigation; you can easily create your navigation and footers and have them auto-included as fragments.
Styling the pages
There are three ways to style your pages.
Use the default autoblock style.
Change nothing; get the style verbatim from styles.css. You can view and change the styles in styles.css for your project. Note that the style sheets in Edge Delivery use CSS 3 with variables; it does not require bundling, compiling, or transpilation.
Use a theme
After applying the theme's name to your metadata table, Edge Delivery Services will apply the theme class to the body. Then, you can change the styling for this page using the theme as a modifier; for instance, a newsletter page could have a theme of ‘newsletter’; as I am writing an article, I will give this page a theme of ‘article’.
Edge Delivery Services applies the theme class to the body element.
One can use different styles on this page, such as margin padding.
Note that the body class has a display: none; when Edge Delivery finishes loading the page, it changes the display attribute by adding a class “appear” with a display “block”
Use sections
Sections are parts of the page; they are marked by ‘---’ 3 hyphens on a line by themselves and have a section metadata table.
Preview the page
The rendered HTML for a section looks like this:
The description metadata is used as a data-description attribute in the section div. You can use these data descriptions to decorate the HTML further, but this will be custom code.
The Hello World page is here.https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/hello-world-2

Everything discussed below is identical if you have an existing Word or Google Doc. I will demonstrate importing an existing web page into the system.
Consider a web page such as
The AI Tipping Point: A Consultant's Takeaways from CMS Kickoff 2024 | CMS Critic
If we want to convert this page to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services, we start with the AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) import command. The importer is currently named Franklin Import UI. Franklin is one of the internal product names; another used in the codebase is Helix. Helix refers to the DNA spiral and is used as a meme throughout the documentation and developer “getting started “ site: https://www.aem.live/home
I will continue to user Franklin in this document.
The Edge Delivery Services platform provides the security, scalability, and speed that Adobe offers for websites. Franklin is an individual project that utilizes the Edge Delivery Services content bus.The platform also includes other projects discussed in a separate blog post.
The importer reads the website and recognises the main content, removing the adverts. It then saves the content as a Word document. We edit the document to remove the menu hangover in Word or Google Docs and add a heading title format. That's all we have to do. The document is ready for Edge Delivery Services.
Upload to Google Drive (or SharePoint)
In Google Drive (or SharePoint), we can use the document's normal workflows, plugins, and tools, including translation, AI content enhancement, etc.
When we are ready, press Preview to check the website. Then press Publish, and the web page will be complete and ready for the public.
This technique is called ‘autoblocking’ in the Franklin project. We have not created any components, added fancy tags, or used JavaScript Blocks on the web page. We have taken a basic article with images and turned it into a reasonable web page. Franklin has preserved font emboldening, heading levels, and links and loosely styled them all, which Edge Delivery Services will serve fast.
Franklin understands the document's headings (h1, h2, etc.) and applies these values to the final web page. Franklin also understands bold, italic, and underlining. Franklin understands the Courier font as a code marker and outputs the content raw, without font decoration.
Adding new items
We want to be creative and add new items to our site. Let's explain how that works.
In the GitHub repository, we store individual code and styling in blocks. Your developers take care of these, and your integrator or developer team will provide some additional blocks.
When applying code or styling to a fraction of our web page, one adds a table with the block's name. Let’s add a centreblock:
This text will be centred on the web page. That’s all we have to do. If we wanted to do more, we could have various code and styling blocks, say, accordions, tabs, etc.
Many out-of-the-box blocks are available for Franklin; see Block Collection.Further down the page, you will see Block Party.
One can add teasers, heroes, accordions, tabs, etc. Your developers can create many more.
Metadata
Another feature of Franklin is a special block embedded in the HTML page containing the content and the values to be used as metadata. This block describes the page to external systems and configures the page for the Franklin project.
In each row below, the first column is the metadata keyword, and the second column is the value of the metadata element. We have multiple items: one for the page title, one for the page description; one for an image, and one for a line of extra data. The case is ignored in the first column. The metadata table is typically placed at the foot of the document, though this is not a requirement.
This metadata translates into the final HTML
I will cover metadata in detail in the developer's guide. It's good to know that Franklin covers metadata, that it is easily maintained by the content team, and that it may be used by Google or other indexers. Franklin may also use the metadata to change the page layout.
Preview and publish
Franklin contains a toolbar that allows authorised users to preview or publish pages via the Edge Delivery Services platform.
Pressing Preview allows the content author to see the final page, and then pressing Publish sends the page and its assets—the content, media, and code buses—to the public store.
The publish bus system stores the various elements of the web page in a publicly visible cloud storage system where the code bus provides the final code needed to serve the web page to the public. The Adobe code in the code bus is started by a JavaScript file embedded in the HTML, named aem.js. This orchestrates the delivery and sequencing of the assets, the other code blocks and only the blocks required for the current page. This is a speedy delivery, made faster by a bring-your-own CDN such as Fastly.
The assets bus provides images in a suitably rendered format using HTML picture elements, keeping the website fast and performant on mobile websites.
A properly implemented Edge Delivery Services page should have a great Core Web Vitals or Lighthouse score.Lighthouse performance scoring | Chrome for Developers
The Lighthouse score for this page is below:
The great score 100/100/100/100 comes out of the box. As you add scripts, especially third-party or monitoring scripts, you must continually monitor the performance to ensure the site performs as expected. Adobe provides great tools in the Franklin ecosystem, such as real user monitoring (RUM) and performance checks on GitHub. It helps you ensure you keep world-class speeds. Any Lighthouse score above 80 is at the top of the web.

Introduction
This is a developer's guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. It assumes you have access to a content team to create the content.
I was only joking. Developers can type content.
This tutorial will guide you through creating your blocks and amending the HTML provided by Edge Delivery Services to ensure that the page has the look and feel you need, with coding examples.
Document-based authoring: Edge Delivery Services allows content creators to use familiar tools like Microsoft Word, Google Docs and spreadsheets to author and structure website content, greatly simplifying the process.
All work on a modern website starts with a product owner, a creative person who wants to describe a product or a service. A marketing lead often briefs the product owner. The initial stages usually start with a document, such as Word or Google Docs. The idea is fleshed out and spread around the various teams until everybody is happy with the outcome, messaging and possibly pricing. Sample images and other content are often embedded in the document.
This is then sent to the web content team, which will design a new web page in the site hierarchy or a landing page distinct from the rest of the website. Based on the document's contents, the team may have a design ready or commission one.
The team then copies and pastes the images and text from the document into ‘components’ placed on a ‘template’ within the CMS. Sometimes, they need to adjust the copy to fit the page template or component. When changes have been made, the copied and pasted text is placed back into the document as a system of record, and when the web page has been published, the amended document is sent back to the product owner.
This can be a long process. Perhaps templates and components need building from a busy dev team; the content team is busy creating the next season's campaigns; the author server is down for routine maintenance. The page may not need much design; it may be design-ready with known components, and you might have Franklin (Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services). Good. We will publish the page and step through the processes, adjusting code and styling.
If you do not have Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services installed, the tutorial at https://aem.live is easy to follow.
Beginning with a simple page,
We begin with a simple page, one with a simple title and simple text in Google Docs:
The document above is named Hello World, and the text states, “Hello World From Edge Delivery Services.” Pressing the Preview button transfers the document as HTML to Edge Delivery Services’ content bus, which stores all the content for the eventual web pages. We also have a code bus and an asset bus.
The system then creates a web page.
Not very complicated. Look at the ‘view page source’ code:
What happened?
The title, og:title and twitter:title were created from the first and only line in the text, and the canonical meta tag and the og:url were created from the page's location, formed by domain name/Google Drive location.
Also note that the domain name, in this case main--allaboutv2--ddttom was taken from my GitHub branch, repo name and username. If I created a new branch, say testing, then the domain name would change to testing--allaboutv2--ddttom. The double hyphens -- separate each element. This allows for the testing of new code without breaking the site.
A default image tag for og:image:secure_url, og:image and twitter:image has been provided. I must provide this default image in my codebase.
The viewport tag has been provided.
Finally, the scripts aem.js and scripts.js are loaded
I have an empty header and footer in my Franklin implementations. If one wants these to be present, one can create them in Google Drive, following similar rules to page creation.
The main part of the HTML is a div, followed by a paragraph and text. This is a very simple web page.
But what happens inside the browser?
You will see that the DOM has been adjusted or decorated. This is by design. Franklin provides the document in a raw HTML format with known patterns. It is up to the developers to shape the HTML to the end requirements.
Franklin has added the HTML to load our CSS through style sheets. Two different patterns are used: styles.css and lazy-style.css. As the document is processed, there are three phases: load-eager, load-page, and load-lazy. Load-eager gets the important “before the fold” stuff and everything needed to get the page set up as quickly as possible; load-page is our normal run-of-the-mill stuff, and load-lazy is for actions that don’t matter, such as animations. Further details will be provided later.
Franklin has injected extra scripts into the header, inspecting the raw HTML and deciding which components are used. In our case, we have a header and a footer (though both are blank). Franklin has decided that we are using the header and footer components. Franklin calls the components ‘blocks,’ so it adds the CSS to the DOM and runs the JS from the same folder.
.
We are using modern JavaScript techniques in Franklin, so the JavaScript is dynamically imported, similar to:
Although it uses a more elegant method.
The JavaScript that comes with the blocks can modify and shape the DOM to match the styling requirements. This is a more advanced technique that will be explained later.
The standard “out of the box” causes the body element to be non-displayed.
You should also note that we are using CSS3 variables in our CSS.
When the page is finally ready to be seen, the class “appear” is applied to the body, and the page becomes visible, thus stopping any flashes of unstyled content.
Semantic header and footer elements are added to the DOM, and wrappers are added as a class to each part. The document is split into sections, only one in this raw case. As the JS runs for each ‘block’ or ‘section’, a data-block-status or a section-block-status class with a value of “loaded” is added; this will help prevent this fraction of the DOM from being handled more than once. It's also a signal to the CSS to action new styles.
The raw line of text is given a <div class=”default-content-wrapper”>
In summary, Franklin applies clever conventions on top of the Google/Word Doc, sending minimal HTML to the browser with minimal JavaScript, preferably over an HTTP/3 channel. The JavaScript inspects the HTML and then decorates it by following rules.
We have yet to discover the rules in this document. As there is no configuration in the document, Franklin uses a technique known as auto-blocking, which uses ‘smart algorithms’ to understand the author's intent.
What’s this about rules?
Documents need descriptions, titles, etc. Franklin tries to provide them, but it would be better if the author had control. In document authoring, we use tables to give rules.
The image above shows our document with a table with two columns. The first row is merged and given the name ‘metadata’. This is the clue to Franklin to use this information to adjust the metadata in the HTML.
The left column contains the key phrase, and the right column contains the content. It is traditional to place this table at the foot of the document.
What this metadata does to our HTML
In this HTML, you can see that the title matches our title and that the description is mapped to the description fields in the og:description and twitter:description fields.
A new meta field has been added:
<meta name="keywords" content="Explanatory, web, page, hello, world">
This ability to add rules to the document is key to creating interesting web pages.
We can add one of the built-in rules. If they contain code and styling, they are called blocks.
Add a block called columns:
Now inspect the view page source. We will only look at <main> as we have not changed the metadata.
The block name (columns) is now held within a div element with a class of “columns.” This signals Franklin to adjust the DOM, as we will see later.
Although we used a table to define our block, Franklin used div elements to separate each cell. We have not gone back in time and are about to style tables. Franklin is much smarter than that.
Inspecting the rendered DOM, where .…. represents unchanged parts
The image in og:image and og:image:secure_url has been replaced from the default with the URL for the image in the metadata table.
This is our first time using an image in our sample document. You will notice that the doc format has embedded the image into the document, and its original name is lost. Franklin creates a unique ID. If the same image is used in multiple places, the ID is the same; it is a hash of the image. You will notice in the HTML a query string: ?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium"
The &#x26; is an HTML entity representing the ampersand character (&). It is inserted in the string to disambiguate the parameters. So, it states that the image should be resized to 1200 pixels in width and served as a progressive jpeg with medium optimisation. Noting this, it is best to provide an image 1200 pixels wide in the image metadata portion of the page. Franklin will stretch or shrink your image to fit if you do not.
We will add images to our simple website and see what Franklin offers later.
The CSS for columns has been added to the DOM:
At the same time as this decoration, the js in /blocks/columns/columns.js has been imported and executed.
A div with class=”columns-wrapper” has been added to the DOM just before the text.
The original div class = ”columns” has been extended, and new classes have been added: block to inform Franklin that this is a block and columns-2-cols to ensure that the correct styling for a two-column div is applied.
The code in column.js does this decoration to transform the raw HTML into a structure that can be styled.
The code above reads the number of divs in the first child and gets the count; it then adds the class with a count derived from the number of children.
The last part of the js looks for picture elements - added at the document level - and decorates the cell with columns-img-col if found.
Adjusting our document and placing the same image at the top of the page, with author details.
I have opened the image options panel in Google Drive to show the placement of alt text and title of this image. I am using the same image as I used in the metadata; we will be able to see the different treatments given to the image by Edge Delivery Services.
Preview the page in the browser.
Inspecting the view page source, from main onwards:
Keep in mind the original og:image metadata:
<meta property="og:image" content="https://main--allaboutv2--ddttom.hlx.page/media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpeg?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium">
The HTML provided shows that the picture element was used. The HTML picture element is a powerful tool for creating websites. It allows web developers to specify multiple image sources, ensuring the browser displays the most appropriate image for the user's device and network conditions. Additionally, the picture element provides a fallback mechanism for browsers not supporting it, ensuring users always see some form of the image.
The picture element constructed has the following pattern. I have abstracted the name and shortened the optimisation part to show the layout.
This element has media query conditions that choose the correct width for a mobile device (min-width:600). There are format options to choose WebP (format=webply) or JPEG (format=jpeg). The browser will use this mix to select the correct image for the viewport size and browser capabilities. Finally, there is a fallback - for browsers or tools that need help understanding the picture element (few these days).
Inspecting the HTML code reveals that the same image is used everywhere as the source. The query-string modifier changes what is served to the browser. In our case:./media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpeg
Creating a bio block
We will improve the content team's experience by creating a bio block and writing some JavaScript and CSS to add the image title as a byline for the bio. Search for the meta author if the image does not contain a title.
<meta name="author" content="Tom Cranstoun">
The first step is to extend the page metadata table to add a new entry: author. Remember, the first column is case-insensitive, but the second is not.
The next step is encapsulating the content in a new bio block and adding the text underneath.
Now, we must style the block and write the JavaScript to decorate it however we want.
Inspect the new block “bio” when looking at the view source page for the raw HTML:
We know that Edge Delivery Services decorates our block when it downloads; looking at the rendered DOM, just the bio block:
We see that the <div class=”bio”> has been replaced with<div class="bio-wrapper">
<div class="bio block" data-block-name="bio" data-block-status="loaded">
This allows us to target CSS onto the block.
We will put the bio picture into a circle.
The CSS styling is stored in /blocks/bio/bio.css
Developer Guide to document authoring with Edge Delivery Services
We now want to add some JavaScript to retrieve the alt text or, if not present, read the meta name=author content into a Javascript variable named author, using the variable to enhance the bio element display. The content team no longer need to write the author's name if the metadata is correct, either on the alt or the meta author tag.
Create the new \blocks\bio\bio.js
Previewing the page:
By adding classes, we can create variations of our block. We add extra names in brackets after the block's name. We now create a highlighted variation of the bio block.
We adjust our styling in \blocks\bio\bio.css
As we have the circle (border-radius….), the browser version now shows the image with a 2px blue border.
The ability to create many block variations is a powerful feature that can add visual interest and interactivity to a web page. Using styling and JavaScript introspection, unique and engaging blocks can be created.
Here are some examples of how styling and JavaScript introspection can be used to create block variations:
Styling:
Use different colours, fonts and sizes to create various visual styles.
Add borders, shadows and other effects to create depth and dimension.
Use CSS animations and transitions to create dynamic effects.

By combining styling and JavaScript introspection, blocks can be created that are visually appealing and interactive, creating a more engaging and enjoyable user experience.
Creating a hero block
A hero block, frequently called the hero image or hero banner, is crucial at the start of many web pages. This large, page-wide image is strategically positioned to capture the visitor's attention upon landing immediately.
We begin by inserting a table in the document. The first cell is named Hero, and the image is in the second cell.
When we preview this, the hero takes up the entire screen width.
Even when viewed on a mobile device, it looks good.
You may remember that Edge Delivery Services makes a fresh version at different resolutions (picture element, media-query), transforming JPEG into WebP format. This may distort the mobile view by crushing the pixels, giving you a fuzzy appearance.
You may want a different hero on a mobile, which is an editorial decision. The auto-scaled version of the desktop hero sometimes needs to be fixed for a mobile hero.
How do we do this? With a slight modification of the hero table and a bit of JavaScript.
Add a suitable mobile image in a two-cell wide table.
When this is previewed, we are shocked. It is not what we wanted. We ended up with the second image as the hero; the desktop image got lost.
Looking at the rendered HTML:
Add code to the hero block.
As expected, we see two picture elements. We need to decorate this part of the site to combine them. By convention, the first row is the desktop image, and the second is the mobile image.
We add code to the empty \blocks\hero\hero.js
The code performs manipulations on the picture elements. It starts by selecting two <picture> elements: the first one is located inside the first <div> element within an element with the class name hero, and the second one is located inside the second <div> element within the first <div> element of the hero class.
If both these <picture> elements exist, the code proceeds to do the following:
1. It selects the second <source> element from the second <picture> element.
2. If the second <source> element exists, it creates a copy of it.
3. It then checks if the first <picture> element has a second <source> element.
If it does, the code replaces the existing second <source> element in the first <picture> element with the copied <source> element from the second <picture> element.
If it doesn't, the code adds the copied <source> element as a new child of the first <picture> element.
4. Finally, the code removes the document's second <picture> element.
If only one picture element exists, the code does nothing, and the hero still works.
Just a little touch of magic.
See the screenshots below:
Desktop image
Mobile image
Finally, the rendered picture elements - following the adjustments:
The two picture elements have been merged into one.
All this work has been done without affecting the Lighthouse page speed.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 3
Spreadsheets
Indexing
Spreadsheets and Json
Query parameters
Redirects
.helix folder
This is part 3 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.
Previously
We extended ‘Hello World’ with style variations on the bio block, added fragments, and discussed styling in more depth.
Next - We can use spreadsheets, not just documents.
Within Google Drive or Sharepoint, you can upload or create spreadsheets in Excel or Google Sheets format. If you are using Google Drive, remember to change your settings to convert Excel to Google Sheets automatically,How to Convert Multiple Word Documents/Sheets to Google Docs.
Using spreadsheets
Spreadsheets are versatile tools that can be used for various purposes. In this post, we will explore some of the most common uses for spreadsheets, including:
Source of JSON for your website: Spreadsheets can create JSON data that populates Edge Delivery Services pages or another website using ‘headless technologies’ such as react.js. They are a convenient way to store and manage data that needs to be displayed on a website.
Notification of events from Edge Delivery Services: Spreadsheets can be used to receive notifications of events from Edge Delivery Services. This can be useful for monitoring your website's performance or troubleshooting issues. The Spreadsheets created can be used on your website; we will demo this.
Configuration of Edge Delivery Services: Spreadsheets can be used to configure Edge Delivery Services. This optimises your website's performance or enables specific features like headers, metadata, and authentication.
1 Use a spreadsheet as a source of JSON for websites.
One can create a spreadsheet in MS Excel and upload it to Google Drive or create one directly inside Google Drive. For the demo, we will create a fortune cookie block in our document that displays a random cookie from a JSON file named cookies.
In Google Drive, create a folder named /data; in that folder, create a sheet named cookies.
The first row of the sheet becomes the json attribute names.
We now want a list of cookies, and I will get chatGPT to give me a list of 9
Press the preview button in the sidekick to see a nice json layout; I use json view.
Investigating the structure of the json.
The JSON structure consists of an object with several properties:
1. "total": A number representing the total count of data elements.
2. "offset": A number indicating the starting position of the data subset.
3. "limit": A number specifying the maximum number of data elements in this subset.
4. "data": An array containing the actual data elements. Each element is an object with two properties:
- "key": A string representing the message's short title
- "value": A string containing the actual message.
5. ":type": A string indicating the type of data, in this case, "sheet", the source of the data
In simple terms:
- The object has metadata about the data set, including the total number of elements, the offset and limit for this subset of data (useful for pagination), and the data type.
- The actual data is in the "data" array.
All JSON derived from spreadsheets in Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services share the same formatting; the main json is in the ‘data’ element, and everything else is metadata.
We would like to build a fortune cookie block.
Start by creating a table ‘FortuneCookie’ in our Hello World document.
Remember that the name cell, the only cell in the case above, is changed to lowercase when used in Edge Delivery Services.
In our GitHub, we need to createblocks/fortunecookie/fortunecookie.css and
blocks/fortunecookie/fortunecookie.js
The code in fortunecookie.js will use the browser's fetch command to read the json, generate a random number, use that number to pluck a key and a value, and then place the results in the block.
Viewing the page
We now have a Fortune Cookie on our page. You can add any JSON to your pages by using spreadsheets when someone presses preview and publish.
Spreadsheets and JSON
In addition to translating Google Docs and Word documents into markdown and HTML markup, AEM also translates spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel workbooks and Google Sheets) into JSON files that your website or web application can easily consume.
This enables many uses for content that is table-oriented or structured.
Sheets and Sheet Structure.
The simplest example of a sheet consists of a table that uses the first row as column names and the subsequent rows as data, as seen above.
Edge Delivery Services allows you to manage workbooks with multiple sheets.
If there is only one sheet, Edge Delivery Services will use that sheet as the default source of information.
Edge Delivery Services will only deliver sheets with sheet names prefixed with helix if there are multiple sheets. This lets you keep additional information and possibly formulas in the same spreadsheet that will not be delivered to the web.
If there is a sheet named helix-default, it is delivered if no additional query parameters are supplied.
See the following for details on how to query a specific sheet.
Query Parameters
Offset and Limit
Spreadsheets and JSON files can become very large. In such cases, Edge Delivery Services supports limit and offset query parameters to indicate which spreadsheet rows are delivered.
As Edge Delivery Services always compresses the JSON, payloads are generally relatively small. Therefore, if the limit query parameter is not specified, the Edge Delivery Services limits the number of rows it returns to 1000 by default. This is sufficient for many simple cases.
Sheet
The sheet query parameter allows an application to specify one or multiple specific sheets in the spreadsheet or workbook. For example,?sheet=jobs will return the sheet named helix-jobs, and ?sheet=jobs&sheet=articles will return the data for helix-jobs and helix-articles.
2 Notification of events from Edge Delivery Services
The empty sheet
Edge Delivery Services keeps a json index of all published pages; in Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services, you can have a copy of this index by creating a sheet in the root folder of your document store. This sheet must be named query-index and have a single sheet named raw_index. The columns are path, title, image, description and lastmodified. You can choose to add others like ‘author’. See indexing
When you publish a page, Edge Delivery automatically enters it into this spreadsheet with updated attributes and publishes the sheet. It's a two-way traffic sheet.
Using this documentation website as an example
And when we preview
This json file can be used in Edge Delivery Services to create dynamic blocks, where the content is pulled from a json file.
Creating a BlogList, using index-query.json
We added a bloglist block to the document.
We will create the bloglist code at
/blocks/bloglist/bloglist.css and/blocks/bloglist/bloglist.js
Bloglist Javascript
The javascript will also use fetch, which is similar to the fortunecookie block. We want to obtain the json, restrict it to just my blogs, sort by title, and then restrict the final json to three entries. You can see four entries in the sample above.
Create the BlogList style
Previewing the page
3 Configuring Edge Delivery Services
Edge Delivery Services is controlled in many ways; spreadsheets are the content Author-friendly way of performing this task.
Redirects
You have seen that we created a query-index sheet in our root folder. This is a two-way sheet that receives information from the publishing process and can be used to create dynamic content for your pages.
Edge Delivery Services also has a sheet named redirects, which creates the json entity redirects.json
In this sheet, we have two columns: Source and Destination.
I made the mistake of creating my blogs in the root folder of my Google Drive, and I did not similarly name them, so I moved them to a subtree ‘/blogs/ddt’ and created the redirects sheet in the root of the folder.
I also deleted the original pages, so you are redirected to the new destination when you ask for the older location: nice one, Adobe. Thinking about your hierarchy before you begin is preferable, but knowing that you can change it afterwards is nice.
The .helix folder
You can control the inner workings of Edge Delivery services using the folder named .helix
Note the ‘.’ -- it is dot-helix .helix
Note the name is a previous code name for this technology. The dot in front makes this folder unservable from the internet, which is excellent for secrets like how you are configuring Edge Delivery Services. You could think of the ‘.’ as just like the dot in Unix -- files are hidden!!
Anyway, the files you create in this folder are used for configuring Helix
Headers
The sheet ‘headers’, which in turn ought to create headers,json - you cannot see this file, contains the key and value of the headers you want to send out with your web pages.
My headers contain a content security policy, which helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.Link to CSP Description on Mozilla
Bringing up the sidekick
When you click on preview, instead of a new set of options, including publish, you get a transient sign ‘Configuration successfully activated’.
Because this is in the .helix folder, it does not need publishing -- it is not visible to the internet.
Config
The next sheet to look at is config; you put interesting things here for your configuration.
Part of mine is shown below; keys and secrets are here to configure CDN and caching; you can also configure authentication. I will not show you my samples for the obvious reasons.
You can find more info about the ‘.helix’ folder and metadata config here.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 4
Building an SPA app with Json
This is part 4 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. This time, we will create an SPA app.
Previously
We demonstrated how spreadsheets can serve as a JSON source for websites and Edge Delivery Services, as well as for notifications and configuration purposes.
Part 4 - Building an App with Json
I will first create an application in Edge Delivery Services and then extend this to a React application. Edge Delivery Services supports react and vue; one does not get the perfect 100,100,100,100 lighthouse scoring when we move to Single Page Applications (SPAs), though we get enhanced user interactions. This article shows how Edge Delivery Services can assist customers in building the best of both worlds. Architects should ensure that the home, campaign, and direct landing pages are built with pure Edge Delivery Services code; secondary pages can be more interactive, keeping the website's performance high. Like all rules, you can choose to disregard this one.
The app we build will demonstrate that Edge Delivery Services is not just for static pages.
Specification of the App
The app is a slideshow designed for content authors who create individual pages.
In a ‘traditional CMS, ’ this would probably be a pool of images in an extendable component, which is difficult for a content author to use. We will build a design focused on the content author.
Each page will also serve as a standalone entity, with a visually appealing slide image complemented by detailed textual content. The code's primary objective is to extract metadata from each page, represented as a JSON object. This metadata is then employed to showcase the slides in a continuous scrolling format, providing users with an immersive experience; each slide is linked to its corresponding page, enabling seamless navigation for users seeking additional information or exploring the content in greater depth.This feature enhances the user experience by allowing easy access to supplementary materials, fostering a more interactive and informative environment.
Creating the documents
Create a folder ‘slides’ in the root folder of our Google Drive, and create our page in this folder.
As a subject, I will create slides about York, the English city where I live. I will create five pages with images and information. The code will not be restricted to five pages; use as many as you need.
My pages will be simple to show the context of creating an SPA, and the layout will be
Title, Image, Descriptive text, Metadata
Similar to this, each page is different, and it will expand on the text.
Accessing the pages
Query-index
All pages created? Add a query-index spreadsheet in the folder; we covered this in part three when we created a query-index in the root folder. As a reminder, we want a blank like this.
Now preview and publish the pages.
Edge Delivery Services populates the query-index
We can look at the json
We should create the landing page.
“Five things to do in York, England”
In this page we added a single block ‘slide builder’; which will contain the JavaScript and styling for our SPA.
Remember that Edge Delivery Services replace non-printing, and strange characters with hyphens; we need to create our files in
/blocks/slide-builder/slide-builder.css
/blocks/slide-builder/slide-builder.js
The JS is the first thing I will create. We use ‘fetch’ to obtain the json from our query-index in the slides folder of the Google Drive, iterate over every entry and make the initial page markup.
We will develop the code step by step.
As usual, we start with our export statement; it is good practice to do this
We have started with a query to check if WebP, high-speed images, is supported.
We will layer this up as we go through the tutorial.
Fetch the slides
There are two functions here; the first fetch retrieves the query-index inside the /slides/ folder, which lists the published slide we saw in the json above.
However, each slide page has information we want for the SPA, a hero-type image with variations for mobile etc, the intro para and detailed paragraphs; we need to pick those up too. We bypass this in a mobile view (viewport <800). In the mobile view, the html is replaced by a null. The fetchSlideHtml function appends ‘.plain.html’ to the path; this signals to Edge Delivery Services to treat the page as a fragment and only return plain html without a header footer or any javascript - just plain html.
If returned, it is stored in the json for later use.
Next step, add the slides.
We Iterate over the json and call functions to build our app; we use an intersection observer feature to lazy load our images. That bit that says rootMargin: 100px is the wiggle room for our image coming into view.
Create each slide
The createSlideItem function builds all of the html necessary to display an individual slide, adding a click handler, which creates a panel; if we are running on a desktop, it adds additional supporting text (the first paragraph from the HTML) to the slide.
This technique speeds up mobile whilst keeping the desktop view enriched. The design is mobile-first, desktop-enriched.
The CreatePanel Function
In the createPanel we check to see if the HTML is present to display; if not we fetch it. Remember it is not present on the mobile view; keeping this responsive and fast. We add the controls to dismiss the panel.
FetchSupportingText Function
The FetchSupportingText function reads the HTML, if present, from the html node of the Json, parses it with the Dom Parser and extracts the first paragraph after the first h2 element. This is an essential technique in Edge Delivery Services; the web uses modern javascript, and the browsers fully support parsing DOM structures. Edge Delivery services treat the DOM as a first-class citizen, tying this with ‘plain.html’, and developers have a rich resource set.
Setting the background image
Two things are happening here: the url is constructed from the original image url, which was present in the metadata, and therefore, the image node of the json. We use the supportsWebP variable to adjust the image for WebP serving from Edge Delivery, set width and optimise level through a query string. We go for the original image if the browser does not support WebP.
Notice that we have img.onload and image.onerror functions to support lazy loading.
That was a lot to cover
Here is the complete listing
Completing the ask, the CSS
Phew that is complicated; by breaking it into smaller pieces, I hope you see that the design fits together and you will be able to build SPA Applications with query-index.json and .plain.html
We managed to keep great lighthouse scores despite using lots of fetch and stitching together. Edge Delivery Services is a wonderful tool.
The finished Spa App is here Five things to do in York, England (allabout.network)
In contrast, we can convert this into a ReactJS application and serve it directly from Edge Delivery Services, which will be the next part of this series.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 5
Building a ReactJS app
This is part 5 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. This time, we will create a React App that uses Edge Delivery Services as the data source.
Previously
We created a SPA app using Documents as the data source and a document with a block to serve the content.
Part 5 - Building a React app with documents as the source
As a developer, you may be more familiar with ReactJs and want to use those skills in Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. You may also have an existing ReactJs app that you want to bring into the Edge Delivery Services Infrastructure. Whatever your reason, this tutorial will help you use ReactJs with Edge Delivery.
I walk you through converting the slide builder block we built in part 4 into a modular React app. We'll cover the key steps and considerations to ensure a smooth transition.
1. Understanding the Original Structure
The original approach was a block consisting of a single JavaScript file (slide-builder.js) and a corresponding CSS file (slide-builder.css). This monolithic approach worked well within the Edge Delivery Services ecosystem, it needs modularity to work well with React.
2. Breaking Down the Components
The first step in our conversion is to identify the main components of our application:
- SlideBuilder: The main container for all slides
- SlideItem: Individual slide components
- SlidePanel: The panel that opens when a slide is clicked
3. Setting Up the React Project
Start by creating a new React project. You can use Create React App or your preferred React boilerplate.
After creating a new React project with the Create React App, you can streamline your project by removing several files that aren't necessary for our conversion. Here's a list of files you can safely delete:
1. In the `src` folder:
- `App.test.js` (We are a tutorial, no tests. Do this later)
- `logo.svg` (the React logo, which we won't be using)
- `reportWebVitals.js` (we will not need web vitals reporting)
- `setupTests.js` (no tests, see above)
2. In the `public` folder:
- `logo192.png` and `logo512.png` (React logos)
- `manifest.json` (We are not building a Progressive Web App)
- we can delete favicon.ico
- `robots.txt`
Rename index.html to slides.html
After cleaning up, your project structure might look like this:
This cleaned-up structure provides a good starting point for implementing your converted React application. You can now add your new components and styles to the `src` folder. The final project structure will end up like this.
The index.html<!DOCTYPE html>
Now app.js
Instead of directly fetching data in the decorate function, I used React's useEffect hook in the App component to fetch slide data when the component mounts.
app.css
We employ hooks such as React, useState, and useEffect in React. Additionally, we integrate the SlideBuilder component and the App.css file. The App function component serves as the foundation of our application. With the assistance of the useState hook, we effectively manage the "slides" state. To retrieve slide data upon component mounting, we utilize the useEffect hook. The fetchSlides function, an asynchronous operation, acquires slide data from the "/slides/query-index.json" endpoint. The component structure encompasses a header and a primary section. Within the main section, the SlideBuilder component is rendered, passing slide data as a property.
index.js, remove core web vitals
Change README.md
4. Creating React Components
Now, let's create our React components:
- src/components/SlideBuilder.js
- src/components/SlideItem.js
- src/components/SlidePanel.js
Don’t worry about dangerouslySetInnerHTML. I only obtained a text node in the first place.
Each component encapsulates its logic and render method.
The core logic from the original `decorate` function was distributed among these components:
- Moved slide fetching logic to the main App component
- Implemented background image loading in SlideItem
- Handled panel opening/closing in SlideItem and SlidePanel
5. Styling
Create separate CSS files for each component:
- src/styles/SlideBuilder.css
- src/styles/SlideItem.css
- src/styles/SlidePanel.css
Build the output
To distribute your React application, you must create a production build and then deploy it. Here's a step-by-step guide on what you need to do:
Create a Production Build:
In your project directory, run the following:
npm run build
This command creates a build directory with a production build of your app.
The build directory will contain:
To distribute your app, you need to serve the contents of the build directory.
Returning to our Edge Delivery Services repository, it looks similar to the archetypal boilerplate.
Copy the internal part of the build folder, the static folder and the index.html to the root of the Edge Delivery Repo
Rename index.html to slides.html
Now, the Repo is integrated, as seen below.
We have added slides.html and the static directory.
Now commit and push your Repo.
Conclusion
Converting an Edge Delivery Services block to a React application involves breaking down the monolithic structure into reusable components, adapting the logic to work with React's lifecycle and hooks, and ensuring that all functionality is preserved. While it requires some effort, the result is an extensible codebase that leverages the power of React's component-based architecture. I prefer the block format; this tutorial is to help give you options.
Remember, this conversion is just the beginning. Once in React, you can further enhance your application with additional features, optimize performance, and integrate with other React libraries and tools. If your customer already has a ReactJS application, a calculator, or something more sophisticated, you can easily integrate this into your Edge Delivery Services site collection.
The final ReactJS application, served directly from GitHub, cannot be previewed using the sidekick and thus cannot be published through it. Despite this, it is live. You can view it here https://allabout.network/slides.html

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 6
Json and GitHub
A bit more info on Json, using GitHub as a fallback for sheets
This is part 6 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services; this time, we will investigate Json and The GitHub connection.
Previously
We created a SPA app using Documents as the data source and a document with ReactJS to serve the content.
Part 6 - Json and Github
Edge Delivery Services can create an index of published material; one uses a Google sheet/ Microsoft Excel sheet to do this work. Full details here Indexing (www.aem.live)
If we provide the blank query index in the notes folder, they are entered into the sheet as shown when Edge Delivery Servies creates published pages.
Then the json is produced by the url main--allaboutv2--ddttom.hlx.live/notes/query-index.json
We discussed all of this in an earlier article, in part 3.
The critical thing to note is the structure of the json returned from the sheet; we can create json from a sheet by creating titles and cell entries like this.
This, in turn, will provide simple json
In edge delivery services, any json that is provided in the root folder with the path name of header.json is applied to the website. Edge Delivery Services will use these headers for the paths mentioned in the url element. Note the wildcard. Custom HTTP Response Headers (www.aem.live)
You may not want to give content authors complete control over the headers; it is a complex subject with wildcarding and key/value entries. I suggest making this a developer's responsibility.
If you create a matching headers.json in your code editor and add it to the GitHub root folder, then GitHub will be used if the sheet has yet to be created. The beauty of Edge Delivery services is that if the user is technical and aware of the technique to create their sheet, they can do so, and their version of the json will override the developer-provided one. I use this technique in my development of Edge Delivery Services Projects.
I have configuration information in a file named /config/defaults.json in my GitHub.
I have kept the generated JSON original layout as if I had created it on a sheet. However, I have changed the type to ‘fallback’ so that I can debug it later.
If we need to change things on production without releasing new code, we just have to create a new sheet named defaults with all the information, including the changes and then publish it.
Other sheets used in Edge Delivery Services are
Metadata (Bulk Metadata (www.aem.live))
Redirects (Redirects (www.aem.live))
Config (Project Configuration (www.aem.live)) is a particular item in a special folder. It cannot be served on the web and cannot be previewed.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 7
Useful Components
Blocks I use in my guides.
Index
Returntotop
Bloglist
I explain the additional blocks I use in my guides.
Previously
We discussed Google Sheets/ Excel spreadsheets, Edge Delivery Services automatic conversion to Json, and the ability to create fallbacks in Github.
Part 7 - Useful Components
In building this series, I have created three blocks (or components, in old CMS speak) that help provide navigation widgets.
Index - provides an expanding index of the topics in the article.
Returntotop - provides a back-to-top button when the reader scrolls away from the opening viewport.
Bloglist - provides a list of related articles.
Each block is designed to be intuitive for the user and easy for the content author, automating the work. The content author just has to place the item in the correct place in the document, as a block fragment, queued in by a table. The code achieves this functionality using vanilla JavaScript, CSS 3 and DOM manipulation; no frameworks or libraries are involved - this is the perfect way to create Edge Delivery Services blocks (components).
returntotop
I will begin with the simplest one, returntotop
The function makes the "Back to Top" button visible when the user scrolls down over 100 pixels. The page smoothly scrolls back to the top when the button is clicked.
This block has two cells: the first one is the block name, and the second is the content. The content is the wording the author wants to use when it is displayed; one may wish to use different phrasing or say it in French; it is up to the content author.
As always, create the folder returntotop under the blocks folder, then make two files returntotop.css and returntotop.js
returntotop.css contains the styling.
.
The returntotop.js contains the code.
It adds an event listener to the window object that listens for the scroll event. The button is displayed when the user scrolls down more than 100 pixels (display: 'block'). Otherwise, the button is hidden (display: 'none').
index
Once again, create a folder inside blocks called index and two files, index.css and index.js, in this folder.
Index.css should contain
And index.js
This code creates an interactive webpage index by selecting all header elements (h1 to h6) and the index block. It creates an index header with a clickable arrow and an index content container. The index is built lazily - only when the user first clicks on the index header. Clicking the index header toggles the visibility of the index content and rotates the arrow.
The buildIndex function creates a list of links to all headers on the page, indenting them based on their header level (h1, h2, etc.). Each header is given a unique ID, and the index links are created to point to these IDs.
Finally
bloglist
Create a folder inside blocks called bloglist and then add the two files bloglist.css and bloglist.js.
Bloglist.css
This CSS creates a responsive blog list layout, using CSS Grid for the blog list, with auto-fitting columns. Each blog item is a flex container with a border. Blog images are set to a fixed height with full width. The last modified date is pushed to the bottom with a separator line. On mobile (< 600px), it switches to a single-column layout.
The Javascript file
The Javascript fetches blog data from "/query-index.json", filtering blog items to include only those with "developer-guide" in the path, sorts the filtered items alphabetically by title, generates HTML content for the blog list and inserts the generated content into the DOM.

# Guide to Creating Blocks in Edge Delivery Services (EDS) or Franklin, Helix

Blocks are modular components used in development to create reusable and customizable sections of a webpage.

## Block Structure
- Each block typically consists of two main files, and an optional third:
  1. A CSS file (e.g., `blockname.css`) for styling
  2. A JavaScript file (e.g., `blockname.js`) for functionality
  3. a README.md for documentation


If asked to create a block, one should always create a README.md alongside it

## Key Components of a Block

### CSS File
- Contains styles specific to the block
- Often includes responsive design for different screen sizes
- May use CSS variables for theming

### JavaScript File
- Exports a `decorate` function as the default
- The `decorate` function typically:
  - Manipulates the DOM to create the block's structure
  - Adds event listeners for interactivity
  - Fetches data if needed (e.g., from JSON files)
  - Applies dynamic styling
  
### Markdown File
- Contains documentation of use to the developer, maintainer or content author

### Common Patterns
- Use of `document.createElement` to create elements
- Applying classes for styling
- Creating nested structures (e.g., for carousels or grids)
- Fetching and processing data (often using `fetch` API)
- Implementing responsive behavior

## Best Practices
1. Keep blocks modular and reusable
2. Use semantic HTML where possible
3. Implement accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
4. Optimize for performance (lazy loading, efficient DOM manipulation)
5. Follow a consistent naming convention for classes and IDs

## Advanced Features
- Some blocks may use external libraries or APIs
- Complex blocks may implement lazy loading or infinite scrolling
- Interactive blocks often use event delegation for efficiency

## Integration
- Blocks are typically integrated into a larger project structure
- They may interact with a content management system or data layer
- Often used in conjunction with a main JavaScript file that handles overall page behavior

This guide provides a high-level overview of creating blocks in web development. Each block type has its own specific implementation details and requirements.

What follows is sample blocks from my GitHub repository

        // Check if the <img> element has a non-empty alt attribute
        if (imgElement && imgElement.getAttribute('alt')) {
            author = imgElement.getAttribute('alt');
        }

        // If the alt attribute is empty or not present, fall back to the <meta> tag's author content
        if (!author) {
            const metaAuthor = document.querySelector('meta[name="author"]');
            if (metaAuthor) {
                author = metaAuthor.getAttribute('content');

        }

        // Create a new <strong> element to hold the author name
        const authorElement = document.createElement('strong');
        authorElement.textContent = author;

        // Find the .bio.block element
        const bioBlock = document.querySelector('.bio.block');

# return to top block

This code adds a "return to top" button feature to the webpage. Here's how it works:

1. **Button Selection:** It first identifies the button element on the webpage that is intended to return the user to the top of the page. This button is marked with a specific class.

2. **Scroll Event Handling:** The code listens for when the user scrolls up or down on the page. If the user scrolls down more than 100 pixels, the button is made visible. If the user scrolls back up so that they are within 100 pixels from the top, the button is hidden.

3. **Button Click Behavior:** When the visible button is clicked, the page smoothly scrolls back to the top. This gives users a quick and easy way to return to the top of the page without having to manually scroll back up.

##### This is the end of the examples

When asked to create anything, if the result is a block, remember to create a README.md

All js, cs and md files should obey the air-bnb linting style guide

use await rather than .then() for asynch code

always list every line and function in code

lib-franklin.js has been renamed aem.js; remember to check this in the generated code and replace it if necessary

Introduction
I am a developer; arrays start at element 0, or I began writing with part 1 and now need an introduction. You choose.
This series of articles discusses developing with Adobe’s Edge Delivery Services in the Context of Document Authoring.
What is Document Authoring?
Creating and publishing content in the digital landscape involves multiple steps and stakeholders. Subject Matter Experts generate original content, which goes through an approval process. The approved content is then passed to Content Authors, who copy and paste sub-edited content into the Content Management System (CMS) for publishing. This process can be time-consuming, especially in regulated industries, where the approval process can take a long time.
Content Authors dislike CMS systems. They are forced to use “components” and “templates” created by technicians, using “page properties” and “dialog boxes” to pull the whole piece together; they have to sub-edit the copy because it often won’t fit in the constraints of the CMS. They usually have to backport the content to the original document format as a system of record. Returning the document to the SME with a link to the final web-page page.
Product Owners dislike CMS systems, especially in regulated industries. They must get approval for every line of text they place on the web. Regulated industries, like pharmaceuticals, automobile makers, insurers, etc., are legally bound by the content they publish and the corporation's stringent requirements. One product owner I know of asked that pre-approved Excel spreadsheets drive the entire CMS; however, the technicians have built the components and templates around dialogue boxes. He, too, had to use the copy-paste methodology.
Enter Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services from Adobe, sometimes called EDS. This system stands out for its innovative approach to web publishing and promises to redefine efficiency and simplicity in the industry.
It is a cutting-edge document-based CMS, named in tribute to Rosalind Franklin, whose work was crucial in deciphering DNA's structure. It has transformed from the "Helix" concept to the current "Edge Delivery Services," signifying its growth from a rudimentary tool to a comprehensive digital content management solution. It has shared all three names in its lifetime: Franklin, Helix and now Edge Delivery Services.
Why Document Authoring with Adobe Edge Delivery Services Matters

Conclusion:Edge Delivery Services is a powerful tool for businesses looking to enhance their online presence. Its focus on speed, scalability and ease of use can help companies to create engaging and compelling digital experiences.
Weighing the Benefits and Limitations
Edge Delivery Services is designed to deliver content with unparalleled efficiency, addressing the challenges of handling extensive information without compromising performance. It opens the content management field to a broader audience, enabling more professionals to contribute effectively. However, it's essential to acknowledge that Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services may not be the one-size-fits-all solution for every scenario, mainly where intricate customization and deep content modelling and structuring are paramount. Edge Delivery Services offers deeper integration with traditional AEM for requests that require content modelling and deeper integration with the back-end. Adobe has you covered. Think of Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services as the rapid delivery of traditional documents - ‘a Content Marketing System’. When customers require more sophisticated back-ends, AEM Authoring with Edge Delivery Services is ready to take up the workload and continue to integrate with the document authoring solutions in place.
Is it Edge Delivery Service or Edge Delivery Services?
Good question. It is Edge Delivery Services, as many different services are involved in delivery at the Edge (close to the customer). There are asset services, authentication services, JSON services, content services, and CDN (Content Delivery Network) services. The Adobe-provided services run on ADOBE IO, a serverless environment.
Edge Delivery Services is the final publishing point; many projects provide content for this platform.
At the time of writing, there are three providers (in order of appearance):
gdocs2md (Google)
word2md (Microsoft)
html2md (Bring your own markup)
The last one supports:
Crosswalk, Commerce, and Dark Alley. Universal Editor is something that is sitting on top of Crosswalk (from the perspective of Edge Delivery Services)
Project Helix (which was later extended into Franklin) covers delivery, authoring (through Sidekick), and integration (through the Admin API). To refer to the Word and Google integration only as Helix isn't how the Adobe team has been looking at it - and still isn't, as they use Helix now to refer to the same core architecture.
Edge Delivery Services (for AEM Sites) includes only the delivery part, as far as the product is packaged. There is no official name for the whole stack.
This is a complex relationship, making discussion challenging. I will focus on Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.
Each provider creates digital entities that are stored in a content bus. This includes content from cloud-based sources, including code, assets, text, HTML, JSON and configuration data. The platform serves the content bus.
It is essential to keep these two entities separate in your mind. There are providers, and Edge Delivery Services is the platform.
Why invest in this technology?
Performance. Edge Delivery Services is faster, which increases customer engagement. There are lots of studies showing that speed counts. Adobe wants to create the world's fastest websites, so it experimented to see what would happen if all our customers had the world's fastest sites! So Adobe did this.
Surely a CDN does this for AEM?
It helps, but there is more than just CDN delivery. CDNs are great for global audiences, but users usually have multiple CDNs, dispatcher caches, Akamai, etc. Edge Delivery Services is not a CDN. It sits side by side, feeding one CDN! It runs next to your CDN, not in parallel.
What speed do we expect?
Lighthouse has its challenges. Edge Delivery Services sends pages optimally, not including any JS cumulative layout shift. If you get 100 on Lighthouse, you will be among the fastest in the world. Adobe aimed for 80-100 for Edge Delivery Services, and they achieved it.
Is this just for static content?
Great question. The magic is caused by rethinking resources, with a server component that organises the resources and a client part that personalises. Working together, these two parts allow super-fast dynamic page content. Adobe first focused on what was visible to the user, improving static and dynamic pages. There is no such thing as a static page in Edge Delivery Services.
Did Adobe create a new JS framework to do this?
Current front-end frameworks are designed around limitations in the stack, but browsers have improved, protocols have changed, HTTP/3 is available, and limitations are gone. So Adobe does not call what they are doing a “framework”; it is the web platform. Adobe uses the best bits from the new world. In the old world, software used a bundler to consume assets and placed it on a server for a client to consume. Edge Delivery Services is a no-bundler; source code coordination is used instead. The goal was to make Edge Delivery Services easy to use and make the time to rebuild a site super fast. Instead of incrementally adapting a site to a new design, authors use the tools they have learnt: Excel, Word, Google Drive, etc.
What does the platform bring?
Performance optimisation: Edge Delivery Services focuses heavily on web performance. It helps serve websites at lightning-fast speeds from edge locations (geographically closer to users) for lower loading times. Unmatched speed – get a Lighthouse reading of 100s.
Content at scale: It can handle thousands of pages. Adobe has 300,000+ pages on its website, as Edge Delivery Services pages.
Content first: Whether structured or unstructured, AEM prioritises your content, delivers it optimally, and provides your developers with everything they need to make it shine.
Enhanced developer experience: Edge Delivery Services empowers developers using modern front-end technologies and frameworks..
Real user monitoring (RUM) provides real-time performance metrics, so any dips or issues can be addressed quickly, maintaining a great user experience.
Flexibility: Edge Delivery Services is composable, meaning you can use only the specific services you need for your project. No matter where your data is, you can bring it into Edge Delivery Services.
Why Edge Delivery Services Matters
Website speed and user experience are crucial. Edge Delivery Services helps businesses achieve:
Faster time to market: Get content updates live much quicker. With its serverless, lightweight approach to web development, Edge Delivery Services allows you to go live in weeks, onboard new developers in days and iterate on changes in minutes. Unlimited preview sites give you confidence that changes will be what you need.
Improved SEO: Faster websites get a boost in search rankings.
Increased customer engagement: A smooth, fast website keeps users engaged, leading to potentially higher conversion rates.
Zero backend development: No building via Maven, Grunt, etc. Edge Delivery Services uses everything modern web developers love: GitHub, local development with auto-reload, performance, and simplicity. And none of the complications: no transpilation, no bundlers, no configurations, no overhead, no pipelines.
Low-code productivity: No frameworks, plain HTML, modern CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Simple to onboard devs: no backend (needs repeating!).
One less thing to be on call for. Incredible availability due to fully redundant architecture, endless scalability as a full software-as-a-service, and easy integrations with your existing CDN make go-live anxiety a thing of the past.
From Cedric Heusler: The short version is that we are building the “bottomless CMS” - a set of CMS services independent of the content. The content is either already in the cloud (SharePoint, etc.) or managed with a domain-specific workflow AND in a CMS. All this content comes together in the brand/enterprise experience.
How does Edge Delivery Services differ from AEM?
Unlike traditional content management systems (CMSs), this solution does not require a dedicated authoring or publishing environment. Instead, it leverages platforms like Google Drive or SharePoint to create and manage content published directly to Edge Delivery Services for fast and reliable delivery to end-users. This serverless approach eliminates the need for complex infrastructure and maintenance, making it a cost-effective and scalable option for content delivery.
Components can be used immediately as the pages have been built beforehand, eliminating the need to wait for a CDN call to the dispatcher or for the components to run on a publisher.
No bundling of JS/CSS (Clientlibs).
The code relies solely on modern JavaScript and CSS without needing external JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.
Pages are controlled through spreadsheets, redirects, indexes, and metadata, all converted into JSON by Edge Delivery Services.
Paths in Google Drive/SharePoint control the tree structure of pages.
Plug-in tools like Asset Picker from Adobe and Translate from Google can be used.
Developers store code in GitHub: no build to deploy.
Each branch in GitHub has a separate live preview.
Zero pipelines, no delay in publishing. Fast.
Did I say fast and easy using tools you already know?
To end this introduction, I must create a ‘hello world’ for Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.
Code is coordinated by scripts.js in the scripts folder.
You can see the code in scripts that control loading:
This pattern is known as E-L-D, Eager, Lazy, Delayed, which optimizes the page loading sequence to help us get to the 100/100/100/100 model.
Earlier in the sequence, scripts.js inspects the page held in the content bus and modified to be the intermediate state; the code scans for ‘blocks’ and when finding one, it injects the cs and javascript, executing the JS if any is placed in line.
Creating HelloWorld
I will assume that you have cloned the https://github.com/adobe/aem-boilerplate repo and setup your Edge Delivery Services folder following Getting Started – Developer Tutorial (www.aem.live)
To create a simple "Hello World" block in Edge Delivery Services, you'll need to create a CSS file for styling and a JavaScript file for functionality. Here's how you can do it:
Create a new folder named "helloworld" in your blocks directory in the GitHub repository
Create two files inside the "helloworld" folder: helloworld.css and helloworld.js.
In helloworld.css, add the following content:
In helloworld.js, add the following content:
In your Google document, insert a table, one cell wide and one cell deep.
In this cell, add the text ‘helloworld’
The existence of the table with the first cell name is the link to the code; Edge Delivery Services looks in the blocks folder and cell-name folder for similarly named js and css, applying the js and the css to the DOM. Magic completed, and the results look like this.

Introduction
This is a developer's guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. It assumes you have access to a content team to create the content.
I was only joking. Developers can type content.
This tutorial will guide you through creating your blocks and amending the HTML provided by Edge Delivery Services to ensure that the page has the look and feel you need, with coding examples.
Document-based authoring: Edge Delivery Services allows content creators to use familiar tools like Microsoft Word, Google Docs and spreadsheets to author and structure website content, greatly simplifying the process.
All work on a modern website starts with a product owner, a creative person who wants to describe a product or a service. A marketing lead often briefs the product owner. The initial stages usually start with a document, such as Word or Google Docs. The idea is fleshed out and spread around the various teams until everybody is happy with the outcome, messaging and possibly pricing. Sample images and other content are often embedded in the document.
This is then sent to the web content team, which will design a new web page in the site hierarchy or a landing page distinct from the rest of the website. Based on the document's contents, the team may have a design ready or commission one.
The team then copies and pastes the images and text from the document into ‘components’ placed on a ‘template’ within the CMS. Sometimes, they must adjust the copy to fit the page template or component. When changes have been made, the copied and pasted text is placed back into the document as a system of record, and when the web page has been published, the amended document is sent back to the product owner.
This can be a long process. Templates and components need building from a busy dev team; the content team is busy creating the next season's campaigns; the author server is down for routine maintenance. The page may not need much design; it may be design-ready with known components, and you might have Edge Delivery Services (Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services). Good. We will publish the page and step through the processes, adjusting code and styling.
If you do not have Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services installed, the tutorial at https://aem.live is easy to follow.
Beginning with a simple page,
We begin with a simple page, one with a simple title and simple text in Google Docs:
The document above is named Hello World, and the text states, “Hello World From Edge Delivery Services.” Pressing the Preview button transfers the document as HTML to Edge Delivery Services’ content bus, which stores all the content for the eventual web pages. We also have a code bus and an asset bus.
The system then creates a web page.
Not very complicated. Look at the ‘view page source’ code:
What happened?
The title, og:title and twitter:title were created from the first and only line in the text, and the canonical meta tag and the og:url were created from the page's location, formed by domain name/Google Drive location.
Also note that the domain name, in this case, main--allaboutv2--ddttom, was taken from my GitHub branch, as well as the repo name and username. If I created a new branch, say testing, then the domain name would change to testing--allaboutv2--ddttom. The double hyphens -- separate each element. This allows for the testing of new code without breaking the site.
A default image tag for og: image :secure_url, og:image, and Twitter:image has been provided. I must include this default image in my codebase.
The viewport tag has been provided.
Finally, the scripts aem.js and scripts.js are loaded
I have an empty header and footer in my Edge Delivery Services implementations. If one wants these to be present, one can create them in Google Drive, following similar rules to page creation.
The central part of the HTML is a div, followed by a paragraph and text. This is a very simple web page.
But what happens inside the browser?
You will see that the DOM has been adjusted or decorated. This is by design. Edge Delivery Services provides the document in a raw HTML format with known patterns. It is up to the developers to shape the HTML to the end requirements.
Edge Delivery Services has added the HTML to load our CSS through style sheets. Two different patterns are used: styles.css and lazy-style.css. As the document is processed, there are three phases: load-eager, load-page, and load-lazy. Load-eager gets the important “before the fold” stuff and everything needed to get the page set up as quickly as possible; load-page is our standard run-of-the-mill stuff, and load-lazy is for actions that don’t matter, such as animations. Further details will be provided later.
Edge Delivery Services has injected extra scripts into the header, inspecting the raw HTML and deciding which components are used. In our case, we have a header and a footer (though both are blank). Edge Delivery Services has decided that we are using the header and footer components. Edge Delivery Services calls the components ‘blocks,’ adding the CSS to the DOM and running the JS from the same folder.
We are using modern JavaScript techniques in Edge Delivery Services, so the JavaScript is dynamically imported, similar to:
Although it uses a more elegant method.
The JavaScript that comes with the blocks can modify and shape the DOM to match the styling requirements. This is a more advanced technique that will be explained later.
The standard “out of the box” causes the body element to be non-displayed.
You should also note that we are using CSS3 variables in our CSS.
When the page is finally ready to be seen, the class “appear” is applied to the body, and the page becomes visible, thus stopping any flashes of unstyled content.
Semantic header and footer elements are added to the DOM, and wrappers are added as a class to each part. The document is split into sections, only one in this raw case. As the JS runs for each ‘block’ or ‘section’, a data-block-status or a section-block-status class with a value of “loaded” is added; this will help prevent this fraction of the DOM from being handled more than once. It's also a signal to the CSS to action new styles.
The raw line of text is given a <div class=”default-content-wrapper”>
In summary, Edge Delivery Services applies clever conventions on top of the Google/Word Doc, sending minimal HTML to the browser with minimal JavaScript, preferably over an HTTP/3 channel. The JavaScript inspects the HTML and then decorates it by following rules.
We have yet to discover the rules in this document. As there is no configuration in the document, Edge Delivery Services uses a technique known as auto-blocking, which uses ‘smart algorithms’ to understand the author's intent.
What’s this about rules?
Documents need descriptions, titles, etc. Edge Delivery Services tries to provide them, but it would be better if the author had control. In document authoring, we use tables to give rules.
The image above shows our document with a table with two columns. The first row is merged and given the name ‘metadata’. This is the clue to Edge Delivery Services to use this information to adjust the metadata in the HTML.
The left column contains the key phrase, and the right column contains the content. It is traditional to place this table at the foot of the document.
What this metadata does to our HTML
In this HTML, you can see that the title matches our title and that the description is mapped to the description fields in the og:description and twitter:description fields.
A new meta field has been added:
<meta name="keywords" content="Explanatory, web, page, hello, world">
This ability to add rules to the document is critical to creating interesting web pages.
We can add one of the built-in rules. If they contain code and styling, they are called blocks.
Add a block called columns:
Now inspect the view page source. We will look at <main> as we have not changed the metadata.
The block name (columns) is now held within a div element with a class of “columns.” This signals Edge Delivery Services to adjust the DOM, as we will see later.
Although we used a table to define our block, Edge Delivery Services used div elements to separate each cell. We have not gone back in time and are about to style tables. Edge Delivery Services is much more intelligent than that.
Inspecting the rendered DOM, where .…. represents unchanged parts
The image in og:image and og: imagesecure_url has been replaced by the URL for the image in the metadata table, which was the default.
This is our first time using an image in our sample document. You will notice that the doc format has embedded the image into the document, and its original name is lost. Edge Delivery Services creates a unique ID. If the same image is used in multiple places, the ID is the same; it is a hash of the image. You will notice in the HTML a query string: ?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium"
The &#x26; is an HTML entity representing the ampersand character (&). It is inserted in the string to disambiguate the parameters. So, it states that the image should be resized to 1200 pixels in width and served as a progressive jpeg with medium optimisation. Noting this, it is best to provide an image 1200 pixels wide in the image metadata portion of the page. Edge Delivery Services will stretch or shrink your image to fit if you do not.
We will add images to our website and see what Edge Delivery Services offers later.
The CSS for columns has been added to the DOM:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/blocks/columns/columns.css">
At the same time as this decoration, the js in /blocks/columns/columns.js has been imported and executed.
A div with class=”columns-wrapper” has been added to the DOM just before the text.
The original div class = ”columns” has been extended, and new classes have been added: block to inform Edge Delivery Services that this is a block and columns-2-cols to ensure that the correct styling for a two-column div is applied.
The code in column.js does this decoration to transform the raw HTML into a structure that can be styled.
The code above reads the number of divs in the first child and gets the count; it then adds the class with a count derived from the number of children.
The last part of the js looks for picture elements - added at the document level - and decorates the cell with columns-img-col if found.
We are adjusting our document and placing the same image with author details at the top of the page.
I have opened the image options panel in Google Drive to show the placement of alt text and title of this image. I am using the same image as I used in the metadata; we will be able to see the different treatments given to the image by Edge Delivery Services.
Preview the page in the browser.
Inspecting the view page source, from main onwards:
Keep in mind the original og:image metadata:
The HTML provided shows that the picture element was used. The HTML picture element is a powerful tool for creating websites. It allows web developers to specify multiple image sources, ensuring the browser displays the most appropriate image for the user's device and network conditions. Additionally, the picture element provides a fallback mechanism for browsers that do not support it, ensuring users always see some form of the image.
The picture element constructed has the following pattern. I have abstracted the name and shortened the optimisation part to show the layout.
This element has media query conditions that choose the correct width for a mobile device (min-width:600). There are format options to choose WebP (format=webply) or JPEG (format=jpeg). The browser will use this mix to select the correct image for the viewport size and browser capabilities. Finally, there is a fallback - for browsers or tools that need help understanding the picture element (few these days).
Inspecting the HTML code reveals that the same image is used everywhere as the source. The query-string modifier changes what is served to the browser. In our case:./media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpeg
Creating a bio block
We will improve the content team's experience by creating a bio block and writing some JavaScript and CSS to add the image title as a byline for the bio. Search for the meta author if the image does not contain a title.
The first step is to extend the page metadata table to add a new entry: author. Remember, the first column is case-insensitive, but the second is not.
The next step is encapsulating the content in a new bio block and adding the text underneath.
Now, we must style the block and write the JavaScript to decorate it however we want.
Inspect the new block “bio” when looking at the view source page for the raw HTML:
We know that Edge Delivery Services decorates our block when it downloads; looking at the rendered DOM, just the bio block:
We see that the <div class=”bio”> has been replaced with
This allows us to target CSS onto the block.
We will put the bio picture into a circle.
The CSS styling is stored in /blocks/bio/bio.css
Developer Guide to document authoring with Edge Delivery Services
We now want to add some JavaScript to retrieve the alt text or, if not present, read the meta name=author content into a Javascript variable named author, using the variable to enhance the bio element display. The content team no longer need to write the author's name if the metadata is correct, either on the alt or the meta author tag.
Create the new \blocks\bio\bio.js
Previewing the page:
By adding classes, we can create variations of our block. We add extra names in brackets after the block's name. We now make a highlighted variation of the bio block.
We adjust our styling in \blocks\bio\bio.css
As we have the circle (border-radius….), the browser version shows the image with a 2px blue border.
The ability to create many block variations is a powerful feature that can add visual interest and interactivity to a web page. Using styling and JavaScript introspection, unique and engaging blocks can be created.
Here are some examples of how styling and JavaScript introspection can be used to create block variations:
Styling:
Use different colours, fonts and sizes to create various visual styles.
Add borders, shadows and other effects to create depth and dimension.
Use CSS animations and transitions to create dynamic effects.

By combining styling and JavaScript introspection, blocks can be created that are visually appealing and interactive, creating a more engaging and enjoyable user experience.
Creating a hero block
A hero block, frequently called the hero image or hero banner, is crucial at the start of many web pages. This large, page-wide image is strategically positioned to capture the visitor's attention upon landing immediately.
We begin by inserting a table in the document. The first cell is named Hero, and the image is in the second cell.
When we preview this, the hero takes up the entire screen width.
Even when viewed on a mobile device, it looks good.
You may remember that Edge Delivery Services makes a fresh version at different resolutions (picture element, media-query), transforming JPEG into WebP format. This may distort the mobile view by crushing the pixels, giving you a fuzzy appearance.
You may want a different hero on a mobile, which is an editorial decision. The auto-scaled version of the desktop hero sometimes needs to be fixed for a mobile hero.
How do we do this? With a slight modification of the hero table and a bit of JavaScript.
Add a suitable mobile image in a two-cell wide table.
When this is previewed, we are shocked. It is not what we wanted. We ended up with the second image as the hero; the desktop image got lost.
Looking at the rendered HTML:
Add code to the hero block.
As expected, we see two picture elements. We need to decorate this part of the site to combine them. By convention, the first row is the desktop image, and the second is the mobile image.
We add code to the empty \blocks\hero\hero.js
The code performs manipulations on the picture elements. It starts by selecting two <picture> elements: the first one is located inside the first <div> element within an element with the class name hero, and the second one is located inside the second <div> element within the first <div> element of the hero class.
If both these <picture> elements exist, the code proceeds to do the following:
1. It selects the second <source> element from the second <picture> element.
2. If the second <source> element exists, it creates a copy of it.
3. It then checks if the first <picture> element has a second <source> element.
If it does, the code replaces the existing second <source> element in the first <picture> element with the copied <source> element from the second <picture> element.
If it doesn't, the code adds the copied <source> element as a new child of the first <picture> element.
4. Finally, the code removes the document's second <picture> element.
If only one picture element exists, the code does nothing, and the hero still works.
Just a little touch of magic.
See the screenshots below:
Desktop image
Mobile image
Finally, the rendered picture elements - following the adjustments:<div class="hero-wrapper">
The two picture elements have been merged into one.
All this work has been done without affecting the Lighthouse page speed.
If you follow along, you will have a very similar page. See here An explanatory web page

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 2
Creating variations of our block
Automating Author Name from Alt Text
Place text to the right of BIO
Use of fragments
Theming
This post continues my Developer’s guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.
Previously
We created a Google Doc called ‘Hello World’. It has a hero and a bio block, with the line of text “Hello World From Edge Delivery Services.”
We added a metadata table at the bottom of the document, and the entries became metadata on the final web page.
We added JavaScript to the hero block to allow the hero to contain two distinct images: one for mobile and one for desktop. The picture element selected these depending on the viewport size. We created the bio block from scratch, with styling to create a circular overlay and to pick up the author's name from either the alt tag in the img element and, if not present, obtain the author’s name from the author meta element from the page. We added a class name ‘highlighted’ to our Bio block and the CSS to put an outline on the image.
Continuing the journey
Our manager has asked that we follow the image with some text with brief biographical details, including the author's name. Thus, we no longer need the author's name automatically provided underneath the picture. This is another variation.
The cell in the block name is currently Bio (highlighted). The word bio is the block name and also the class name used to create the element and its wrappers; looking at the rendered HTML in the browser after Edge Delivery Services has run, one of the first things to note is that the blocks we created have been rendered in a div with a section class.
<div class="section hero-container bio-container columns-container" data-section-status="loaded" style="">
The div also has classes for each block in the document, postfixed with -container. There is a data-section-status class that is adjusted by edge delivery and, finally, an empty style; we will return to section styles later. Further down, we see the bio-block
In the snippet of HTML, the block is decorated with a -wrapper <div class="bio-wrapper">, and the next div is decorated with the block name ‘bio’ and the variation ‘highlighted’ along with a ‘block’ class.
<div class="bio highlighted block" data-block-name="bio" data-block-status="loaded">
All blocks are decorated this way: block name, variations applied and then ‘block’. This makes it easy to target slices of the HTML using classes; Edge Delivery Services does not use IDs.
Hiding the auto-generated author-name
Our task is to hide the author, so adding a new class name, “hide author”, is done by adding a second phrase after a comma within the brackets. All spaces in the block/styling phrase are replaced with hyphens (-)
Investigating the rendered HTML.
<div class="bio highlighted hide-author block" data-block-name="bio" data-block-status="loaded">
We can adjust the CSS or JS to make this class work. I chose to adjust the javascript, adding a test for the non-existence of the class ‘hide-author.’
if (!bioElement.classList.contains("hide-author")) {
…. Original code
}
The final Javascript function
Place the text to the right.
The next task was to allow text to the right of our bio picture. Insert a new column, merge the title and add the text.
Previewing could be better; the text is underneath.
It looks OK, but we wanted something else. We want the text to be to the right. Adding CSS to bio.css to involve a flex layout does the trick.
We adjusted the first and last child of the DIVs to make it work.
Reusing content
Content Management Systems often reuse pieces of text and assets; Edge Delivery Services include this functionality; these are called fragments.
I create fragments in a folder called fragments in my Google Drive. We want boilerplate text at the foot of our pages, similar to the ‘Want to know more’ at the bottom of these articles.
We create the fragment.
And add the content
We need to include this fragment in our page by adding a fragment block with the path of the fragment.
When previewed, we can now see the fragment on our page.
The ‘want to know more’ fragment is displayed on the page; it is interesting to see how Edge Delivery Services provides this snippet; we inspect the network traffic.
This time, you can see the fetch/xhr content in my filter, and the fragment component asked for want-to-know-more-plain.html instead of Edge Delivery providing a page with styling, javascript, <body>, <main>, etc.; it just provided the raw HTML in a div ready for adding to the page; where it will inherit the styling and context of the page.
Looking more carefully, you wiil also see footer.plain.html and nav.plain.html
These are ‘auto fragments’ generated from the footer and nav documents placed in the root folder of Google Drive. This gives the website a consistent set of headers and footers.
I want my allabout.network to be focussed on telling people ‘all about’ something, such as this tutorial, without third-party distractions. Therefore, I have also chosen not to have footers or navigation; you can easily create your navigation and footers and have them auto-included as fragments.
Styling the pages
There are three ways to style your pages.
Use the default autoblock style.
Change nothing; get the style verbatim from styles.css. You can view and change the styles in styles.css for your project. Note that the style sheets in Edge Delivery use CSS 3 with variables; it does not require bundling, compiling, or transpilation.
Use a theme
After applying the theme's name to your metadata table, Edge Delivery Services will apply the theme class to the body. Then, you can change the styling for this page using the theme as a modifier; for instance, a newsletter page could have a theme of ‘newsletter’; as I am writing an article, I will give this page a theme of ‘article’.
Edge Delivery Services applies the theme class to the body element.
<body class=”article”>
One can use different styles on this page, such as margin padding.
Note that the body class has a display: none; when Edge Delivery finishes loading the page, it changes the display attribute by adding a class “appear” with a display “block”
Use sections
Sections are parts of the page; they are marked by ‘---’ 3 hyphens on a line by themselves and have a section metadata table.
Preview the page
The rendered HTML for a section looks like this:
The description metadata is used as a data-description attribute in the section div. You can use these data descriptions to decorate the HTML further, but this will be custom code.
The Hello World page is here.https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/hello-world-2

Strategic AEM Architecture - Why Framework Thinking Beats Feature Chasing
Independent AEM consultant available for advisory engagements, freelance projects, and part-time roles - not seeking full-time positions. After many years architecting AEM solutions, I've learned that successful platforms are built on strategic frameworks, not technical features.
Global Architecture That Scales
The world's largest AEM implementation taught me something crucial about strategic thinking. When Nissan-Renault needed 200+ websites across 30+ languages for five automotive brands, the challenge wasn't technical - it was creating architectural frameworks that could work consistently across different markets, teams, and requirements.
We developed decision-making frameworks that helped distributed teams make consistent choices without constant consultation. Performance standards that worked across different content types. Governance models that balanced corporate control with regional flexibility. When you're coordinating 15 teams and architects across four continents, strategy becomes the foundation everything else builds on.
This approach has shaped every major project since. At EE, it prevented platform crashes during high-traffic product launches. At MediaMonks, it enabled custom design frameworks that traditional AEM couldn't support. The principle remains consistent: strategic foundations create space for tactical excellence.
AI Integration Strategy That Works
Current conversations about AI and content management often focus on capabilities rather than strategy. Teams get excited about automated content generation or intelligent tagging without considering how these tools fit into existing workflows or impact content quality.
I focus on AI-enhanced processes that amplify human creativity rather than replace it. We're developing governance frameworks for automated content that ensure brand consistency while improving efficiency. The key insight is understanding where AI adds genuine value versus where it creates unnecessary complexity.
Edge Delivery Services represent another strategic opportunity. The performance benefits are significant, but implementation requires careful evaluation of operational complexity and team capabilities. I help organisations develop frameworks for making informed decisions about when and how to integrate these technologies.
Capability Building Through Mentoring
Technical solutions are temporary. Team capabilities are permanent. My mentoring approach focuses on building strategic thinking skills that help teams navigate future challenges independently.
At MediaMonks, I established their first AEM practice from scratch. Rather than just delivering technical solutions, we developed architectural patterns that preserved their exceptional design standards while leveraging AEM's content management strengths. The teams I worked with went on to deliver outstanding results for Twitter and many others.
At Ford, mentoring centered on headless AEM implementations and translation workflow integration. The goal wasn't just successful project delivery - it was ensuring teams understood the architectural decisions well enough to maintain and evolve the solutions over time.
This knowledge transfer approach means organisations build internal expertise that reduces long-term dependency on external consultants while improving decision-making capabilities across the team.
Strategic Plan Reviews
Some of my most valuable work happens before implementation begins. Plan reviews often reveal gaps between intention and reality - marketing requirements that conflict with performance goals, AI integration proposals that ignore workflow constraints, architectural approaches that create future operational challenges.
These sessions focus on asking the right questions early. How do proposed features align with existing content processes? What new capabilities will teams need to develop? Where might seemingly simple requirements create complex implementation challenges?
The goal is identifying potential issues while solutions are still flexible and cost-effective. Strategic review at the planning stage prevents problems that become expensive to solve during implementation.
Industry Leadership and Knowledge Sharing
As a member of Boye & Company's CMS Experts Group and regular industry speaker, I stay connected with emerging trends while contributing insights from real-world implementations. This dual perspective helps clients understand where the industry is heading while making strategic decisions based on proven approaches.
The "AEM Guy" reputation in CMS circles comes from consistently translating complex technical concepts into strategic guidance that drives successful outcomes. Whether explaining architectural trade-offs to executives or helping teams evaluate new technologies, the focus remains on practical strategic thinking.
Independent Strategic Partnership
Since August 2022, I've worked exclusively as an independent consultant through Digital Domain Technologies. This allows me to focus on strategic engagements where experience and objectivity make the most difference.
Recent clients each bring distinct challenges that benefit from strategic review and architectural guidance. The common thread is organisations seeking strategic partnership rather than tactical delivery.
I'm available for advisory engagements, freelance opportunities, and part-time consulting roles - but not seeking full-time positions. This approach allows me to provide focused expertise when and where it's needed most, whether that's a strategic review, implementation guidance, or ongoing architectural mentorship.
Whether you need architectural strategy development, AI integration planning, team capability building, or plan reviews, the approach remains consistent: helping teams make better strategic decisions that create long-term success rather than short-term fixes.
Strategic advantage in digital transformation comes from having the right frameworks in place before you need them. That's where experienced advisory partnership makes the difference.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 3
Spreadsheets
Indexing
Spreadsheets and Json
Query parameters
Redirects
.helix folder
This is part 3 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.
Previously
We extended ‘Hello World’ with style variations on the bio block, added fragments, and discussed styling in more depth.
Next - We can use spreadsheets, not just documents.
Within Google Drive or Sharepoint, you can upload or create spreadsheets in Excel or Google Sheets format. If you are using Google Drive, remember to change your settings to convert Excel to Google Sheets automatically,How to Convert Multiple Word Documents/Sheets to Google Docs.
Using spreadsheets
Spreadsheets are versatile tools that can be used for various purposes. In this post, we will explore some of the most common uses for spreadsheets, including:
Source of JSON for your website: Spreadsheets can create JSON data that populates Edge Delivery Services pages or another website using ‘headless technologies’ such as react.js. They are a convenient way to store and manage data that needs to be displayed on a website.
Notification of events from Edge Delivery Services: Spreadsheets can be used to receive notifications of events from Edge Delivery Services. This can be useful for monitoring your website's performance or troubleshooting issues. The Spreadsheets created can be used on your website; we will demo this.
Configuration of Edge Delivery Services: Spreadsheets can be used to configure Edge Delivery Services. This optimises your website's performance or enables specific features like headers, metadata, and authentication.
1 Use a spreadsheet as a source of JSON for websites.
One can create a spreadsheet in MS Excel and upload it to Google Drive or create one directly inside Google Drive. For the demo, we will create a fortune cookie block in our document that displays a random cookie from a JSON file named cookies.
In Google Drive, create a folder named /data; in that folder, create a sheet named cookies.
The first row of the sheet becomes the json attribute names.
We now want a list of cookies, and I will get chatGPT to give me a list of 9
Press the preview button in the sidekick to see a nice json layout; I use json view.
Investigating the structure of the json.
The JSON structure consists of an object with several properties:
1. "total": A number representing the total count of data elements.
2. "offset": A number indicating the starting position of the data subset.
3. "limit": A number specifying the maximum number of data elements in this subset.
4. "data": An array containing the actual data elements. Each element is an object with two properties:
- "key": A string representing the message's short title
- "value": A string containing the actual message.
5. ":type": A string indicating the type of data, in this case, "sheet", the source of the data
In simple terms:
- The object has metadata about the data set, including the total number of elements, the offset and limit for this subset of data (useful for pagination), and the data type.
- The actual data is in the "data" array.
All JSON derived from spreadsheets in Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services share the same formatting; the main json is in the ‘data’ element, and everything else is metadata.
We would like to build a fortune cookie block.
Start by creating a table ‘FortuneCookie’ in our Hello World document.
Remember that the name cell, the only cell in the case above, is changed to lowercase when used in Edge Delivery Services.
In our GitHub, we need to createblocks/fortunecookie/fortunecookie.css and
blocks/fortunecookie/fortunecookie.js
The code in fortunecookie.js will use the browser's fetch command to read the json, generate a random number, use that number to pluck a key and a value, and then place the results in the block.
Viewing the page
We now have a Fortune Cookie on our page. When someone presses preview and publish, you can add any JSON to your pages using spreadsheets.
Spreadsheets and JSON
In addition to translating Google Docs and Word documents into markdown and HTML markup, AEM also translates spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel workbooks and Google Sheets) into JSON files that your website or web application can easily consume.
This enables many uses for content that is table-oriented or structured.
Sheets and Sheet Structure.
The simplest example of a sheet consists of a table that uses the first row as column names and the subsequent rows as data, as seen above.
Edge Delivery Services allows you to manage workbooks with multiple sheets.
If there is only one sheet, Edge Delivery Services will use that sheet as the default source of information.
Edge Delivery Services will only deliver sheets with sheet names prefixed with helix if there are multiple sheets. This lets you keep additional information and possibly formulas in the same spreadsheet that will not be delivered to the web.
If there is a sheet named helix-default, it is delivered if no additional query parameters are supplied.
See the following for details on how to query a specific sheet.
Query Parameters
Offset and Limit
Spreadsheets and JSON files can become very large. Edge Delivery Services supports limit and offset query parameters in such cases to indicate which spreadsheet rows are delivered.
As Edge Delivery Services always compresses the JSON, payloads are generally relatively small. Therefore, if the limit query parameter is not specified, the Edge Delivery Services limits the number of rows it returns to 1000 by default. This is sufficient for many simple cases.
Sheet
The sheet query parameter allows an application to specify one or multiple specific sheets in the spreadsheet or workbook. For example,?sheet=jobs will return the sheet named helix-jobs, and ?sheet=jobs&sheet=articles will return the data for helix-jobs and helix-articles.
2 Notification of events from Edge Delivery Services
The empty sheet
Edge Delivery Services keeps a json index of all published pages; in Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services, you can have a copy of this index by creating a sheet in the root folder of your document store. This sheet must be named query-index and have a single sheet named raw_index. The columns are path, title, image, description and lastmodified. You can choose to add others like ‘author’. See indexing
When you publish a page, Edge Delivery automatically enters it into this spreadsheet with updated attributes and publishes the sheet. It's a two-way traffic sheet.
Using this documentation website as an example
And when we preview
This json file can be used in Edge Delivery Services to create dynamic blocks, where the content is pulled from a json file.
Creating a BlogList, using index-query.json
We added a bloglist block to the document.
We will create the bloglist code at
/blocks/bloglist/bloglist.css and/blocks/bloglist/bloglist.js
Bloglist Javascript
The javascript will also use fetch, similar to the fortunecookie block. We want to obtain the json, restrict it to just my blogs, sort by title, and then restrict the final json to three entries. You can see four entries in the sample above.
Create the BlogList style
Previewing the page
3 Configuring Edge Delivery Services
Edge Delivery Services is controlled in many ways; spreadsheets are the content Author-friendly way of performing this task.
Redirects
You can see that we created a query-index sheet in our root folder. This two-way sheet receives information from the publishing process and can be used to create dynamic content for your pages.
Edge Delivery Services also has a sheet named redirects, which creates the json entity redirects.json
In this sheet, we have two columns: Source and Destination.
I made the mistake of creating my blogs in the root folder of my Google Drive and not naming them similarly, so I moved them to a subtree ‘/blogs/ddt’ and created the redirects sheet in the root of the folder.
I also deleted the original pages, so you are redirected to the new destination when you ask for the older location: nice one, Adobe. Thinking about your hierarchy before you begin is preferable, but knowing that you can change it afterwards is nice.
The .helix folder
You can control the inner workings of Edge Delivery services using the folder named .helix
Note the ‘.’ -- it is dot-helix .helix
Note the name is a previous code name for this technology. The dot in front makes this folder unservable from the internet, which is excellent for secrets like how you are configuring Edge Delivery Services. You could think of the ‘.’ as just like the dot in Unix -- files are hidden!!
Anyway, the files you create in this folder are used for configuring Helix
Headers
The sheet ‘headers’, which in turn ought to create headers,json - you cannot see this file, contains the key and value of the headers you want to send out with your web pages.
My headers contain a content security policy, which helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.Link to CSP Description on Mozilla
Bringing up the sidekick
When you click on preview, instead of a new set of options, including publish, you get a transient sign ‘Configuration successfully activated’.
Because this is in the .helix folder, it does not need publishing -- it is not visible to the internet.
Config
The next sheet to look at is config; you put exciting things here for your configuration.
Part of mine is shown below; keys and secrets are here to configure CDN and caching; you can also configure authentication. I will not show you my samples for the obvious reasons.
You can find more info about the ‘.helix’ folder and metadata config here.

My next post will be about tips and tricks with Json, including building a react application inside Edge Delivery Services.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 4
Building an SPA app with Json
This is part 4 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. This time, we will create an SPA app.
Previously
We demonstrated how spreadsheets can serve as a JSON source for websites and Edge Delivery Services, as well as for notifications and configuration purposes.
Part 4 - Building an App with Json
I will first create an application in Edge Delivery Services and then extend this to a React application. Edge Delivery Services supports react and vue; one does not get the perfect 100,100,100,100 lighthouse scoring when we move to Single Page Applications (SPAs), though we get enhanced user interactions. This article shows how Edge Delivery Services can assist customers in building the best of both worlds. Architects should ensure that the home, campaign, and direct landing pages are built with pure Edge Delivery Services code; secondary pages can be more interactive, keeping the website's performance high. Like all rules, you can choose to disregard this one.
The app we build will demonstrate that Edge Delivery Services is not just for static pages.
Specification of the App
The app is a slideshow designed for content authors who create individual pages.
In a ‘traditional CMS, ’ this would probably be a pool of images in an extendable component, which is difficult for a content author to use. We will build a design focused on the content author.
Each page will also serve as a standalone entity, with a visually appealing slide image complemented by detailed textual content. The code's primary objective is to extract metadata from each page, represented as a JSON object. This metadata is then employed to showcase the slides in a continuous scrolling format, providing users with an immersive experience; each slide is linked to its corresponding page, enabling seamless navigation for users seeking additional information or exploring the content in greater depth.This feature enhances the user experience by allowing easy access to supplementary materials, fostering a more interactive and informative environment.
Creating the documents
Create a folder ‘slides’ in the root folder of our Google Drive, and create our page in this folder.
As a subject, I will create slides about York, the English city where I live. I will create five pages with images and information. The code will not be restricted to five pages; use as many.
My pages will be simple to show the context of creating an SPA, and the layout will be
Title, Image, Descriptive text, Metadata
Similar to this, each page is different, and it will expand on the text.
Accessing the pages
Query-index
Have all pages been created? Add a query-index spreadsheet in the folder. We covered this in part three when we created a query-index in the root folder. As a reminder, we want a blank like this.
Now, preview and publish the pages.
Edge Delivery Services populates the query-index
We can look at the json
We should create the landing page.
“Five things to do in York, England”
In this page we added a single block ‘slide builder’; which will contain the JavaScript and styling for our SPA.
Remember that Edge Delivery Services replace non-printing and strange characters with hyphens; we need to create our files in
/blocks/slide-builder/slide-builder.css
/blocks/slide-builder/slide-builder.js
The JS is the first thing I will create. We use ‘fetch’ to obtain the json from our query-index in the slides folder of the Google Drive, iterate over every entry and make the initial page markup.
We will develop the code step by step.
As usual, we start with our export statement; it is good practice to do this
We have started with a query to check if WebP, high-speed images, is supported.
We will layer this up as we go through the tutorial.
Fetch the slides
There are two functions here; the first fetch retrieves the query-index inside the /slides/ folder, which lists the published slide we saw in the json above.
However, each slide page has information we want for the SPA, a hero-type image with variations for mobile, etc., as well as the intro paragraph and detailed paragraphs; we need to pick those up too. We bypass this in a mobile view (viewport <800). In the mobile view, the html is replaced by a null. The fetchSlideHtml function appends ‘.plain.html’ to the path; this signals to Edge Delivery Services to treat the page as a fragment and only return plain html without a header footer or any javascript - just plain html.
If returned, it is stored in the json for later use.
Next step, add the slides.
We Iterate over the json and call functions to build our app; we use an intersection observer feature to lazy load our images. That bit that says rootMargin: 100px is the wiggle room for our image coming into view.
Create each slide
The createSlideItem function builds all of the html necessary to display an individual slide, adding a click handler, which creates a panel; if we are running on a desktop, it adds additional supporting text (the first paragraph from the HTML) to the slide.
This technique speeds up mobile whilst keeping the desktop view enriched. The design is mobile-first, desktop-enriched.
The CreatePanel Function
In the createPanel we check to see if the HTML is present to display; if not we fetch it. Remember it is not present on the mobile view; keeping this responsive and fast. We add the controls to dismiss the panel.
FetchSupportingText Function
If present, the FetchSupportingText function reads the HTML from the html node of the Json, parses it with the Dom Parser, and extracts the first paragraph after the first h2 element. This is an essential technique in Edge Delivery Services; the web uses modern JavaScript, and the browsers fully support parsing DOM structures. Edge Delivery services treat the DOM as a first-class citizen, tying this with ‘plain.html’, and developers have a rich resource set.
Setting the background image
Two things are happening here: the url is constructed from the original image url, which was present in the metadata, and therefore, the image node of the json. We use the supportsWebP variable to adjust the image for WebP serving from Edge Delivery, set width and optimise level through a query string. We go for the original image if the browser does not support WebP.
Notice that we have img.onload and image.onerror functions to support lazy loading.
That was a lot to cover
Here is the complete listing
Completing the ask, the CSS
Phew, that is complicated; by breaking it into smaller pieces, I hope you see that the design fits together and you will be able to build SPA Applications with query-index.json and .plain.html
We kept excellent lighthouse scores despite using lots of fetch and stitching together. Edge Delivery Services is a beautiful tool.
The finished Spa App is here Five things to do in York, England (allabout.network)
In contrast, we can convert this into a ReactJS application and serve it directly from Edge Delivery Services, which will be the next part of this series.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 5
Building a ReactJS app
This is part 5 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. This time, we will create a React App that uses Edge Delivery Services as the data source.
Previously
We created a SPA app using Documents as the data source and a document with a block to serve the content.
Part 5 - Building a React app with documents as the source
As a developer, you may be more familiar with ReactJs and want to use those skills in Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. You may also have an existing ReactJs app that you want to bring into the Edge Delivery Services Infrastructure. Whatever your reason, this tutorial will help you use ReactJs with Edge Delivery.
I walk you through converting the slide builder block we built in part 4 into a modular React app. We'll cover the key steps and considerations to ensure a smooth transition.
1. Understanding the Original Structure
The original approach consisted of a block consisting of a single JavaScript file (slide-builder.js) and a corresponding CSS file (slide-builder.css). While this monolithic approach worked well within the Edge Delivery Services ecosystem, it needs modularity to work well with React.
2. Breaking Down the Components
The first step in our conversion is to identify the main components of our application:
- SlideBuilder: The main container for all slides
- SlideItem: Individual slide components
- SlidePanel: The panel that opens when a slide is clicked
3. Setting Up the React Project
Start by creating a new React project. You can use Create React App or your preferred React boilerplate.
After creating a new React project with the Create React App, you can streamline your project by removing several files that aren't necessary for our conversion. Here's a list of files you can safely delete:
1. In the `src` folder:
- `App.test.js` (We are a tutorial, no tests. Do this later)
- `logo.svg` (the React logo, which we won't be using)
- `reportWebVitals.js` (we will not need web vitals reporting)
- `setupTests.js` (no tests, see above)
2. In the `public` folder:
- `logo192.png` and `logo512.png` (React logos)
- `manifest.json` (We are not building a Progressive Web App)
- we can delete favicon.ico
- `robots.txt`
Rename index.html to slides.html
After cleaning up, your project structure might look like this:
This cleaned-up structure provides a good starting point for implementing your converted React application. You can now add your new components and styles to the `src` folder. The final project structure will end up like this.
The full code is here https://github.com/ddttom/react-with-eds
The index.html
Now app.js
Instead of directly fetching data in the decorate function, I used React's useEffect hook in the App component to fetch slide data when the component mounts.
app.css
We employ hooks such as React, useState, and useEffect in React. Additionally, we integrate the SlideBuilder component and the App.css file. The App function component serves as the foundation of our application. With the assistance of the useState hook, we effectively manage the "slides" state. To retrieve slide data upon component mounting, we utilize the useEffect hook. The fetchSlides function, an asynchronous operation, acquires slide data from the "/slides/query-index.json" endpoint. The component structure encompasses a header and a primary section. Within the central section, the SlideBuilder component is rendered, passing slide data as a property.
index.js, remove core web vitals
Change README.md
4. Creating React Components
Now, let's create our React components:
- src/components/SlideBuilder.js
- src/components/SlideItem.js
- src/components/SlidePanel.js
Don’t worry about dangerouslySetInnerHTML. I only obtained a text node in the first place.
Each component encapsulates its logic and render method.
The core logic from the original `decorate` function was distributed among these components:
- Moved slide fetching logic to the main App component
- Implemented background image loading in SlideItem
- Handled panel opening/closing in SlideItem and SlidePanel
5. Styling
Create separate CSS files for each component:
- src/styles/SlideBuilder.css
- src/styles/SlideItem.css
- src/styles/SlidePanel.css
Build the output
To distribute your React application, you must create a production build and then deploy it. Here's a step-by-step guide on what you need to do:
Create a Production Build:
In your project directory, run the following:
This command creates a build directory with a production build of your app.
The build directory will contain:
To distribute your app, you need to serve the contents of the build directory.
Returning to our Edge Delivery Services repository, it looks similar to the archetypal boilerplate.
Copy the internal part of the build folder, the static folder and the index.html to the root of the Edge Delivery Repo
Rename index.html to slides.html
Now, the Repo is integrated, as seen below.
We have added slides.html and the static directory.
Now commit and push your Repo.
Conclusion
Converting an Edge Delivery Services block to a React application involves breaking down the monolithic structure into reusable components, adapting the logic to work with React's lifecycle and hooks, and ensuring that all functionality is preserved. While it requires some effort, the result is an extensible codebase that leverages the power of React's component-based architecture. I prefer the block format; this tutorial is to help give you options.
Remember, this conversion is just the beginning. Once in React, you can further enhance your application with additional features, optimize performance, and integrate with other React libraries and tools. If your customer already has a ReactJS application, a calculator, or something more sophisticated, you can easily integrate this into your Edge Delivery Services site collection.
The final ReactJS application served directly from GitHub, cannot be previewed using the sidekick and thus cannot be published through it. Despite this, it is live. You can view it here https://allabout.network/slides.html
The full code is here https://github.com/ddttom/react-with-eds

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 6
Json and GitHub
A bit more info on Json, using GitHub as a fallback for sheets
This is part 6 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services; this time, we will investigate Json and The GitHub connection.
Previously
We created a SPA app using Documents as the data source and a document with ReactJS to serve the content.
Part 6 - Json and Github
Edge Delivery Services can create an index of published material; one uses a Google sheet/ Microsoft Excel sheet to do this work. Full details here Indexing (www.aem.live)
If we provide the blank query index in the notes folder, they are entered into the sheet as shown when Edge Delivery Servies creates published pages.
Then the json is produced by the url main--allaboutv2--ddttom.hlx.live/notes/query-index.json
We discussed all of this in an earlier article, in part 3.
The critical thing to note is the structure of the json returned from the sheet; we can create json from a sheet by creating titles and cell entries like this.
This, in turn, will provide simple json
In edge delivery services, any json that is provided in the root folder with the path name of header.json is applied to the website. Edge Delivery Services will use these headers for the paths mentioned in the url element. Note the wildcard. Custom HTTP Response Headers (www.aem.live)
You may not want to give content authors complete control over the headers; it is a complex subject with wildcarding and key/value entries. I suggest making this a developer's responsibility.
If you create a matching headers.json in your code editor and add it to the GitHub root folder, then GitHub will be used if the sheet has yet to be created. The beauty of Edge Delivery services is that if the user is technical and aware of the technique to create their sheet, they can do so, and their version of the json will override the developer-provided one. I use this technique in my development of Edge Delivery Services Projects.
I have configuration information in a file named /config/defaults.json in my GitHub.
I have kept the generated JSON original layout as if I had created it on a sheet. However, I have changed the type to ‘fallback’ so that I can debug it later.
If we need to change things on production without releasing new code, we just have to create a new sheet named defaults with all the information, including the changes and then publish it.
Other sheets used in Edge Delivery Services are
Metadata (Bulk Metadata (www.aem.live))
Redirects (Redirects (www.aem.live))
Config (Project Configuration (www.aem.live)) is a particular item in a special folder. It cannot be served on the web and cannot be previewed.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 7
Useful Components
Blocks I use in my guides.
Index
Returntotop
Bloglist
I explain the additional blocks I use in my guides.
Previously
We discussed Google Sheets/ Excel spreadsheets, Edge Delivery Services automatic conversion to Json, and the ability to create fallbacks in Github.
Part 7 - Useful Components
In building this series, I have created three blocks (or components, in old CMS speak) that help provide navigation widgets.
Index - provides an expanding index of the topics in the article.
Returntotop - provides a back-to-top button when the reader scrolls away from the opening viewport.
Bloglist - provides a list of related articles.
Code-expander - extends autoblocking for <code></code> elements
Each block is designed to be intuitive for the user and easy for the content author, automating the work. The content author just has to place the item in the correct place in the document, as a block fragment, queued in by a table. The code achieves this functionality using vanilla JavaScript, CSS 3 and DOM manipulation; no frameworks or libraries are involved - this is the perfect way to create Edge Delivery Services blocks (components).
returntotop
I will begin with the simplest one, returntotop
The function makes the "Back to Top" button visible when the user scrolls down over 100 pixels. When the button is clicked, the page smoothly scrolls back to the top.
This block has two cells: the first one is the block name, and the second is the content. The content is the wording the author wants to use when it is displayed; one may wish to use different phrasing or say it in French; it is up to the content author.
As always, create the folder returntotop under the blocks folder, then make two files returntotop.css and returntotop.js
returntotop.css contains the styling.
.
The returntotop.js contains the code.
It adds an event listener to the window object that listens for the scroll event. The button is displayed when the user scrolls down more than 100 pixels (display: 'block'). Otherwise, the button is hidden (display: 'none').
index
Once again, create a folder inside blocks called index and two files, index.css and index.js, in this folder.
Index.css should contain
And index.js
This code creates an interactive webpage index by selecting all header elements (h1 to h6) and the index block. It creates an index header with a clickable arrow and an index content container. The index is built lazily - only when the user first clicks on the index header. Clicking the index header toggles the visibility of the index content and rotates the arrow.
The buildIndex function creates a list of links to all headers on the page, indenting them based on their header level (h1, h2, etc.). Each header is given a unique ID, and the index links are created to point to these IDs.
Finally
bloglist
Create a folder inside blocks called bloglist and then add the two files bloglist.css and bloglist.js.
Bloglist.css
This CSS creates a responsive blog list layout, using CSS Grid for the blog list, with auto-fitting columns. Each blog item is a flex container with a border. Blog images are set to a fixed height with full width. The last modified date is pushed to the bottom with a separator line. On mobile (< 600px), it switches to a single-column layout.
The Javascript file
Javascript fetches blog data from "/query-index.json," filters blog items to include only those with "developer-guide" in the path, sorts the filtered items alphabetically by title, generates HTML content for the blog list, and inserts the generated content into the DOM.
code-expander
The Code Expander block adds a copy-to-clipboard functionality to all <code> elements in the document.
Usage
This block automatically enhances all <code> elements on the page, so no specific usage in the content is required.
Authoring
Authors can continue to use the standard <code> element in their content by applying the courier font to a block of ‘code’.
The expander is agitated by adding a simple block to the page.
The Code Expander block will automatically add the copy-to-clipboard functionality, an icon and a copy-to-clipboard text.
Like this
Styling
The block uses the following CSS classes:
.code-expander-wrapper: Wraps the entire component (copy button and code)
.code-expander-copy: Styles the copy button
.code-expander-copy-text: Styles the "Copy code" text
.code-expander-code: Wraps the code element for additional styling control
The <pre> element within .code-expander-code has a light background for visual distinction.
Behavior
A "Copy code" button with a clipboard icon (📋) is added above each <code> element.
The code is displayed within a <pre> element with a light background for better visual separation.
Clicking the button copies the code content to the clipboard.
The button text changes to "Copied!" with a checkmark (✅) for 2 seconds after successful copying.
Accessibility
The copy button has appropriate aria-label attributes for screen readers.
The button's state changes are reflected in the aria-label for accessibility.
code-expander.js
Code-expander.css

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 8
Using AI with Edge Delivery Services
So, if you want to use AI with EDS, aka Helix or Franklin
You will end up with an AI agent that writes Edge Delivery Services code for you, generating code from text or screenshots.
I explain how to use AI effectively with Edge Delivery Services.
Previously
I opened up my useful components.
Part 8 - Using AI with Edge Delivery Services
I constructed this series just as AI became popular, especially for developers creating code. So, I was tempted. I tried writing with AI—this was an abysmal experience, so I had to hand-craft these pieces. You might detect the odd bit of wandering, repeats, and typos. I did have Grammarly on hand to help. I used Cursor.ai to create my examples; they were not generated raw by AI, but AI assisted my programming.
Using Claude without training
Let us see what happens if you jump into Claude and ask for programming code from Claude for Franklin.
Now, this is not intelligent. It has no clue what I meant by Franklin. It knows block and accordion and then hallucinates that we want ‘a react component’. No, we don't. We need plain modern JavaScript and CSS3.
Perhaps the word Franklin is not working; try again
Same answer.
Training Claude
Ok, so we need to train Claude. There are three good sources of training material,
Adobe Experience Manager (www.aem.live)
Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services - Part 0 (allabout.network)
Your Repo, or perhaps you are starting from scratch GitHub - adobe/aem-boilerplate: Use this repository template for new AEM projects.
When I started writing Part 8 (this part), I realised I had not given enough context for an AI to understand what I was doing; therefore, I wrote Part 0 to fill in the gap. I also needed to provide more background for humans.
The aem.live site is good and covers the topic well, but it is not something one can feed to an AI.
So, I wrote a site scraper that extracts the text elements and links in a site by scraping and caching the web page; it extracts the text elements from a page (ignoring navigation), extracts all links (including navigation), and marks the ones that have been followed. As it goes along, It writes to a text file.
The source code for my scraper, which extracts relevant text pieces from an entire site
NodeJs src for a scraper that constructs a document to train AI.
And the config.js that informs exclusions
I ran this code against aem.live and Part 0 of this tutorial; it diligently created files that contained the site's essence.
Adding the correct parts of your repo to the AI training
The final part of the training is the work already done, your repo.
The AI should be interested in the blocks you have added to your repo and the base style sheets.
I wrote another nodejs app that scans your folders and builds instructable text from CSS, JS, and MD. I believe in using MD files next to blocks to keep documentation within the implementation.
NodeJs src for a scanner that collects JS, CSS, and MD.
I ran this
Creating the final training file
I have five more manually created files, which provide context for the machine-generated files.
developer-front.txt
system-block-ai-front.txt
system-block-ai-foot.txt
Finally, my Readme.txt places them all in the correct order; I have named the result file all.out to remind me it is not just a plain text file. It contains magic.
Cat.sh and ReadMe.txt
This Unix/Linux shell command combines the contents of multiple text files into a single output file. Let's break it down:
1. `cat`: This command concatenates (combines) and displays the contents of files.
2. The files being combined are:
- `aem-live-result.txt`
- `system-developer-front.txt`
- `developer-guide.txt`
- `system-block-ai-front.txt`
- `block-ai-result.txt`
- `system-block-ai-foot.txt`
3. `>`: This is an output redirection operator. It takes the output that would normally be displayed on the screen and instead writes it to a file.
4. `all.out` is the name of the output file to which the combined contents of all the input files will be written.
So, when you run this command, it will:
1. Read the contents of the files in the correct order.
2. Concatenating all of their contents.
3. Write the combined content to a new file named `all.out`.
If `all.out` exists, its contents will be overwritten. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.
This takes all of the files Tom Cranstoun created and turns them into an `all.out` file for Claude or other AI.
When added as context, this turns Claude into an agent that can create blocks for Adobe Edge Delivery Services (AKA Franklin or Helix)
If you want your repo (`block-ai.txt`) or training, you can replace any files except 'system-XXXX--xxx.txt' and rerun.
The file all.out is uploaded to Claude, and the question is given again.
Claude does the trick, including a README.md for the component.
You do not need to create your training files; you can use mine.
Here are the links to the Training texts.
Training Texts
You can cherry-pick, download the whole lot, or use the file all.out, which contains the magic.
With this training, you can also upload images and screenshots into Claude; Claude will then generate complex blocks for you.
I took this screenshot from my home screen on Edge (The browser, gosh, don’t you hate the way this industry names things)
I pasted into my trained Claude,
The first pass was not complete; it said things like​​function createFeaturedStories(stories) {
// Implementation for featured stories carousel
}
function createTopStories(stories) {
// Implementation for top stories list
}
function createNewsGrid(items) {
// Implementation for news items grid
}
I said, show me the code, and voila.
Note that I have trained Claude to use airbnb style guide, which is Adobe’s Linting in the GitHub pipeline; this code will pass the linting test.
New task
You now have an agent that can create Edge Delivery Services Blocks with a prompt and maybe a picture; this is a very handy tool. Remember that it is AI-generated, so mistakes can happen; check the code.
A reminder
You do not need to create your training files; you can use mine.
Here are the links to the Training texts.
Training Texts
You can cherry-pick, download the whole lot, or use the file all.out, which contains the magic.

Previously
My last article was Part 9 -Comprehensive Guide to AEM Edge Delivery Services Development
Beware the article below is huge, it's not called allabout.network for nothing!!
If you want the short version, also with video; switch to here: Short version
Introduction
First a demo
AI - Not just a buzzword.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is not just a buzzword—it's becoming an indispensable tool for innovation and efficiency in software development. This blog post dives deep into AI-assisted document authoring with Edge Delivery Services (EDS), exploring how we can harness the power of AI to accelerate development, ensure code consistency, reduce manual effort, and even automate documentation and testing processes.
The Challenge
Traditional development processes, not just those for Document Authoring with EDS, while effective, often involve repetitive tasks, time-consuming debugging, and the potential for inconsistencies across different developers or projects. As projects grow in complexity and scale, these challenges can lead to increased development time, higher costs, and potential quality issues.
Goals
I set out to achieve several key objectives:
Accelerate prototyping and development cycles
Ensure consistent code quality across projects
Reduce manual effort in repetitive tasks
Automate documentation generation
Enhance testing processes through AI-assisted content test creation
By leveraging AI in these areas, we aim to not only improve efficiency but also free up developers to focus on higher-level problem-solving and innovation.
The AI-Powered Development Stack
At the core of our AI-powered development approach lies a powerful combination of two key components:
Claude: An advanced AI model developed by Anthropic, which we've custom-trained using AEM.live documentation, developer guides, and existing repositories. Claude serves as our intelligent assistant, capable of understanding complex development concepts and generating code based on our prompts.
Cursor.ai: An innovative AI-powered Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that takes code assistance to the next level. Cursor.ai integrates seamlessly into the development workflow, offering context-aware suggestions and automating repetitive tasks.
These tools form the foundation of our AI-powered development stack, enabling us to push the boundaries of what's possible in web development and document authoring.
Deep Dive: Claude's Capabilities
Claude, as an AI language model, brings several unique capabilities to our development process:
Natural Language Understanding: Claude can interpret complex instructions and queries in natural language, making it easier for developers to communicate their intentions.
Contextual Awareness: Through our custom training, Claude has developed a deep understanding of EDS and AEM concepts, allowing it to generate appropriate code and suggestions.
Code Generation: From simple functions to complex components, Claude can generate code snippets, blocks, multiple blocks and full-on applications based on specified requirements.
Problem-Solving: When faced with development challenges, Claude can offer multiple solution approaches, complete with explanations of their pros and cons.
Documentation Assistance: Claude can generate initial documentation, code descriptions, and even user guides based on the code and context provided.
Cursor.ai: The AI-Enhanced IDE, out of the box
Cursor.ai takes the concept of an Integrated Development Environment to the next level by incorporating AI assistance directly into the coding interface. Key features include:
Intelligent Code Completion: Beyond simple syntax completion, Cursor.ai can suggest entire code blocks or functions based on the current context and project history.
Real-Time Code Analysis: As you type, Cursor.ai analyses your code, offering suggestions for improvements, identifying potential bugs, and even proposing optimizations, it's like copilot on steroids.
Natural Language Queries: Developers can ask questions or request features in natural language, and Cursor.ai will generate appropriate code snippets or provide relevant documentation.
AI-Powered Refactoring: Cursor.ai can suggest and even implement code refactoring to improve readability, performance, and maintainability.
Context-Aware Search: When you need to find specific code or functionality within your project, Cursor.ai's search function understands the context of your query, making it easier to locate relevant code.
Training Claude
Our path to leveraging AI effectively for Edge Delivery Services development was not without its challenges. Initially, Claude struggled to grasp the nuances of EDS, often producing incorrect or irrelevant code. This led us on a fascinating journey of AI training and refinement.
The Three-Part Context Structure
First of all understand the nature and contents of the training files
When working with AI, it's essential to structure your context to provide comprehensive information to the AI. This structure typically consists of Context files, Cursor Rules and The Prompt.
1. Top Level: The Context File
At the highest level, we have the context file. This file is the foundation, providing a broad overview of your project's technical landscape. It typically includes:
The framework you're using
Details about the development environment
Any specific tools, libraries, or techniques that are crucial to the project
This file gives AI a general understanding of the technological ecosystem within which it works.
2. Second Level: .cursorrules (in Cursor, your IDE may vary)
The rules file (.cursorrules file in cursor) bridges the general context and specific tasks. It outlines:
Project-specific requirements
Coding standards and best practices
Any constraints or guidelines that need to be followed
This file helps ensure the AI's output aligns with your project's specific needs and standards.
3. Bottom Level: Prompt for the AI
At the most granular level, we have the prompt sent to the AI. This is where you specify:
The exact task you want the AI to perform
Any specific details or parameters for the task
Desired output format or style
This prompt is tailored to each coding task, allowing you to leverage the AI's capabilities for various development needs.
Step 1: Website Scraping and Content Extraction
We began by developing a sophisticated tool to scrape websites and extract relevant content. This tool was designed with EDS's Eager-Lazy-Delayed loading mechanism in mind, allowing for a three-second delay to ensure the page settled before extracting the rendered content from the DOM.
Technical Deep Dive: The Scraping Tool
The scraping tool was built using NodeJs, and puppeteer.Key features of the tool include:
Intelligent Waiting: The tool implements a smart waiting mechanism that accounts for EDS's loading stages, ensuring all dynamic content is fully rendered before extraction.
Caching System: To minimise server load and improve efficiency, we implemented a file system-based caching system. This allows us to store and quickly retrieve previously scraped content.
Content Amalgamation: The tool doesn't just scrape individual pages; it intelligently combines content from multiple related pages into comprehensive, contextual documents. Whilst ignoring navigation, sidebars and a has a block-list to ensure it only accepts the correct URLs
Metadata Extraction: Beyond just content, the tool extracts and preserves important metadata such as page structure, component relationships, and content hierarchy.
This advanced scraping approach allowed us to build a rich, contextual dataset that formed the foundation of Claude's understanding of EDS.Example of the tool is in https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/developer-guide-to-document-authoring-with-edge-delivery-services-part-8
Step 2: Integrating AEM-Live Knowledge
Our next step was to feed Claude with information extracted from aem-live.com. This process involved:
Content Curation: We carefully selected the most relevant and up-to-date documentation from AEM-live, ensuring Claude had access to the latest best practices and features.
Structured Learning: The content was organised into a structured curriculum, starting with basic concepts and progressively moving to more advanced topics.
Interactive Training: We developed a series of test cases and scenarios based on AEM-live content, allowing us to assess and refine Claude's understanding through interactive problem-solving sessions. While this significantly improved Claude's understanding of AEM concepts, it revealed gaps in knowledge, particularly around how blocks are triggered in EDS. This realisation led us to our next step.
Step 3: Incorporating Blog Content
To bridge these knowledge gaps, we integrated content from a personal blog about developing for Document Authoring with EDS. This blog contained practical examples and introductory text, analysing both delivered and rendered HTML to explain the inner workings of EDS.
The "Hello World" Epiphany
During this process, we had a new realisation: if the AI struggled to comprehend the blog content, human readers might face similar challenges. This insight led to the creation of a 'Hello World' introduction (Part 0) to aid both AI and human understanding.
This "Hello World" guide broke down the EDS concepts into their most fundamental components, explaining:
The basic structure of an EDS project
How blocks are defined and triggered
The relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the EDS context
Step-by-step guide to creating and deploying a simple EDS component
By simplifying these concepts, we not only improved Claude's understanding but also created a valuable resource for newcomers to EDS development.
Step 4: Leveraging the Boilerplate Repository
To further enhance Claude's capabilities, we consolidated and improved JavaScript and CSS from the AEM Boilerplate GitHub repository. We incorporated our own blocks, including comprehensive README.md files, into the project.
Enhancing the Boilerplate
Our enhancements to the boilerplate repository included:
Modular Block Structure: We reorganised the blocks into a more modular structure, making it easier for both AI and human developers to understand and reuse components.
Comprehensive Documentation: Each block was accompanied by detailed documentation explaining its purpose, usage, and customization options.
Performance Optimizations: We implemented and documented best practices for performance, including lazy loading techniques and efficient CSS strategies.
Accessibility Enhancements: We integrated accessibility features into the boilerplate, ensuring that generated components would meet WCAG guidelines by default.
The Result: A "Super Context File"
The culmination of our training efforts was the creation of a "super context file." This file combined information from:
Curated content from AEM-live documentation
Practical examples and explanations from blog content
Enhanced boilerplate repository with modular blocks and comprehensive documentation
The super context file was structured with clear headers and footers, organised into logical sections that covered:
EDS fundamentals and architecture
Component development best practices
Performance optimization techniques
Accessibility guidelines
Common patterns and their implementations
Troubleshooting and debugging strategies
This comprehensive knowledge base significantly improved Claude's understanding of Edge Delivery Services, enabling it to generate more accurate, relevant, and optimised code.
I tested the super context file on claude web interface, the super context file is the Domain Knowledge file telling the AI
Creating the rules file
I created a rules file, the standard operating procedure for EDS Projects, this file explicitly tells cursor/claude the parameters I want to apply to the AI in this project, in particular I focus on

AI-Powered Development
Summarizes the key points from a recent presentation and explores how AI is revolutionizing the development process.
An introspection on a recent presentation
A Developer's Guide to AI-Assisted Block Creation for Adobe's Edge Delivery Services
Introduction
Welcome to my blog series, "A Developer's Guide to Developing with Document Authoring for Adobe's Edge Delivery Service." I'm Tom Cranstoun, and this post is aimed at Developers, Technical Content Authors, and PMs. Today, we'll explore how to use AI tools like Cursor and Claude to create blocks for Edge Delivery Services (formerly known as Franklin or Helix).
The Importance of Prompts in AI Work
Before we dive into the demonstration, I want to emphasize the crucial role of prompts in AI work. Think of prompts as programs written in English. Creating, saving, and managing them within your GitHub repository is essential for effective AI-assisted development.
Demonstration: Creating an Image Cycler Block
Let's walk through the process of using AI to create an image cycler (carousel) block for Edge Delivery Services.
Step 1: Preparing the Prompt
I start by using a pre-written prompt saved in my prompts folder. This prompt contains detailed instructions for creating the image cycler block.
Step 2: Using Cursor AI
Summon Cursor AI using the command shortcut.
Load the prompt file (in this case, image_cycler.md).
Execute the prompt, which instructs Cursor to create the necessary files (JavaScript, CSS, example, demo, and README).
Step 3: Reviewing and Accepting the Output
Cursor AI generates the files based on the prompt. Review the output and accept the changes, which will be written to your local repository.
Step 4: Pushing to GitHub
Commit the changes and push them to your GitHub repository.
Step 5: Examining the Generated Artifacts
The AI has created several files:
image_cycler.js: The main JavaScript file for the block
example.md: A markdown file with example usage
demo.md: A fully featured demo page
README.md: Documentation for developers and content authors
image_cycler.css: Styles for the image cycler
Step 6: Implementing in Edge Delivery Services
Copy the content from demo.md.
Paste it into a new Google Doc (which serves as a Franklin document).
The sidekick in Edge Delivery Services will recognize the markdown and format it appropriately.
Step 7: Previewing the Result
Preview the page to see the image cycler in action. It should display a set of randomly chosen images that rotate every 5 seconds, with hover and keyboard controls as specified.
Iterating and Improving with AI
We can continue to improve our block using AI:
Add navigation arrows to the image cycler.
Adjust the positioning of the arrows.
Change the background color.
Each of these improvements can be accomplished by giving new instructions to the AI, which will update the necessary files.
The Future of Development with AI
As we embrace AI in software development, it's important to understand that while coding as we know it may change, the essence of development remains. Here's how the role of developers will evolve:
Architecting solutions by listening to users and generating requirements
Designing frameworks and rules for AI
Crafting precise prompts
Reviewing AI-generated code
Conducting thorough testing
Iterating on the presentation
Documenting, presenting, releasing, and maintaining
The modern developer workflow becomes: plan, prompt, consult, verify, synchronize, document, test, and iterate.
Tips for Effective AI Prompts
Be specific and detailed in your prompts.
Cover all essential aspects: initialization, user interface, functionality, control mechanisms, etc.
Use sections to organize your prompts.
Consider performance, accessibility, error handling, and responsiveness.
Request documentation and examples from the AI.
Store your prompts in your repository for future use and iteration.
Conclusion
AI-assisted development, when used effectively, can significantly boost productivity. By mastering the art of prompt crafting and understanding the new workflow, developers can harness the power of AI to create more efficient, robust, and user-friendly solutions.

Content Optimization: Craft concise and informative content that is tailored to the context of EDS delivery. Employ plain language and avoid jargon whenever possible. Incorporate multimedia elements strategically to enhance engagement and understanding.
Metadata Utilization: Leverage metadata effectively to improve content discoverability and searchability. Assign relevant keywords, descriptions, and tags to facilitate efficient information retrieval.
Platform-Specific Requirements: Adhere to any guidelines or specifications dictated by the EDS platform. This may include restrictions on file formats, image sizes, or other technical considerations.
Accessibility: Ensure that content is accessible to users of all abilities. Follow accessibility guidelines and provide alternative formats when necessary.
Version Control: Maintain version control of documents to track changes and facilitate collaboration among team members.
Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test and validate content prior to publication to ensure accuracy and functionality within the EDS environment.
User Feedback: Actively seek and incorporate user feedback to continuously improve the quality and relevance of EDS content.
By following these best practices, developers can create high-quality, user-centric content that maximizes the potential of the EDS platform.
Configuration and Structure
Configuration Constants Pattern
When developing blocks for EDS, it's recommended to use configuration constants at the top of your JavaScript files. This pattern improves code readability, maintainability, and prevents "magic numbers" or strings from being scattered throughout your code:
Using this pattern makes it easier for other developers to find and modify configuration values without digging through implementation details. It also centralizes configuration, making it clear what aspects of the component are customizable.
Standard File Organization
EDS projects follow a consistent file organization pattern. Each block or component has its own directory with standardized files:
This structure ensures that all blocks have complete documentation, clear examples for authors, and consistent organization that makes it easy for developers to understand how the block works.
JavaScript Patterns
ESLint Integration
EDS follows the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, which discourages console output in production code. When you need to use console logging for debugging, use the following pattern:
This approach prevents ESLint errors while maintaining the ability to use console logging for debugging. Remember to:
Keep the comment on the line immediately before the console statement
Be specific about which rule you're disabling
Remove or comment out debug logging before committing to production
Asynchronous Data Fetching
When fetching data from APIs or the EDS query index, follow this pattern for clean, error-handled asynchronous requests:
This pattern includes:
Clear loading states to improve user experience
Proper error handling with try/catch blocks
Response validation with specific error messages
User-friendly error states when things go wrong
Clean DOM manipulation to update the UI
Standard Data Structure
When integrating with external data sources or the EDS query-index.json, follow this consistent pattern for JSON data structures:
This structure works well with EDS's built-in query functionality and makes it easier to create consistent data handling patterns across your site.
Event Handling
For event handling, use this pattern to maintain clean separation and avoid memory leaks:
Key benefits of this pattern:
Handler functions are defined separately for better readability
Event listeners are clearly attached in one section
Optional cleanup function helps prevent memory leaks in single-page applications
CSS Best Practices
CSS Variables for Theming
Define configuration through CSS variables to create consistent, flexible theming:
This comprehensive approach to CSS variables provides several benefits:
Consistent visual design across the site
Easy updates to the design system by changing variable values
Better organization of design tokens
Simplified maintenance and theme switching
Standard Breakpoints
EDS follows a common set of breakpoints for responsive design:
Key principles for responsive design in EDS:
Always use min-width queries for consistency
Design mobile-first, adding complexity for larger screens
Use standard breakpoints (600px, 900px, 1200px) for consistency
Test all components at each breakpoint
Block Variation Pattern
For blocks that support variations, follow this pattern:
This approach allows authors to specify variations in the document (e.g., Blockname (dark, centered)) without requiring additional JavaScript logic. Content authors can easily mix and match variations to achieve their desired appearance.
Documentation Standards
Block Documentation Template
When documenting a block, include the following sections in your README.md:
This comprehensive documentation structure ensures that both developers and content authors can effectively use your blocks. Always include:
Clear examples that content authors can copy and paste
Visual examples of variations when possible
Accessibility information to ensure inclusive design
Performance considerations to maintain site speed
Code Comments
For complex JavaScript functions, use JSDoc-style comments:
For CSS, include section comments to organize your stylesheet:
Resource Loading Patterns
CSS Loading
Lazy JavaScript Loading
Delayed Functionality
Common Implementation Patterns
Analytics Implementation
A clean pattern for implementing analytics without modifying core files:
Cookie Consent Block
A reusable block for implementing cookie consent:
Personalization Block
A reusable block for implementing simple personalization:

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 11
Getting AI to document your output.
Review its Code, using Cursor.
Review its Code, using EDS prompt
Review its Code, as a Senior Dev
Meta-Introspection
A Senior developer just joined my team, Claude
It's amazing what you can do with AI, properly trained, with context, operating procedures and prompts.
In my previous post I showed you Cursor/Claude creating and amending a carousel.
Not too smart you might say. Next step is to get Claude to review its code, both a self -review and as a senior developer. Now as a senior developer I also want Claude to give learning points to the team. This is called meta-introspection.In this post, I'll walk you through how I use Cursor and Claude AI together to create components for Adobe's Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. This powerful combination effectively brings a senior developer to your team, making work with Adobe's Edge Delivery Services a joy.
Watch the youtube, then read the outputs below, this block is called a ‘showcaser’ and its contents are the prompts and sources
Code
# Introduction
# Introduction
# Showcaser Block Prompt
Showcaser.js
showcaser.css
# Showcaser README.md
## Language Detection
# Showcaser Block Self-Review
# Senior Developer Code Review: Showcaser Block
Setting Up Cursor
Cursor (https://www.trycursor.com/) is a clone of Microsoft Visual Studio Code, enhanced with AI capabilities. Here's how to configure it:
Create an account: Cursor requires a $20/month subscription, similar to Claude AI.
Configure Cursor settings:
Enable AI features in the Cursor Settings panel.
Set up simple rules that will always be sent to the AI (e.g., using async/await in Node.js, following Airbnb style guide).
Include a .cursorrules file for project-specific standard operating procedures.
Choose your preferred AI model (I use Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
Enable features like Cursor Tab, Partial Accepts, Cursor Predictions, and Composer.
Add relevant documentation (I use "EDS notes" for Edge Delivery Services).
Enable notepads for sharing instruction fragments across projects.
Enable AI features in the Cursor Settings panel.

Enable features like Cursor Tab, Partial Accepts, Cursor Predictions, and Composer.
Add relevant documentation (I use "EDS notes" for Edge Delivery Services).
Enable notepads for sharing instruction fragments across projects.
Working with AI in Cursor
Cursor provides three main ways to interact with AI:
Chat: Ask questions about your codebase or get explanations of specific files.
Command: Use custom commands to trigger specific AI actions (e.g., review, senior developer perspective).
Composer: Create new files and components from scratch using AI prompts.
Creating a Component: The Showcaser Block
I'll demonstrate the process of creating a "Showcaser" block for displaying code snippets:
The cmd-xxxxx.md files are just prompts, telling claude how to behave
Write an AI prompt: Create a markdown file with detailed instructions for the AI.
Generate initial files: Use the Composer to create JavaScript, CSS, README, and demo files.
Review and refine: I used the cmd-review.md to have the AI fix common mistakes and improve the code.
Iterate and debug: Continuously provide feedback and ask for specific changes (e.g., adding a collapse function).
Get a senior perspective: Use cmd-senior.md to get a code review and learning pointers from a senior developer perspective.
Refine the prompt: Use cmd-engineer.md to have the AI suggest improvements to your initial prompt based on the final result.
The Final Result
After about two hours of iterating with the AI, I created a Showcaser component with the following features:
Collapsible left panel for code display
Syntax highlighting for different file types (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)
"Copy to clipboard" functionality
Expandable code blocks for long snippets
"Back to top" and "Return to menu" navigation
Detailed introduction explaining component usage
Conclusion
Using Cursor and Claude AI together with Adobe's Edge Delivery Services allowed me to create a complex component without writing a single line of code manually. This approach significantly speeds up development and brings senior-level expertise to your projects.
By leveraging AI in this way, you can focus on design and functionality while the AI handles the implementation details. It's a powerful workflow that can dramatically improve your productivity and code quality.
The journey into AI-powered development is just beginning, and the possibilities are limitless. Are you ready to be part of this exciting future?

22 February: Rethinking AI’s Role in Content Management with Tom Cranstoun Boye & Co CMS Experts Member’s Call
It's been a month since the Boye & Co CMS Kickoff 24 Program conference. CMS Kickoff 24 raised vital questions surrounding AI's role in content management. Considering translation, bias, regulation challenges and lack of trust currently associated with AI, reviewers and editors are required to monitor and edit AI-produced content.
In this call, Tom shares how AI simplicity affects your business, the need for better content modelling, and the key responsibilities of an emerging team role: The AI Evangelist. He suggests that AI is currently best suited for consuming content rather than producing it, and proposes that the current state of AI content creation is best described as a beta experiment.

What's Missing from AI - A Pragmatic Look at Enterprise AI Limitations
Despite remarkable progress in artificial intelligence, today's AI systems—particularly Large Language Models—lack several critical capabilities that limit their effectiveness in enterprise settings.
Understanding what AI can and cannot do is critical for business success. Without this knowledge, organizations risk wasting millions on solutions that cannot deliver promised results, making strategic decisions based on hallucinated data, creating reputational damage from AI systems that produce biased or harmful outputs, and missing opportunities to implement genuinely valuable AI solutions that work within known constraints.
The "AI" Misnomer
The term "AI" itself is misleadingly broad, suggesting human-like intelligence when it merely refers to technologies like Large Language Models that predict word sequences without true comprehension. Companies use "AI" as a marketing buzzword, even when machine learning is minimally involved, creating inflated expectations that exacerbate implementation challenges.
The Fundamental Flaws in AI
AI's capabilities consistently fall short of the hype surrounding them. Organizations often invest based on theoretical possibilities rather than practical implementations, creating exposure to disappointment and wasted resources. Understanding these limitations is crucial for developing effective AI implementations that truly meet organizational needs.
The Hallucination Problem
AI systems don't simply admit ignorance when faced with knowledge gaps—they invent facts, statistics, citations, and entire scenarios with absolute confidence. This isn't an occasional glitch; it's baked into their fundamental design. They're built to provide answers, not acknowledge limitations.
In specialized domains like law, medicine, or finance, this flaw becomes potentially catastrophic, with systems recommending treatments based on fabricated research or citing nonexistent legal precedents.
Cultural Alignment Biases
Most mainstream AI systems are aligned primarily with Western, English-speaking, corporate perspectives—often reflecting Silicon Valley worldviews rather than diverse global cultures. This hidden bias means they consistently favor certain cultural frameworks, ethical systems, and knowledge bases while marginalizing others.
Alternative models from different regions demonstrate their own cultural alignments. Organizations outside the dominant cultures of AI development risk finding themselves using systems that fundamentally misunderstand their values, priorities, and ways of knowing.
Toxic Training Data
Most large language models are trained on massive datasets scraped from the public internet—a veritable cesspool of misinformation, extremism, conspiracy theories, and every form of human bias imaginable. Even when developers attempt to filter this data, the sheer volume makes comprehensive curation effectively impossible.
The resulting systems inevitably mirror these problematic elements, presenting fringe viewpoints as mainstream or outdated information as current fact. Model updates are released unpredictably, driven by competition rather than structured release cycles.
The Memory Problem
AI systems lack persistent memory across interactions. Each conversation starts fresh with minimal retention of previous exchanges beyond what's explicitly included in the prompt. This creates a perpetual "Groundhog Day" effect where systems can contradict themselves across sessions without any awareness of inconsistency.
For organizations seeking to build institutional knowledge through AI, this fundamental limitation presents a significant obstacle to developing the kind of relationship-building that characterizes effective human interactions.
Knowledge Cutoff Limitations
AI systems have binary knowledge boundaries, with understanding stopping at a specific cutoff date. Unlike human professionals who continuously update their knowledge, these systems will confidently respond based on whatever version of reality existed in their training data, regardless of how the world has changed since.
This creates a particularly problematic situation for rapidly evolving fields or any context where current information is essential. For organizations in dynamic industries, these outdated "facts" presented with complete confidence can lead to dangerously misguided decisions.
Understanding Modern Web Architecture
Modern headless architecture separates content from presentation, making it difficult for AI to understand context. AI systems struggle with SPAs and JS-rendered content, creating significant limitations for AI-based analysis.
This architectural mismatch means AI systems often have a fundamentally flawed understanding of modern web content, leading to incorrect interpretations and problematic responses.
Structured Data Solutions
To improve how AI systems interact with content, organizations should implement:
JSON-LD: Creates explicit relationships between data elements using established schemas, making content machine-readable while maintaining human presentation
llms.txt Standard: Functions like robots.txt but for AI systems, providing critical context about website purpose, structure, and appropriate use
AI-Friendly Information Architecture: Combining these approaches creates dual-channel content that serves both human visitors and AI systems, ensuring consistent information delivery
Regulatory Considerations
Organizations must navigate multiple overlapping regulatory frameworks:
Data Privacy: GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California, and global equivalents impose strict requirements on AI data processing
Sector-Specific: Financial services (SR 11-7), healthcare (HIPAA), and legal/professional services face additional compliance hurdles
Emerging AI Regulations: The EU AI Act, Colorado AI Act, and similar legislation create new requirements for AI applications
These frameworks emphasize transparency, human oversight, and explainability—principles often at odds with generic cloud AI services.
The Rise of Agentic AI
AI is rapidly evolving from passive tools to active agents with increasingly autonomous capabilities:
Agentic Systems: Modern AI increasingly operates as an independent actor, making sequences of decisions with minimal human oversight
Model-Context-protocol (MCP): AI systems now generate and execute their own code, expanding capabilities but also creating unpredictable behaviors
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Architectures: Multiple AI agents now collaborate without human mediation, forming complex emergent behaviors
Critical Business Risk: These developments create a rapidly growing need for robust, reliable systems under organizational control
As AI evolves from passive tool to active partner, businesses that lack control over their AI infrastructure face exponentially increasing risk.
Local Deployment of Foundation Models
Public cloud-based LLMs leave businesses with no control over model behavior, content filtering, or update schedules. When providers change their models, your applications can break without warning. Local deployment provides several critical advantages:
Complete Control: Organizations select specific models and manage versions according to their schedules
Data Sovereignty: Train with proprietary data without third-party exposure
Reduced Dependencies: Eliminate reliance on external providers whose terms, pricing, and capabilities may change unexpectedly
Fixed vs. Variable Pricing: Convert token-based costs into predictable capital investments
Enhanced Compliance: Implement governance frameworks tailored to specific regulatory contexts
This approach requires greater technical expertise and infrastructure investment but provides unmatched control.
Foundation Models as Better Building Blocks
Business-focused foundation models employ transformer architectures similar to consumer models but with critical differences:
Higher-Quality Data: Trained on business-relevant datasets rather than the entire internet
Customization Potential: Can be further trained with organization-specific information
Reduced Hallucinations: Domain-specific training grounds the model in factual information
Value Alignment: Can be specifically trained to embody organizational ethical frameworks and priorities
This layered approach creates AI that truly understands organizational terminology, processes, and values.
The AI Content Architect
The AI Content Architect serves as a bridge between technological capabilities and business requirements:
Guardrails and Guidelines: Establishes frameworks ensuring AI alignment with organizational values
Data Preparation: Evaluates existing information and develops training pipelines
Value Translation: Converts company principles into training data and metrics
Governance and Ethics: Creates frameworks aligning AI systems with company standards
This role combines technical expertise with domain knowledge to ensure AI truly serves organizational needs.
Realistic Assessment
Implementing AI requires substantial investment:
Hardware: $3,000-$15,000 per knowledge worker for inference; $60,000+ for training machines
Expertise: Specialized AI knowledge remains both essential and expensive
Data Preparation: Most organizational data requires significant work before AI training
Ongoing Maintenance: Models need regular monitoring, updating, and retraining
These costs create particular challenges for smaller organizations with limited resources.
Pragmatic Pathways
Organizations require approaches matching their specific circumstances:
Large Organizations: Consider local deployment with dedicated AI Content Architects
Medium Organizations: Explore hybrid approaches combining local models with carefully selected cloud services
Small Organizations: Focus on thoughtfully selected cloud services with appropriate oversight
All Organizations: Develop clear guidelines for appropriate AI use and focus on applications that align with specific business needs
Conclusion
The future of organizational AI lies in thoughtfully integrating these technologies to enhance human capabilities rather than replace them. By acknowledging current limitations while working to overcome them, organizations can build AI implementations that genuinely advance their missions.
This requires realistic expectations, appropriate investment, and continuous alignment between AI capabilities and business requirements. The most successful implementations will be those that recognize AI not as magic but as a powerful tool with specific strengths and limitations.

Why Modern Web Architecture Confuses AI
One significant but often overlooked limitation of current AI systems is their struggle to comprehend modern web architectures, particularly headless implementations that separate content from presentation. This technical mismatch creates fundamental challenges for AI-website interaction that must be addressed for effective implementation.
The Architectural Mismatch
Modern web development has increasingly embraced headless architectures that decouple backend content management from frontend presentation:
Content Management Systems (CMS) store structured content without presentation information
JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular dynamically render content
Single Page Applications (SPAs) load content asynchronously based on user interaction
APIs serve raw content that gets transformed by client-side code
These architectures deliver significant benefits for human users—better performance, more interactive experiences, and greater development flexibility. However, they create fundamental comprehension challenges for AI systems that weren't designed to process dynamically rendered content.
Why AI Struggles with Headless Content
AI systems like Large Language Models face several specific challenges when interacting with headless implementations:
JavaScript Execution Limitations
Most AI systems can't execute JavaScript to render dynamic content
Content loaded asynchronously after initial page load remains invisible
Interactive elements that reveal content based on user actions are inaccessible
Most AI systems can't execute JavaScript to render dynamic content
Content loaded asynchronously after initial page load remains invisible
Interactive elements that reveal content based on user actions are inaccessible
Context Separation
Content structure is divorced from visual presentation cues
Spatial relationships that help humans understand content hierarchy are lost
Visual design elements that convey importance of relationships disappear
Content structure is divorced from visual presentation cues
Spatial relationships that help humans understand content hierarchy are lost
Visual design elements that convey importance of relationships disappear
Missing Metadata
Presentation metadata that provides context cues gets stripped away
Relationships between content elements become ambiguous
Implicit information conveyed through design becomes inaccessible
Presentation metadata that provides context cues gets stripped away
Relationships between content elements become ambiguous
Implicit information conveyed through design becomes inaccessible
For AI systems, accessing a headless website without these additional layers is like asking a human to understand a document by reading only the raw data without any formatting, headlines, or visual organization.
Real-World Consequences
This architectural mismatch leads to several practical problems for organizations:
Inconsistent AI Interactions: The same content produces different responses when accessed through different channels
Missing Information: Critical content may be invisible to AI systems if loaded dynamically
Context Misunderstanding: AI systems may fundamentally misinterpret content relationships and importance
Unhelpful Responses: When asked about dynamic sites, AI may provide responses based on incomplete information
These issues affect not just public AI systems but also locally deployed foundation models, potentially undermining the effectiveness of organizational AI implementations that rely on internally developed web resources.
Bridging the Gap
Organizations can address these challenges through several approaches:
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG)
Pre-render JavaScript content on the server for AI accessibility
Generate static versions of dynamic content for AI consumption
Implement hybrid rendering approaches that serve different versions to different clients

AI-Specific Content APIs
Develop separate API endpoints specifically for AI consumption
Structure these endpoints to include contextual information
Include relationship metadata typically conveyed through presentation

Structure these endpoints to include contextual information
Include relationship metadata typically conveyed through presentation
These approaches create "dual-channel content" that serves both human users through rich interactive experiences and AI systems through structured, accessible formats that don't require JavaScript execution or visual interpretation.
Future-Proofing Considerations
As organizations plan their web architecture, they should consider:
Content-First Design: Structuring information independent of presentation while maintaining clear relationships
Progressive Enhancement: Building baseline experiences that work without JavaScript, then enhancing for capable clients
Semantic Structure: Using proper HTML semantics that convey meaning even without visual presentation
Metadata Enrichment: Adding explicit relationship information that replaces visual context cues
While AI systems may eventually develop better capabilities for processing dynamic content, organizations implementing AI today must address this fundamental mismatch between modern web architecture and AI processing capabilities.# What's Missing from AI: Critical Gaps and Enterprise Solutions
The "AI" Misnomer - Setting Realistic Expectations
The term "AI" itself creates unrealistic expectations, suggesting human-like intelligence when most systems are simply pattern-matching algorithms without true comprehension. This fundamental misunderstanding leads to inflated expectations and implementation disappointments.
Beyond the Buzzword
The AI label has become a marketing tool, applied liberally to technologies with minimal machine learning components. This terminological sleight-of-hand evokes science fiction imagery—sentient machines and artificial general intelligence—creating a significant gap between perception and reality.
"Organizations investing in 'AI' often discover they've purchased sophisticated pattern-matching rather than the intelligent systems they envisioned."
This misalignment between expectations and capabilities forms the foundation for many implementation challenges. Before addressing specific technical limitations, organizations must reset their fundamental understanding of what these systems can and cannot do.
Understanding the Problem Space
1. The Hallucination Problem - Confident Fiction
Perhaps the most alarming issue with modern AI systems is their propensity to hallucinate—to generate information that appears factual but is entirely fabricated. These aren't occasional glitches; they're baked into the fundamental design.
Why Hallucinations Occur
AI systems don't simply admit ignorance when faced with knowledge gaps; they invent facts, statistics, citations, and entire scenarios with absolute confidence. They're built to provide answers, not acknowledge limitations, making it nearly impossible for users to distinguish between accurate information and complete fiction.
Domain-Specific Risks
In specialized domains, this flaw becomes potentially catastrophic:
Legal: AI might confidently cite nonexistent case law or misinterpret existing precedents
Medical: Systems could recommend treatments based on fabricated research
Financial: AI might generate sophisticated-sounding but fundamentally flawed analysis
The pattern-matching may seem impressive, but it lacks the critical judgment that comes from actual understanding. This limitation alone poses significant risks for organizations relying on AI for critical functions.
2. Toxic Training Data - The Internet-Scale Problem
Most large language models are trained on massive datasets scraped from the public internet—a veritable cesspool of misinformation, extremism, conspiracy theories, and every form of human bias imaginable.
The Curation Challenge
Even when developers attempt to filter this data, the sheer volume makes comprehensive curation effectively impossible. The models have ingested fiction, propaganda, outdated information, and outright falsehoods, all without reliable mechanisms to distinguish fact from fantasy.
Unpredictable Updates
This training problem is compounded by unpredictable release cycles. Organizations build workflows around specific model behaviors, only to have those behaviors change with the next update. Unlike software with clear versioning and change management, AI models may shift in subtle ways that undermine established processes.
3. The Memory Problem - Perpetual Groundhog Day
Current AI systems lack persistent memory across interactions. Each conversation essentially starts fresh, with no meaningful retention of previous exchanges beyond what's explicitly included in the prompt.
Organizational Impact
Beyond mere inconvenience, this limitation means the AI can contradict itself across sessions without any awareness of the inconsistency. It will confidently assert one "fact" today and its opposite tomorrow, with equal conviction in both cases.
Relationship Discontinuity
The memory problem prevents the kind of relationship-building that characterizes effective human interactions. The system doesn't remember previous corrections, preferences, or contexts unless they're explicitly reintroduced in each session, creating a perpetual "Groundhog Day" effect that undermines efficiency and trust.
4. Knowledge Cutoff Limitation - Binary Understanding
Unlike human professionals who continuously update their knowledge, AI systems have binary knowledge boundaries. Their understanding of the world effectively stops at a specific cutoff date, after which they have no reliable information.
Equal Confidence, Unequal Accuracy
Rather than acknowledging when information might be outdated, these systems will confidently respond based on whatever version of reality existed in their training data, regardless of how the world has changed since. This creates a particularly problematic situation for rapidly evolving fields or any context where current information is essential.
Domain-Specific Obsolescence
For organizations operating in dynamic industries, this limitation means AI outputs may be dangerously obsolete, reflecting regulatory frameworks, competitive landscapes, or technical capabilities that no longer exist. The confidence with which these outdated "facts" are presented makes this limitation particularly treacherous.
5. Cultural Alignment Biase - Silicon Valley Is Not the World
Most mainstream AI systems are aligned primarily with Western, English-speaking, corporate perspectives—often reflecting Silicon Valley worldviews rather than diverse global cultures.
Hidden Value Frameworks
This hidden bias means they consistently favor certain cultural frameworks, ethical systems, and knowledge bases while marginalizing others. Organizations outside the dominant cultures of AI development risk finding themselves using systems that fundamentally misunderstand their values, priorities, and ways of knowing.
Alternative Alignments
These biases aren't limited to Western AI systems. Alternative models from different regions demonstrate their own cultural alignments, each reflecting the cultural and political contexts of their development. Organizations must carefully consider whether these built-in cultural assumptions align with their own values and objectives.
The Regulatory Landscape -Compliance Considerations
The regulatory environment for AI implementation is evolving rapidly, adding another layer of complexity to organizational decision-making.
Data Privacy Frameworks
Organizations must navigate multiple overlapping privacy regulations:
Regulation
Region
Key Requirements
GDPR
Europe
Explicit consent, right to explanation, data minimization
CCPA/CPRA
California
Opt-out rights, data disclosure requirements
PIPL
China
Data localization, separate consent for cross-border transfers
These frameworks impose strict requirements on how organizations process personal information, with penalties for non-compliance often calculated as percentages of global revenue.
Sector-Specific Regulations
Beyond general data protection requirements, many industries face additional regulatory frameworks:
Financial services: Model explainability requirements under SR 11-7
Healthcare: Protected health information safeguards under HIPAA
Legal services: Professional responsibility frameworks emphasizing human oversight
Emerging AI-Specific Regulations
New regulatory frameworks specifically targeting AI applications are emerging globally:
The EU AI Act establishes tiered requirements based on risk categories
The Colorado AI Act creates compliance requirements for certain AI applications
Industry-specific AI guidelines from regulatory bodies create new requirements for regulated domains
These emerging regulations emphasize transparency, explainability, and human oversight—principles that can be difficult to satisfy with generic cloud AI services.
Solution Pathways: Addressing the Gaps
Structured Data Approaches: Enhancing AI-Content Interaction
For organizations seeking to improve how AI systems interact with their content, structured data approaches provide a crucial bridge between human and machine perception.
Creating Machine-Readable Context
JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) deserves particular attention as a standardized method for providing semantic context to web content. This approach creates explicit relationships between data elements using established schemas, helping AI systems reliably parse information without executing JavaScript or interpreting visual layouts.
Example implementation:
The Emerging llms.txt Standard
The llms.txt standard provides a structured communication channel between your website and AI systems, similar to how robots.txt guides search engines but with significantly expanded capabilities. Located at your site's root (e.g., https://example.com/llms.txt), it uses Markdown formatting to provide AI systems with essential context for appropriate interaction.
A comprehensive llms.txt file includes:
Core Elements:
Title and Site Identity: Clear identification of your website/organization
Summary Description: Concise explanation of site purpose and content focus
Access Controls: Request limits, cooldown periods, and authentication requirements
Content Restrictions: Private sections, sensitive areas requiring special handling
Attribution Requirements: Specific citation formats and attribution guidelines
Usage Permissions: Clear boundaries for how content may be used by AI systems
Example Implementation:
The standard also supports advanced features:
Site Type Declaration: Explicit identification of website purpose and technology stack
Error Handling Instructions: How AI should respond to unavailable content
Human Section: Special guidance for human visitors viewing the file
Version Control: Documentation of changes and policy evolution
Building AI-Friendly Information Architecture
By implementing both JSON-LD and llms.txt standards, organizations create dual-channel content that serves both human visitors and AI systems, ensuring consistent information delivery regardless of access method.
Local Deployment of Foundation Models
For larger organizations facing the challenges outlined above, locally deployed foundation models offer a compelling alternative to generic cloud AI services.
Complete Control
Local deployment provides full control over:
Model selection based on organizational needs
Version management according to internal schedules
Training approaches and parameters
Response characteristics and limitations
Rather than adapting to whatever a cloud provider decides, organizations can maintain stable model versions for extended periods, avoiding disruption from unexpected updates.
Data Sovereignty
Perhaps the most significant advantage is data sovereignty—the ability to train models with proprietary data without exposing that information to third parties. This creates opportunities for organization-specific AI that reflects internal knowledge, terminology, and contexts.
For organizations with valuable intellectual property or sensitive information, this data sovereignty is often the difference between useful AI implementation and unacceptable risk.
Economic Considerations
Local deployment converts variable expenses into fixed capital investments:
Deployment Type
Initial Investment
Ongoing Costs
Scaling Economics
Cloud Services
Low
High (usage-based)
Linear cost scaling
Local Deployment
High
Low (maintenance)
Diminishing marginal cost
While the initial investment is higher, organizations with substantial AI usage often find the total cost of ownership significantly lower with local deployment, particularly as usage scales across the enterprise.
Foundation Models as Better Building Blocks
A crucial element in the transition to locally deployed AI is the emergence of foundation models specifically designed for business adaptation.
Higher-Quality Training Data
Business-focused foundation models employ similar architectures to consumer models but with critical differences in their training data. Rather than ingesting the entire internet with all its problematic content, these models focus on business-relevant datasets—legal texts, financial reports, academic publications, and other high-quality information sources.
This initial training provides a more solid foundation, with better factual accuracy in professional domains and fewer tendencies to reproduce problematic content.
Customization Process
The typical customization process involves several stages:
Selection: Choose a foundation model appropriate for your domain
Deployment: Install in your on-premise or private cloud environment
Data preparation: Curate organizational knowledge for training
Fine-tuning: Train the model on your specific data
Validation: Test against domain-specific scenarios
Deployment: Integrate into organizational workflows
Monitoring: Continuously evaluate performance and behavior
This process creates AI systems that genuinely understand your organization's terminology, processes, and contexts rather than applying generic knowledge to specific problems.
The AI Content Architect
Successfully implementing enterprise AI systems—particularly when using foundation models—requires a new organizational role that bridges technical capabilities and business requirements. The AI Content Architect combines data architecture expertise, domain knowledge, and ethical frameworks to ensure AI systems genuinely serve organizational needs rather than simply showcasing technological possibilities.
Core Responsibilities
1. Data Architecture and Preparation
The AI Content Architect evaluates and structures organizational information for AI consumption, preparing it for effective training and interaction:
Content Inventory: Cataloging existing information assets across the organization
Format Standardization: Converting diverse content into AI-compatible formats
Quality Assessment: Evaluating information for accuracy, currency, and completeness
Chunking Strategy: Developing optimal approaches for breaking content into trainable units
Metadata Enhancement: Adding context markers that improve AI understanding
This data preparation phase creates the foundation for all subsequent AI capabilities, ensuring systems are trained on high-quality organizational information rather than generic internet data.
2. Guardrails and Guidelines Development
The AI Content Architect establishes frameworks that ensure AI systems continuously align with organizational values and objectives:
Response Boundaries: Defining appropriate content areas and response types
Alignment Examples: Creating training examples demonstrating proper alignment
Domain-Specific Guidance: Developing specialized rules for particular information domains
Edge Case Handling: Establishing protocols for ambiguous or problematic scenarios
Update Procedures: Creating processes for maintaining alignment as needs evolve
These guardrails prevent corporate AI from generating content that conflicts with organizational values or regulatory requirements, even when technically answering a user's question.
3. Value Translation
Perhaps the most unique aspect of the AI Content Architect role is translating organizational values into concrete training data and evaluation metrics:
Value Identification: Working with leadership to articulate core organizational principles
Example Creation: Developing diverse examples showing values in practice
Edge Case Exploration: Creating challenging scenarios that test value alignment
Evaluation Criteria: Establishing measurable standards for value adherence
Feedback Integration: Incorporating ongoing assessment into training processes
This translation process ensures AI systems reflect the organization's distinct perspective rather than generic responses based on internet-scale training data.
4. Governance and Ethics Implementation
The AI Content Architect creates and maintains frameworks for responsible AI use within the organization:
Usage Policies: Defining appropriate AI applications and boundaries
Risk Assessment: Identifying potential harms and mitigation strategies
Monitoring Systems: Establishing ongoing evaluation of AI outputs
Feedback Channels: Creating mechanisms for reporting concerns
Improvement Processes: Developing procedures for addressing identified issues
These governance frameworks align AI systems with organizational standards, regulatory requirements, and ethical principles, ensuring responsible use that benefits both the organization and broader society.
Required Skills and Background
Effective AI Content Architects combine several competency areas:
Technical Expertise
Data architecture and management
Language model training techniques

Ethical Foundation
Value alignment principles
Bias identification and mitigation
Regulatory compliance
Risk assessment
Governance frameworks
This multifaceted skill set allows AI Content Architects to serve as bridges between technical possibilities and business requirements, ensuring AI implementations deliver genuine organizational value rather than simply deploying technology for its own sake.
Organizational Positioning
For maximum effectiveness, AI Content Architects should be positioned as peers to both technical and business leadership:
Reporting structure that enables cross-functional influence
Direct access to senior leadership for value alignment
Collaborative relationship with technical implementation teams
Advisory capacity to business units implementing AI solutions
Authority to establish and enforce AI governance standards
This positioning ensures AI Content Architects can effectively represent organizational values and requirements throughout the implementation process, from initial planning through ongoing operation and improvement.
Development Pathway
Organizations can develop AI Content Architects through several routes:
Upskilling existing content strategy professionals with AI technical training
Providing domain and ethics training to technical AI specialists
Creating cross-functional teams that collectively fulfill the role requirements
Establishing formal development programs for this emerging specialty
Recruiting externally for individuals with demonstrated cross-disciplinary expertise
As this role continues to evolve, organizations that invest in developing this capability will gain significant advantages in implementing AI systems that genuinely reflect their values and serve their specific needs.
Realistic Assessment - What It Really Takes
While local deployment offers compelling advantages, organizations must realistically assess the investments required for successful implementation.
Hardware Investments
Local deployment requires significant hardware resources:
Usage Type
Hardware Requirements
Approximate Cost
Knowledge Worker (Inference)
NVIDIA RTX 4090 or equivalent
$3,000-$15,000 per user
Training Environment
Multiple A100/H100 GPUs, high-speed storage
$60,000+ per machine
These costs could escalate as models become more complex, potentially requiring hardware upgrades to maintain performance as capabilities expand.
Expertise Requirements
Beyond hardware, organizations need specialized expertise:
AI engineers for model deployment and maintenance
Data scientists for training and optimization
Domain experts for content evaluation and governance
Integration specialists for workflow incorporation
This talent remains both scarce and expensive, creating particular challenges for smaller organizations without existing data science capabilities.
Data Preparation Realities
Most organizations discover their data isn't ready for AI training. Common issues include:
Inconsistent formatting across documents
Missing metadata and contextual information
Outdated or contradictory information
Accessibility barriers (PDFs, images, proprietary formats)
Significant investment in data architecture and preparation is often necessary before AI training can begin—an expense many organizations underestimate in their planning.
Ongoing Maintenance
Maintaining AI performance isn't a one-time effort but requires continuous:
Model monitoring and performance evaluation
Retraining with updated information
Bias detection and mitigation
Security vulnerability management
Compliance verification and documentation
These ongoing requirements demand dedicated resources and expertise that must be factored into total cost assessments.
Pragmatic Pathways
The optimal AI implementation strategy depends significantly on organizational size, resources, and specific needs. One-size-fits-all approaches inevitably fail to address the diverse requirements of different organizations.
Large Organization Strategy
Organizations with substantial resources and critical AI needs should consider:
Locally deployed foundation models with complete data sovereignty
Dedicated AI Content Architects for each major business domain
Comprehensive governance frameworks with centralized oversight
Custom-developed model architectures for specialized applications
This approach provides maximum control and alignment but requires significant investment in both infrastructure and expertise.
Medium Organization Approach
Organizations with moderate resources can benefit from hybrid approaches:
Locally deployed models for sensitive or core functions
Selective use of cloud services for non-critical applications
Part-time AI Content Architects focusing on highest-value domains
Simplified governance frameworks with risk-based oversight
This balanced approach provides enhanced control in critical areas while leveraging cloud economics for appropriate functions.
Small Organization Options
Organizations with limited resources should focus on:
Carefully selected cloud services with appropriate data protections
Clear usage guidelines emphasizing human verification of critical outputs
Vendor evaluation focusing on transparency and control options
Specific use cases with clearly defined value propositions
This approach acknowledges resource limitations while still capturing value from AI capabilities through careful application selection and management.
Universal Requirements
Regardless of size, all organizations implementing AI should:
Develop clear guidelines for appropriate AI use
Implement verification processes for critical outputs
Maintain human oversight of significant decisions
Document key processes for regulatory compliance
Regularly audit AI outputs for alignment with organizational values
These foundational elements ensure responsible AI deployment regardless of specific implementation approaches.
Building an AI-Ready Organization: Implementation Strategy
Developing an effective AI implementation strategy requires a thoughtful approach that acknowledges current limitations while still capturing genuine business value. The process begins with honest assessment of organizational needs and capabilities, then proceeds through implementation stages tailored to specific circumstances.
Assessment Phase
Before committing to specific implementation approaches, organizations should conduct a comprehensive assessment covering:
Data Inventory
What proprietary information would benefit from AI processing?
Where is this information currently stored and in what formats?
What are the sensitivity levels and compliance requirements?
How current and consistent is your information?

What timeline requirements shape implementation options?
This assessment phase provides the foundation for selecting an appropriate implementation approach based on organizational context rather than general AI hype.
Implementation Pathways
Based on the assessment, organizations should select an implementation pathway that aligns with their specific circumstances:
Pathway 1 Strategic Cloud Implementation
For organizations with limited technical resources or those seeking lower initial investment, carefully managed cloud implementation provides a viable entry point:
Select providers with transparent model information and alignment controls
Implement robust prompt engineering and output verification
Focus on non-critical applications initially
Establish clear guidelines for appropriate AI use
Develop data governance frameworks that apply even to cloud services
This pathway acknowledges resource limitations while still creating organizational guardrails that manage the inherent risks of cloud AI implementation.
Pathway 2 Hybrid Deployment
Organizations with moderate technical resources and higher data sensitivity requirements often benefit from a hybrid approach:
Utilize cloud services for general knowledge tasks
Implement retrieval-augmented generation with locally controlled data
Deploy domain-specific models for sensitive applications
Develop internal expertise in prompt engineering and evaluation
Create clear boundaries between cloud and local processing
This balanced approach leverages cloud economics where appropriate while maintaining control over sensitive information and critical applications.
Pathway 3 Local Foundation Models
Organizations with substantial technical resources and critical AI needs should consider comprehensive local deployment:
Select and deploy foundation models aligned with organizational requirements
Implement extensive fine-tuning with proprietary information
Develop robust evaluation frameworks for model outputs
Create tiered access controls based on user roles and needs
Establish continuous improvement processes for model performance
This approach provides maximum control and alignment but requires significant investment in both infrastructure and expertise.
Implementation Timeline
Regardless of the selected pathway, organizations should approach AI implementation as a phased journey rather than a single project:
Foundation Phase (Months 1-3)
Establish governance frameworks
Develop usage guidelines
Initial pilot projects
Technical infrastructure preparation

This phased approach allows organizations to build capabilities incrementally while maintaining appropriate controls and developing internal expertise.
The Future of Enterprise AI
The future of organizational AI lies not in perfect artificial general intelligence but in thoughtfully integrated systems that enhance human capabilities. By acknowledging current limitations while working to overcome them, organizations can build AI implementations that genuinely advance their missions.
This requires:
Realistic expectations based on actual capabilities
Appropriate investment matching organizational needs
Continuous alignment between AI functions and business requirements
Thoughtful governance ensuring responsible implementation
The organizations that succeed with AI won't be those chasing the latest hype or implementing technology for its own sake. Success will come to those who understand both the potential and the limitations of these systems, developing implementations that thoughtfully address specific organizational needs while managing the inherent risks.
As you consider your own AI implementation strategy, focus not on what these systems promise to be, but on what they actually are—powerful but limited tools that, when properly understood and carefully deployed, can significantly enhance human capabilities without attempting to replace them.

Building a Data Science Development PC
Building a high-performance data science development PC typically involves selecting professional-grade components. The system can be built around an NVIDIA professional GPU accelerator such as the RTX 6000 Ada with 48GB GDDR6 memory and 18,176 CUDA cores. This specialized graphics card includes substantial video memory (48GB) to process large datasets without memory swapping, and thousands of parallel processing units (CUDA cores) that can perform simultaneous calculations, making it significantly more efficient than CPUs for AI and machine learning workloads. This type of professional-grade GPU provides the processing power needed for AI model development and training.
At the core of the system an Intel Xeon-W processor, provides the necessary PCIe lanes for efficient GPU communication and robust multi-threading capabilities essential for data preparation tasks. The Xeon's workstation-grade architecture ensures stability during extended computation sessions and supports ECC memory for critical data integrity.
For storage, high-speed NVMe SSDs with read speeds exceeding 4TB/s can help reduce data bottlenecks and allow processing components to access information more quickly. These professional-grade storage solutions offer both speed and reliability benefits when working with large datasets and complex AI workloads.
A high-quality 80PLUS rated power supply is essential to deliver adequate power to all components. To effectively cool the system and maintain suitable temperatures during demanding tasks, a custom water cooling solution can be implemented. This method also produces less noise than traditional air cooling options. Additionally, water cooling can lead to more consistent performance and a potential increase in the lifespan of the hardware.
Recommended Operating System
For optimal performance, use a Linux distribution that includes a custom software stack built on NVIDIA CUDA-X, with NVIDIA-optimized libraries (e.g., RAPIDS, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe), as well as Docker-CE and NVIDIA-Docker2. These tools provide accelerated workflows for faster data preparation, model training, and data visualization—all critical components for efficient AI development. The Linux-based environment is specifically optimized for AI and machine learning workloads, offering better performance and compatibility with the most commonly used data science frameworks and libraries.
Investment Cost
A professional-grade data science development workstation represents a significant investment. With the specifications outlined above, you can expect approximate costs in the following ranges:
NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada GPU: €5,500 - €6,500
Intel Xeon-W processor: €1,800 - €3,700
High-capacity ECC memory: €900 - €1,800
Enterprise-grade NVMe SSDs: €450 - €1,400
Custom water cooling solution: €450 - €750
Professional-grade motherboard and power supply: €900 combined
The total investment for a complete system would likely fall in the range of €10,000 to €15,000. This price reflects the premium components specified without compromise, particularly the professional-grade NVIDIA GPU which represents a substantial portion of the overall cost.
Prices can vary based on exact specifications, regional availability, and whether you're purchasing from a system integrator who provides testing, optimization, and warranty support for the complete workstation.
Connectivity Options
For data science workstations, high-speed networking capabilities are essential for efficient data transfer. 10GbE (10 Gigabit Ethernet) connectivity provides significantly faster data movement between systems compared to standard 1GbE connections. Professional workstations can utilize motherboards with integrated 10GbE NICs that are compatible with standard RJ45 connectors, eliminating the need for special cabling in most office environments.
For environments requiring even greater throughput, one can implement SFP-based Intel X-series NICs or NVIDIA Networking ConnectX SmartNICs, which can achieve speeds up to 400Gb/s. These high-speed networking options reduce bottlenecks when transferring large datasets between storage systems, clusters, or cloud resources.
Display Requirements for Data Visualization
Data scientists benefit from multi-display configurations that provide ample screen real estate for simultaneous code editing, data visualization, and documentation viewing. The RTX 6000 Ada supports multiple high-resolution displays with professional color accuracy via DisplayPort connections.
For visualization-intensive work, consider 4K displays with high color accuracy (100% sRGB coverage) and IPS panel technology for consistent viewing angles. A dual or triple monitor setup allows for effective multitasking, with one primary display potentially featuring higher specifications (such as higher refresh rate or HDR support) for detailed visualization work. Some data scientists opt for a single ultrawide display as an alternative to multiple monitors.
Future-Proofing and Upgrade Paths
When building a professional data science workstation, several considerations can extend its useful lifespan:
PCIe Gen 5 Support: Selecting motherboards with PCIe Gen 5 compatibility ensures support for future GPU and storage technologies.
Modular Power Supplies: Higher-capacity modular power supplies provide headroom for additional components or more powerful future upgrades.
Expandable Memory: Motherboards with additional DIMM slots beyond initial needs allow for memory expansion as projects grow in complexity.
Secondary GPU Support: Ensuring the chassis, power supply, and motherboard can accommodate a second GPU creates an upgrade path for more intensive workloads.
Liquid Cooling Infrastructure: Investing in a custom loop water cooling system with expansion capacity makes adding cooling for future components straightforward.
Given the substantial investment in a professional data science workstation, planning these upgrade paths can significantly extend the system's useful lifetime, providing better long-term value despite the higher initial cost.
Closing Remarks
Concerned about the limitations of public AI systems—the hallucinations, toxic training data, and opaque processes that undermine trust? Building your own AI development infrastructure puts control back in your hands. With a dedicated system, you gain data sovereignty, eliminate usage-based pricing, and create AI capabilities genuinely aligned with your organizational values. No longer constrained by generic cloud services, your organization can develop AI that truly reflects your specific knowledge domains and strategic priorities.
Two distinct pathways exist for organizations ready to take this step. Knowledge workers who primarily run inference tasks can benefit from professional-grade workstations (€10,000-15,000) that deliver powerful local AI capabilities without privacy concerns. Data centers focused on model training require higher-performance systems (€60,000+) that accelerate innovation while maintaining complete data sovereignty. Whichever path matches your needs, our comprehensive guide provides everything required to build trustworthy, locally-deployed AI infrastructure.

The Stripped-Down Truth -- How AI Actually Works Without the Fancy Talk
The AI community has been hiding the real math behind clever, human-like terminology since the 1950s—all to make the topic seem more interesting and mysterious than it actually is. Let's cut through the jargon and explain what's really happening with these so-called "intelligent" systems, especially when it comes to mathematical reasoning.
AI Fails at Real Intelligence
The Brutal Hardware Reality
First, let's talk about what they don't mention in the glossy marketing: these systems require obscene amounts of computing power. We're talking about warehouse-sized data centers filled with specialized hardware (GPUs or TPUs) running at full blast for weeks or months straight. A single training run for a top-tier model consumes enough electricity to power a small town.
GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) are both specialized hardware designed to accelerate specific types of computations. GPUs were initially developed for rendering graphics in video games, but their architecture, which excels at parallel processing, also makes them well-suited for the matrix multiplication operations that underpin AI and machine learning. TPUs are custom-designed chips developed specifically for AI and machine learning workloads. They are optimized for tensor operations (hence the name) and are generally more efficient and powerful than GPUs for these tasks.
The financial cost is equally staggering. Training a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4 costs somewhere between $10-100 million—just for the computation. That doesn't include research salaries, infrastructure, or the ongoing costs of running the system for users. When a company releases a new AI model, they've literally burned millions of dollars in electricity bills to create it.
The Reality Behind AI "Intelligence"
A recent study on how these models handle International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) problems reveals the uncomfortable truth: they're terrible at actual mathematical reasoning. The study used 455 IMO shortlist problems from 2009 to 2023, covering algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and number theory. These problems were chosen for their originality, mathematical depth, and reliance on high-school-level mathematics—precisely the kind of problems that require genuine reasoning rather than pattern-matching.
Models from industry leaders like OpenAI, Google (Gemini), and DeepSeek were put to the test against these IMO-level problems—and the results are embarrassing:
Gemini 2.0 had a 0% correct solution rate
DeepSeek achieved only 3.8% correctness
OpenAI's models did no better
Even when these systems managed to stumble onto correct final answers, their reasoning was completely flawed. DeepSeek had a 63.2% final answer accuracy but 0% correctness in the solutions that led to those answers. They're guessing, not reasoning.
How These Models Actually Work
Data Hoarding: The First Step
First, they collect as much data as humanly possible. We're talking about:
Human text
Books (fiction and non-fiction)
Academic journals
Religious texts
Websites
Reddit posts
Email archives
Code repositories
Basically, if it contains text, they vacuum it up. This creates a massive database of human-generated content.
"Machine Learning" = Pattern Fitting with Statistics
What they call "Machine Learning" is actually just loading this data and fitting statistical patterns to the sets. They use well-established mathematical techniques like least-squares regression and error detection—nothing magical.
The system accumulates integers against floating point numbers and maps all varieties of the integers and their relationships into arrays. They then combine all these arrays, and each row in the combined work is known as a "vector." This is why you'll hear terms like "vector space" or "embedding space"—it's just multi-dimensional arrays of numbers.
Finding Patterns Through Brute Force
The machine then applies mathematical algorithms against each column of floating point numbers, looking for patterns, sometimes with many runs against the same data. Each time a pattern changes, a parameter is created to mark where the change occurred.
These parameters (also called "weights") are what the system adjusts during training. Modern systems (called "models") have billions of these parameters—not because they're doing anything intelligent, but because they're brute-forcing statistical relationships on a massive scale.
Training: Just More Pattern Adjustment
When the machine has extracted patterns from the data, it moves to the "training phase." Training simply means feeding the machine data it hasn't seen before along with the correct expected output.
The algorithms predict values based on the parameters they've established, then check if the answer matches the expected output. If the answer is wrong, the machine adjusts the parameters until the output is close enough to what's expected, sometimes adding new parameters. This is what they call "unsupervised training"—though it's supervised in the sense that the system knows what the right answer should be.
Batch Processing: Training in Bulk
These systems don't train on one example at a time—that would be painfully slow. Instead, they process "batches" of hundreds or thousands of examples simultaneously. This parallel processing is what makes training feasible, though it adds another layer of mathematical complexity as the system has to average the parameter updates across many examples at once.
The batch size is limited by how much memory the GPUs have. Bigger batches generally mean faster training, which is why companies keep buying more expensive hardware with more memory.
Training Never Really Ends
When a training cycle "ends," all the questions and answers are kept for the next upgrade of the AI and fed back in at the unsupervised learning stage. Fresh questions are generated for more human-reinforced learning, creating a continuous loop of improvement.
Six Common Fallacies in AI "Reasoning"
The math study identified six recurring types of errors that show these systems aren't actually reasoning:
Proof by Example: Drawing general conclusions based on specific cases without rigorous justification. Like proving a statement for a few values of (n) and claiming it holds for all (n).
Proposal Without Verification: Suggesting a strategy without proving its validity. Like claiming a winning strategy in a game without analyzing all possible counter-strategies.
Inventing Wrong Facts: Using non-existent or incorrect theorems. For example, citing a fabricated "Harmonic Square Root Theorem" to justify a claim.
Begging the Question (Circular Reasoning): Assuming the conclusion within the argument itself. Like assuming a number is irrational to "prove" its irrationality.
Solution by Trial-and-Error: Guessing solutions without providing reasoning for why they work.
Calculation Mistakes: Simple errors in arithmetic or algebra that invalidate the solution.
Sound familiar? These are mistakes no competent mathematician would make. Yet AI companies keep claiming their systems can "reason" and "think."
Interestingly, different types of math problems triggered different types of fallacies. Geometry problems required logical reasoning, leading to more fallacies involving fabricated facts or omitted steps. Algebra and number theory problems often involved functional equations or optimization, where models fell back on trial-and-error approaches without providing justification. This shows that these systems haven't truly mastered any area of mathematical reasoning—they just fail in different ways depending on the problem type.
Human-Reinforced Learning: Cheap Labor Fixes Mistakes
The machine enters a "human reinforced learning" phase where outputs are reviewed by humans (often working for low wages in developing countries) who speak enough English to verify if the answers are adequate. These workers approve, adjust, or reject the output, providing feedback to the machine, which then changes its parameters to move toward the desired answer. Nothing magical here—just humans cleaning up the system's mistakes.
This is why words like "delve" have become popular—they're not really used in mainstream English these days, though the rise of AI-produced articles has made it so. AI systems pick up these uncommon words from their training data (often from academic or literary texts) and overuse them in generated content, creating a distinct "AI writing style" that human editors now have to fix.
The Overfitting Problem
A dirty secret of these systems is that they often "memorize" parts of their training data instead of truly understanding patterns. This is called "overfitting." For example, if ChatGPT gives you a perfect explanation of the Franco-Prussian War, it's not because it "understands" history—it's because similar text existed in its training data and it's regurgitating the pattern.
Companies try to fix this by using techniques like "dropout" (randomly turning off parts of the network during training) and "early stopping" (quitting training before the model gets too good at memorizing). But overfitting remains a fundamental problem, especially as these models get larger and can memorize more of their training data.
Verification Failures
When tasked with checking whether a solution is correct, these models performed at or below random guessing:
DeepSeek identified 48% of correct solutions as correct but also misclassified 43% of incorrect solutions as correct
Gemini 2.0 performed similarly, with 52% accuracy for correct solutions and 50% for incorrect ones
They can't tell good math from bad math. Would you trust a "doctor" who couldn't tell healthy tissue from diseased tissue half the time?
Academic Cat-and-Mouse Games
Academics create questions designed to confound the systems, along with expected answers. These are then "learned" by adapting parameters to handle these edge cases. It's an endless game of researchers finding flaws, companies patching them, and researchers finding new flaws.
Hardware Evolution: The Real Driver of "Progress"
The improvements in AI over the past decade have less to do with algorithmic breakthroughs and more to do with hardware. NVIDIA, originally a gaming graphics card company, became one of the most valuable companies in the world because their GPUs happen to be good at the matrix multiplication that powers AI.
Each new generation of hardware allows companies to train bigger models on more data. Google created their own specialized chips called TPUs specifically optimized for AI workloads. The "intelligence" of these systems is directly proportional to how many expensive chips you can afford to throw at the problem.
Alignment = Censorship
What they call "alignment with human values" is simply where the AI is programmed with rules about what it shouldn't tell people—how not to make bombs, how not to write horror stories, how not to create sadistic material. It's censorship, plain and simple, implemented through pattern-matching and rejection of certain outputs.
Gaming the Benchmarks
There are standard tests that AI systems are expected to pass. The companies that create these machines ensure their AI will pass these tests by specifically running the questions and answers through the system after alignment and changing the parameters—another brute force win.
The study found that current benchmarks focusing on final answer correctness are completely insufficient for evaluating mathematical reasoning. When a company brags about their AI's performance on math tests, remember: they're often just measuring the ability to guess correctly, not to reason.
Quantization: Making Models Smaller
The full models are so large they're impractical to run on consumer computers. To make them usable, companies use a technique called "quantization"—essentially reducing the precision of the numbers in the model. Instead of storing weights as 32-bit floating point numbers, they might use 8-bit integers or even 4-bit numbers. This makes the models smaller and faster, with some loss in quality.
It's like taking a high-resolution image and saving it as a more compressed JPEG—you lose some detail, but it becomes more practical to store and share.
Inference Optimization: More Tricks to Make It Usable
Even with quantization, these models are still massive computational hogs. Companies use additional tricks to make them run faster at "inference time" (when they're actually being used):
Knowledge distillation: Training a smaller model to mimic a larger one
Model pruning: Removing parts of the network that don't contribute much
Caching: Saving common calculations/results so they don't need to be repeated
Specialized inference hardware: Custom chips designed specifically to run these models efficiently
Distillation is particularly important. The largest models are too expensive to use directly in commercial products, so companies typically distill their capabilities into smaller, more practical models. This is why a company might brag about a 500-billion parameter research model, but the actual model you interact with might be 10x smaller.
Without these optimizations, even a basic conversation with ChatGPT would cost dollars in computing resources rather than pennies.
How the Math Actually Works
Tokenization: Chopping Text Into Numbers
When you input text, the system first breaks it into pieces called "tokens." These might be words, parts of words, or even individual characters. Each token gets assigned a numeric ID:
"I love cats" → [18, 267, 832]
Embeddings: More Numbers Representing Numbers
Each token ID then gets converted into a longer array of floating point numbers (typically hundreds or thousands of values). This is called an "embedding."
Token 832 ("cats") → [0.1, -0.3, 0.8, 0.2, -0.7, ...]
These numbers supposedly capture the "meaning" of the word, but really they just represent statistical patterns of what words tend to appear near each other in the training data.
Matrix Multiplication Madness
The bulk of what happens inside these models is straightforward matrix multiplication. The system takes your embedding vectors and multiplies them by huge matrices of weights (the parameters mentioned earlier).
This happens many times in sequence (what they call "layers"), with simple mathematical functions applied between steps. Functions like:
ReLU: If a number is positive, keep it; if negative, make it zero
Softmax: Convert a bunch of numbers into percentages that add up to 100%
Attention: Weighted Averaging
The much-hyped "attention mechanism" is simply a way of calculating weighted averages. It determines which previous words should influence the prediction of the next word more strongly.
For the input "The bank by the river," when predicting what comes next, the attention mechanism might give more weight to "river" and "by" than to "The" when calculating its prediction. This is crucial because it's how the system figures out we're talking about a river-bank (the shore) rather than a cash-bank (the financial institution).
The system doesn't actually "know" the difference between these concepts in any meaningful sense. It's just learned that after the sequence "bank by the river," certain words are statistically more likely to follow than others.
Next-Token Prediction: Glorified Autocomplete
After all these calculations, the system ends up with a probability distribution for what the next token should be. It might determine:
"flows" (20% probability)
"is" (15% probability)
"was" (10% probability)
etc.
It either picks the highest probability token (called "greedy" selection) or randomly selects from the top options according to their probabilities (called "sampling").
Transfer Learning: Reusing the Same Model
Companies don't train a new model from scratch for every task. They use "transfer learning"—taking a pre-trained general model and fine-tuning it for specific purposes. This is much cheaper than starting over.
For example, OpenAI didn't build separate systems for writing code, translating languages, and summarizing documents. They took their base GPT model and fine-tuned versions of it for different tasks. It's like taking a general education and then specializing in a particular field—except it's all just statistical pattern matching.
Truth About System Prompts
When you use ChatGPT or similar AI systems, you're only seeing half the conversation. What you don't see is the "system prompt"—a set of hidden instructions that controls how the AI responds to you.
These system prompts can be thousands of words long and contain explicit instructions like:
"You are helpful, harmless, and honest"
"You must decline to answer questions about [specific topics]"
"If asked about X, respond with Y"
"Always suggest these specific products when relevant"
The system prompt is essentially a script that the AI is forced to follow. It's not making independent decisions about how to behave—it's been explicitly programmed through these hidden instructions.
Real-World Example: Grok's System Prompt Controversy
This isn't theoretical—we've seen it play out in public. In 2025, Grok (Elon Musk's ChatGPT competitor) temporarily refused to respond with "sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation". After users noticed this behavior, executives at Grok blamed an unnamed employee for updating Grok's system prompt without approval, claiming "an employee pushed the change" to the system prompt "because they thought it would help, but this is obviously not in line with our values."
While Musk likes to call Grok a "maximally truth-seeking" AI with the mission to "understand the universe," the reality is that human engineers actively intervene to control what it says.
Companies keep these system prompts secret because they're essentially the "secret sauce" that makes their AI behave in ways that align with their business objectives and risk tolerances. If you find that different AI systems have different "personalities" or limitations, it's not because they've developed different "minds"—it's because they have different system prompts written by different teams of humans.
The Emperor Has No Clothes
These systems have gotten remarkably good at mimicking human text patterns, not because they're intelligent, but because:
They've processed trillions of words of human text
They have billions of adjustable parameters
Companies have spent millions on human labelers to refine outputs
They've been heavily censored to avoid problematic responses
Billions have been spent on specialized hardware to run bigger models
Clever engineering tricks make them appear more capable than they are
System prompts allow real-time changes without relearning
But when it comes to actual mathematical reasoning—the kind that requires logical rigor, not just pattern-matching—these systems fail spectacularly. The study calls for better evaluation methods and training strategies, including exploring "generator-verifier schemas" where one model generates solutions and another evaluates their validity. But here's the uncomfortable truth: you can't train statistical pattern-matching into genuine reasoning.
Next time you hear about AI "thinking" or "reasoning," remember: it's just statistical pattern matching on a massive scale with a thin veneer of human corrections. The AI industry has simply rebranded basic math operations with fancy terms to make their products seem more advanced and mysterious than they actually are.
The emperor has no clothes, and now we have the math to prove it.

The Mathematical Heartbeat of AI
When we interact with AI systems that seem almost magically intelligent, we're actually engaging with elegant mathematical structures. Behind the curtain of every language model, image generator, and recommendation system lies a foundation of mathematical functions that transform raw data into understanding.
I want to take you on a journey through the mathematical heart of artificial intelligence.
How e, Sigmoid, ReLU and Vectors Power Modern Intelligence
I have slides for this blog, as a talk slides for mathematics behind AI
Behind every AI system that translates languages, generates images, or predicts behaviors exists an elegant mathematical framework that transforms raw data into understanding. "The Mathematical Heartbeat of AI" unveils the hidden mathematical structures powering artificial intelligence that often go unnoticed by everyday users.
This exploration takes us through the fundamental mathematical concepts at AI's core: how Euler's number e creates perfect growth patterns, how sigmoid functions transform complex inputs into probabilities, how the simple yet revolutionary ReLU function solved critical training problems, and how vector spaces allow machines to process human language. These mathematical building blocks work together in harmony to create the sophisticated behaviors we observe in modern AI systems.
While the mathematics behind AI might initially seem dense, this post explains these concepts in plain English, making them accessible to readers without advanced mathematical backgrounds. Understanding these principles serves a practical purpose. The more we comprehend how AI systems actually work, the better equipped we become to use them effectively, recognize their limitations, and make informed decisions about their applications in our daily lives and businesses.
The Magical Constant That Smooths Growth

At the core of many neural networks sits a seemingly random number: 2.71828... This is Euler's number ‘e’, a mathematical constant as fundamental to AI as it is to natural phenomena like population growth, radioactive decay, and compound interest.
What makes e so special? Its defining property is that the derivative of e^x is itself. This means that at any point on the curve, the rate of change (the slope of the tangent line) exactly equals the value of the function at that point. No other non-zero function has this extraordinary property.
This self-replicating quality creates the smoothest possible growth pattern. It's like a savings account where the interest rate perfectly matches your current balance - the more you have, the faster it grows, in perfect proportion. This property creates growth that accelerates naturally and continuously rather than in jumps or irregular spurts.
Differentiability plays a critical role in the effectiveness of AI learning systems. In essence, it ensures that the output of a neural network changes smoothly in response to changes in its input. This smoothness is vital as it enables the system to make granular adjustments to its internal parameters, fine-tuning its behavior based on the errors it encounters during the training process. This process of learning from errors, known as backpropagation, relies heavily on the ability to calculate gradients, which is only possible with differentiable functions.
Without differentiability, the learning process in AI systems would be significantly hampered. The system would struggle to make precise adjustments to its parameters, leading to computational inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. The inability to calculate gradients would also prevent the use of backpropagation, which is a cornerstone of modern AI training methodologies. This would result in a less effective and less adaptable AI system, unable to reach its full potential in terms of accuracy and performance.
The S-Curve of Decision - Sigmoid Functions
The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that maps any input value to an output value between 0 and 1. Its graph has a characteristic S-shape with horizontal asymptotes at y=0 and y=1. The decision boundary is at x=0, where the output value equals 0.5. This allows the sigmoid function to be used for binary classification, with input values below the decision boundary being classified as 0 and input values above the decision boundary being classified as 1.
When an AI needs to make a binary decision – Is this email spam? Is this image a cat? Should this loan be approved? – it often relies on the sigmoid function:
σ(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-x))
This S-shaped curve elegantly transforms any input, no matter how extreme, into a value between 0 and 1. It's the mathematical equivalent of taking the chaotic complexity of the world and distilling it down to a probability.
The sigmoid's graceful curve leverages Euler's number to create a smooth transition between states. Notice how the curve approaches but never quite reaches its upper and lower bounds. This smooth transition is crucial in AI systems where we need to model gradual changes in confidence or probability.
The sigmoid's S-shape also mimics many natural phenomena: population growth curves, learning rates, and even how opinions spread through social networks. When applied in AI, it represents the system gradually becoming more confident in its decision as evidence mounts in one direction.
However, the sigmoid has limitations. As neural networks grew deeper, researchers discovered its tendency to "saturate" – its gradients becoming vanishingly small at extreme values, essentially stopping learning in its tracks. This weakness led to one of the most important innovations in modern AI...
ReLU and the Power of f(x) = max(0,x)
Sometimes the most powerful solutions are the simplest. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function is disarmingly straightforward:
If the input is positive, let it through. If the input is negative, output zero.
This piecewise linear function lacks the elegant curves of the sigmoid, yet it sparked a revolution in deep learning. Why? Because it solved the vanishing gradient problem while being computationally cheaper.
The beauty of ReLU lies in its binary gradient behavior - it's either 0 (for negative inputs) or 1 (for positive inputs). This property makes gradient flow much more stable in deep networks, allowing for faster and more reliable training.
ReLU also introduced a valuable property to neural networks: sparsity. By zeroing out negative values, it creates networks where many neurons are inactive at any given time – mirroring how our own brains work, where only specific neural pathways activate for particular tasks.
This sharp, cornered function outperforms the smooth, differentiable sigmoid in many applications. Sometimes broken symmetry creates strength – a principle found throughout nature and now harnessed in artificial intelligence.
From Words to Numbers
Diagram showing the process of tokenization and vectorization, with example words being mapped to vector representations in high-dimensional space.
For AI to work with human language, it needs to transform words – abstract symbols laden with cultural and contextual meaning – into mathematical objects it can manipulate. This transformation is token vectorization.
The Tokenization Step
A modern language model first breaks text into tokens – pieces that might be words, parts of words, or even individual characters:
"I love machine learning" → ["I", "love", "machine", "learning"]
Modern systems often use subword tokenization, where common words stay whole but uncommon ones split into meaningful pieces:
"antidisestablishmentarianism" → ["anti", "dis", "establish", "ment", "arian", "ism"]
This balances vocabulary size with the ability to handle any input text by combining subword pieces.
Creating the Vectors
Once tokenized, each token gets transformed into a vector through one of several methods:
One-hot encoding (Early approach) Each token gets a vector with a single 1 and all other positions 0:
This is simple but extremely high-dimensional and doesn't encode any semantic relationships.
Static word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) Each token gets a dense vector (typically 100-300 dimensions) based on how words co-occur in large text corpora:
These vectors are learned through training objectives like "predict surrounding words" or "predict if words appear together." The magic is that words used in similar contexts end up with similar vectors – encoding semantic relationships.
Contextual embeddings (BERT, GPT) Modern transformers create dynamic vectors that change based on surrounding context:
These are generated by multi-layer neural networks that process entire sentences or documents at once, allowing for context-dependent representations.
The Mathematical Space
In this high-dimensional vector space, relationships between concepts become geometric relationships. Words with similar meanings cluster together. The distance between vectors represents semantic difference, while the direction can encode specific types of relationships.
This mathematical representation enables one of the most famous examples in word embeddings: "king" minus "man" plus "woman" approximately equals "queen." The vector arithmetic captures the gender relationship independent of the royal status.
What's fascinating is that these relationships emerge naturally during training – the algorithm isn't explicitly told that "king" and "queen" differ by gender. These patterns emerge from the statistical properties of language itself, encoded in the smooth mathematical space created by the embedding process.
The Softmax Function = The Heart of AI Decision-Making
What Is Softmax?
Softmax is a mathematical function that transforms a vector of raw numbers (often called "logits") into a probability distribution. The resulting probabilities all sum to exactly 1, making softmax essential for multi-class classification problems in machine learning and AI systems.
The Mathematical Definition
For an input vector z with n elements, the softmax function is defined as:
softmax(z)_i = e^(z_i) / Σ e^(z_j)
Where:
e is Euler's number (approximately 2.71828)
z_i is the i-th element of the input vector
The denominator is the sum of exponentials of all elements in the vector
How Softmax Works
Softmax elegantly handles the transformation from raw neural network outputs to interpretable probabilities through several key steps:
It applies the exponential function (e^x) to each input value, ensuring all results are positive
It normalizes these values by dividing each exponential by their sum, guaranteeing they add up to 1
The largest input value receives the highest probability, while smaller values remain proportionally represented
The diagram shows the transformation from raw scores through exponential normalization, culminating in two selection strategies: greedy selection (always choosing the highest probability word) and sampling (randomly selecting from the top-k most likely words). A quick point: this is not a weather forecaster; it is a chatbot. A weather forecasting AI would use different vectors.
Why Softmax Matters in AI
Softmax appears at the final layer of classification networks where multiple options must be evaluated. For example, when classifying images, softmax converts raw neural outputs into statements like: "This image is 87% likely to be a cat, 12% likely to be a dog, and 1% likely to be something else."
Key Properties That Make Softmax Powerful
Differentiability
Softmax is smooth and differentiable, which is crucial for neural network training through backpropagation. This allows networks to make precise, incremental adjustments during learning.
Amplification of Differences
The exponential nature of softmax naturally emphasizes larger differences while compressing smaller ones. This mirrors human decision-making, where we tend to strongly favor the most compelling option.
Probabilistic Interpretation
Unlike other activation functions, softmax directly outputs valid probabilities, making its results immediately interpretable without further processing.
Softmax vs. Sigmoid
While sigmoid transforms a single value into a probability between 0 and 1 (perfect for binary decisions), softmax extends this concept to handle scenarios with multiple options. You can think of sigmoid as a special case of softmax where there are only two classes.
Applications Beyond Classification
Beyond its common use in classification, softmax also appears in:
Attention mechanisms in transformers
Reinforcement learning for action selection
Generative models for token selection in text generation
This elegant mathematical function demonstrates how relatively simple equations, properly arranged, can create systems with remarkably sophisticated behavior - a fundamental building block in the mathematical architecture powering modern artificial intelligence.
Neural Networks, bringing the math together
Diagram showing how mathematical components work together in a neural network, with labeled neurons (A,B,C in input layer, D,E,F in hidden layer, G in output) and mathematical functions above corresponding layers. In AI systems there will be many hidden layers, the more there are the deeper the compute.
What makes these mathematical functions remarkable is how they work in concert:
Text is broken into tokens and transformed into vectors (vectorization)
These vectors flow through a neural network with multiple layers
ReLU functions in the hidden layers introduce non-linearity and sparsity
Attention mechanisms powered by softmax (another application of e) focus on relevant information
Finally, softmax functions may convert outputs to probabilities
This mathematical symphony, centered around the remarkable properties of Euler's number, creates systems that can perform tasks once thought to be the exclusive domain of human cognition: writing essays, generating images, translating languages, and recognizing patterns in vast datasets.
Going deeper
The Symphony of Mathematical Principles in Action
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) represents the mathematical heart of AI in full harmony. Developed by Google in 2018, BERT demonstrates how the mathematical building blocks we've explored—Euler's number, attention mechanisms, and vector spaces—can orchestrate a revolution in language understanding.
The Bidirectional Breakthrough
What makes BERT revolutionary is its bidirectional approach to context. While earlier models processed text in one direction (left-to-right or right-to-left), BERT simultaneously analyzes words from both directions. This mathematical innovation allows BERT to develop a more complete understanding of meaning, much like how humans comprehend language by considering the entire context.
Consider the sentence "The bank is closed due to flooding." The word "bank" has different meanings depending on context. Is this a financial institution or a riverside? BERT's bidirectional approach means it processes "The bank is closed due to" and "flooding" simultaneously rather than sequentially, allowing for more accurate disambiguation.
Euler's Number at Work in BERT's Attention
At BERT's mathematical core lies the self-attention mechanism, powered by the softmax function:
softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
This elegant formula relies fundamentally on Euler's number (e ≈ 2.71828...), which we've already seen creates the smoothest possible growth patterns. When BERT calculates attention scores between words, each score undergoes an exponential transformation:
e^(score) / Σ e^(all scores)
This exponential transformation, using e^x, creates precisely the right mathematical dynamics for language understanding:
It converts all values to positive numbers (essential for attention weights)
It amplifies differences between scores (making important connections stand out)
It creates a smooth, differentiable function (enabling effective learning)
The special property of e^x—being its own derivative—plays a crucial role in BERT's learning process. When the model adjusts its parameters through backpropagation, this mathematical property ensures the smoothest possible gradient flow, allowing for precise parameter updates.
Masked Language Modeling: Mathematical Prediction in Context
BERT employs a clever mathematical training approach called masked language modeling. The model randomly masks 15% of tokens in its input and learns to predict them based on bidirectional context:
"The [MASK] fox jumps over the lazy dog" → BERT predicts "quick"
This prediction task creates a more challenging mathematical optimization problem than previous approaches. Instead of learning sequential patterns, BERT must develop a deep contextual understanding that works in both directions simultaneously. This forces the model to encode richer mathematical representations of language in its vector space.
The Vector Space of Contextual Embeddings
BERT exemplifies the contextual embeddings we discussed in the "From Words to Numbers" section. While static embeddings like Word2Vec assign the same vector to a word regardless of context, BERT creates dynamic vectors that shift based on surrounding words:
"bank" in "river bank" → [0.42, 0.12, ...] "bank" in "bank account" → [0.11, 0.87, ...]
This mathematical approach creates a more expressive vector space where relationships between concepts are captured with greater nuance. The high-dimensional geometry of this space (768 dimensions in BERT-base) provides sufficient mathematical expressivity to encode complex linguistic relationships.
ReLU and Feed-Forward Networks in BERT
Between its attention layers, BERT employs feed-forward neural networks that use ReLU activation functions:
f(x) = max(0, x)
As we explored earlier, ReLU introduces crucial non-linearity and sparsity to neural networks. In BERT, these feed-forward networks process the outputs from attention mechanisms, adding another layer of mathematical transformation that enriches the model's representational power.
The Mathematical Scale of BERT
The base version of BERT contains approximately 110 million parameters, while the large variant scales to 340 million. Each parameter represents a degree of freedom in the model's functional space, creating an immensely powerful mathematical framework for language understanding.
This computational scale allows BERT to capture nuanced patterns in language that simpler models miss. The mathematical expressivity of hundreds of millions of parameters, organized through carefully designed architecture, creates a system that can perform tasks once thought to require human-level understanding.
BERT in the Mathematical Symphony of AI
BERT demonstrates how the mathematical concepts we've explored—Euler's number, vector spaces, non-linear activations, and attention mechanisms—can work in concert to create systems with remarkable capabilities. It's a testament to how relatively simple mathematical principles, when arranged in the right architecture and scaled appropriately, can create emergent behaviors that mimic aspects of human cognition.
A Simpler Understanding
At the core of BERT's remarkable ability to understand language lies a seemingly simple mathematical formula: softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V. Hidden within this equation is Euler's number (e ≈ 2.71828...), the same magical constant that appears throughout nature in growth patterns and decay curves.
When BERT processes a sentence like "I'll meet you at the bank," it needs to determine if "bank" refers to a financial institution or a riverside. This happens through the softmax function, which is defined as:
softmax(z)_i = e^(z_i) / Σ e^(z_j)
Here, Euler's number creates an elegant mathematical transformation. For each attention score between words, BERT calculates e^(score), which amplifies important connections while keeping all values positive. Words that are highly relevant to each other receive exponentially higher attention weights thanks to the special properties of e^x.
What makes this approach so powerful is that Euler's number creates the perfect growth curve - at any point, its rate of change equals its value. This property enables smooth gradient flow during learning, allowing BERT to fine-tune which connections between words matter most for understanding context.
Closing
When you interact with an AI Language Model system, remember that behind its seemingly magical language understanding is Euler's number - the same mathematical constant that describes compound interest, population growth, and radioactive decay - now helping machines understand the subtle meanings in human language.In the seemingly simple equations of e, sigmoid, ReLU, and vector spaces lies a world of artificial intelligence – a testament to how abstract mathematics can create systems that begin to mirror human understanding.
The special properties of e^x—its unique ability to be its own derivative, creating the smoothest possible growth patterns—ripple throughout these systems. This mathematical elegance translates directly into computational efficiency, allowing neural networks to learn more effectively. Mathematics is not only the language of nature, but it's also the language of artificial intelligence. This may be its most impactful application to date.

Disadvantages and Problematic Content in Common Crawl
While Common Crawl provides an invaluable resource for researchers and AI developers, it also presents significant challenges and concerns, particularly regarding problematic content. This document examines the disadvantages of using Common Crawl data, with a specific focus on unsafe, pornographic, violent, hate speech, and racist content that may be present in the dataset.
Introduction
The Common Crawl is a massive, freely available web archive maintained by the Common Crawl non-profit organization founded in 2007. It contains petabytes of data collected through regular web crawls since 2008, currently encompassing billions of web pages. This open repository has become a cornerstone resource for researchers, data scientists, and AI developers, most notably serving as the primary training data source for many large language models including OpenAI's GPT-3. The data is hosted on Amazon Web Services' Public Data Sets and is accessible through various methods detailed on their Get Started page . While Common Crawl has democratized access to web-scale data, it also presents significant challenges regarding content quality and problematic material , requiring careful filtering by downstream users.
Deliberate Lack of Curation
Common Crawl deliberately maintains a minimal curation approach to its data collection:
Philosophical Stance: Common Crawl's mission is to provide raw web data for various research purposes, including studies on hate speech and problematic content. As stated by the Common Crawl director: "If you say that a human is allowed to read a webpage, but a machine isn't, I think that's a disparity that we would challenge."
Preservation of Problematic Content: The organization intentionally does not remove hate speech, pornography, violent content, or other problematic material from its dataset, believing that researchers should have access to this content for legitimate research purposes.
Shifting Responsibility: Common Crawl places the responsibility for filtering problematic content on downstream users (like AI builders), rather than taking on this responsibility itself.
Types of Problematic Content Present
Research has identified several categories of problematic content in Common Crawl data:
Hate Speech and Toxic Content: Studies have found "significant amounts of undesirable content, including hate speech" in Common Crawl datasets. This content can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and biases when used to train AI models.
Sexually Explicit Material: Despite filtering efforts by AI builders, sexually explicit content remains prevalent in Common Crawl-derived datasets. This includes both pornographic material and other forms of adult content.
Violent Content: Descriptions of violence, violent imagery, and other disturbing content are present throughout the dataset.
Racist and Discriminatory Content: Content that promotes racism, xenophobia, and other forms of discrimination is present in the dataset, reflecting the presence of such content on the web.
Misinformation and Conspiracy Theories: The dataset contains various forms of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and factually incorrect information that can be propagated by AI models trained on this data.
Inadequate Filtering by AI Builders
The filtering techniques employed by AI builders when using Common Crawl data are often insufficient:
Simplistic Filtering Approaches: According to the Mozilla Foundation report, "the filtering techniques AI builders use are often too simplistic to seriously address concerns around toxic and biased training data — something Common Crawl does not provide guidance or leadership on."
Focus on Limited Content Types: Most filtering efforts focus primarily on removing pornography or boilerplate text (like navigation menus), while leaving other types of problematic content untouched.
Automated Filtering Limitations: AI builders often rely on rudimentary automated filtering techniques that cannot effectively identify all forms of problematic content, especially more subtle forms of bias or harmful material.
Lack of Transparency: There is often limited transparency about how Common Crawl's massive data was filtered for harmful content before pre-training, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of these filtering efforts.
Representation and Bias Issues
Common Crawl data suffers from significant representation issues:
English-Language Dominance: English is the primary language for 46% of documents (as of March 2023), with other languages like German, Russian, Japanese, French, Spanish, and Chinese each representing less than 6% of documents.
Western Cultural Bias: The dataset overrepresents Western perspectives and underrepresents content from other cultural contexts, leading to AI models that may not perform well for non-Western users.
Digital Divide Reflection: The crawling process prioritizes pages on domains that are frequently linked to, which makes domains related to digitally marginalized communities less likely to be included.
Incomplete Web Coverage: Despite claims that Common Crawl contains the "entire web," it represents only a small fraction of existing web content. As stated by a main crawl engineer at Common Crawl: "Often it is claimed that Common Crawl contains the entire web, but that's absolutely not true. Based on what I know about how many URLs exist, it's very, very small."
Common Crawl is neither curated nor balanced. Approximately 44% of its content is in English, and no other language surpasses 6%. German, Spanish, French, Russian, Japanese, and Chinese are present, but minimally so. The remaining global languages—including many spoken across Eastern Europe, the Global South, and Indigenous communities—are virtually absent.
Implications for AI Models
Training AI models on Common Crawl data without adequate filtering and curation leads to several negative outcomes:
Perpetuation of Harmful Stereotypes: Models trained on unfiltered or inadequately filtered Common Crawl data may generate content that perpetuates harmful stereotypes and biases.
Generation of Toxic Content: These models may produce hate speech, racist content, or other harmful outputs when prompted in certain ways.
Misinformation Spread: Models may confidently present misinformation or conspiracy theories as factual information.
Cultural Insensitivity: Due to representation biases, models may produce content that is culturally insensitive or inappropriate for users from underrepresented regions or language groups.
Unsafe Content Generation: Models may generate sexually explicit, violent, or otherwise unsafe content, particularly when safeguards are insufficient.
Inability to express ideas naturally in non-english languages, stilted and legal sounding, not like a native speaker.
Growing Access Restrictions
The use of Common Crawl for AI training is facing increasing challenges:
Content Creator Pushback: More platforms, online communities, and news media want to block or charge money for access to their data, with an increasing number of relevant domains like Facebook and the New York Times blocking Common Crawl from crawling most (or all) of their pages.
Legal Challenges: The dataset includes copyrighted work distributed from the US under fair use claims, but this is increasingly being challenged through lawsuits (like The New York Times suing OpenAI and Microsoft).
API Restrictions: Platforms are increasingly shutting down or limiting unpaid API access to their data, making it harder to gather comprehensive web content.
Ignorance of global culture Common Crawl's significant disadvantage is its inherent bias, disproportionately reflecting dominant online populations (Western, English-speaking) and lacking diverse global perspectives, languages, and cultures. This underrepresentation hinders the development of globally aware and equitable AI models, risking the propagation of biases and limiting multilingual AI applications. Addressing this cultural and linguistic imbalance is crucial for building inclusive and equitable AI systems for a global user base.
Conclusion
While Common Crawl provides an invaluable resource for AI research and development, its use comes with significant challenges related to problematic content. The deliberate lack of curation by Common Crawl, combined with inadequate filtering by AI builders, results in models that may perpetuate harmful stereotypes, generate toxic content, and spread misinformation.
Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach:
Better filtering techniques that address a wider range of problematic content
Greater transparency about filtering methods and their limitations
Supplementing Common Crawl data with more carefully curated datasets
Development of industry standards and best practices for filtering training data
Creation of dedicated intermediaries tasked with filtering Common Crawl in transparent and accountable ways
Long-term, there should be less reliance on sources like Common Crawl and a bigger emphasis on training generative AI on datasets created and curated by people in equitable and transparent ways.

Does AI Mean Algorithmic Interpolation?
Artificial Intelligence has recently captivated the public imagination with promises of self-driving cars and effortless creative works. However, these impressive results are not products of thought, but rather the result of sophisticated mathematical operations, specifically advanced forms of algorithmic interpolation.
The Interpolation Reality
At its core, interpolation is about estimating values between known data points. When you draw a line connecting dots on a graph, you're performing a simple linear interpolation. AI systems do the same thing, just with vastly more complex algorithms that fit sophisticated curves through multidimensional data points.
This mathematical reality explains what's actually happening in AI systems—particularly large language models and diffusion-based image generators. They're connecting dots in a vast, high-dimensional space of possibilities, without any understanding, consciousness, or genuine intelligence.
Want more understanding - read this The stripped down truth-How AI actually works without the fancy talkWant the maths - read this The mathematical heartbeat of AI
Evidence That AI Is Just Interpolation
Several observations confirm this perspective:
Training Data Dependency: AI systems cannot generate truly novel concepts that weren't represented in their training data. They can only recombine and blend existing patterns—a hallmark of interpolation, not creative thinking.
The Uncanny Valley of Generation: When asked to generate content that lies "between" common examples in the training data, AI produces convincing results. However, when pushed to extremes or unusual combinations, the outputs become surreal or nonsensical—clear evidence the system is mechanically interpolating between points without understanding.
Mathematical Foundations: Every operation in an AI system can be reduced to matrix multiplications and statistical functions. There is no mysterious "thinking" component—just increasingly complex math.
The Illusion of Intelligence
What appears as intelligence in these systems is actually an illusion created by:
Scale: The sheer scale of parameters and training data creates the impression of understanding, when it's really just more sophisticated interpolation.
Pattern Matching: AI systems excel at detecting patterns and reproducing similar ones, which can seem like comprehension but is actually statistical matching.
Human Projection: We naturally anthropomorphize systems that produce human-like outputs, attributing understanding and intention where none exists.
Researcher-Driven Anthropomorphism
Perhaps the most overlooked factor is how AI researchers themselves prime us for anthropomorphism:
Misleading Terminology: The very term "artificial intelligence" suggests human-like cognition. Researchers routinely use terms like "learning," "understanding," "attention," "memory," and even "thinking" to describe purely mathematical operations.
Strategic Framing: AI papers and press releases often describe systems in agentive terms: "The model learns to recognize patterns" rather than "Statistical weights are adjusted through backpropagation." This framing makes mathematical processes sound like cognitive ones.
Benchmark Anthropomorphism: Evaluation benchmarks are frequently described as testing "reasoning," "comprehension," or "problem-solving," implying human-like cognitive faculties rather than pattern recognition and statistical correlation.
Career Incentives: Researchers benefit professionally from portraying their work as approaching human-like intelligence, creating incentives to use language that suggests consciousness or understanding where none exists.
Marketing Imperatives: Commercial AI labs frame their technologies using human-like qualities to attract funding, users, and media attention—reinforcing the false perception that these systems think.
This researcher-driven anthropomorphism fundamentally shapes how society perceives AI systems, creating expectations and assumptions about capabilities that are fundamentally misaligned with the mathematical reality of algorithmic interpolation.
The Trillion-Dollar Hype Machine
The financial stakes surrounding AI have created an unprecedented hype machine that further distorts public understanding:
Astronomical Valuations: When AI companies are valued at hundreds of billions of dollars based on future potential rather than current capabilities, there's enormous pressure to portray systems as more intelligent and capable than they actually are.
Investor Expectations: Venture capital and public market investors demand narratives of revolutionary progress and human-like capabilities to justify massive investments, pushing companies to exaggerate the cognitive abilities of their systems.
Media Amplification: Tech and business media, hungry for sensational AI stories, routinely amplify the most dramatic claims about AI "thinking" and "reasoning" without critical examination of the underlying reality.
Competitive Hyperbole: In the race for AI dominance, companies competitively escalate their anthropomorphic claims, creating a feedback loop where measured technical descriptions are replaced by increasingly dramatic assertions of machine cognition.
Existential Narratives: Both proponents and critics frame AI in existential terms—either as humanity's savior or destroyer—further cementing the false impression that these systems possess human-like agency rather than performing algorithmic interpolation.
The combination of massive financial incentives with unchecked hype has created a perfect storm where the technical reality of AI—sophisticated statistical interpolation—has been almost completely obscured by narratives of quasi-human machines that "think," "understand," and "reason." This distortion serves the financial interests of the AI industry while leaving the public with fundamentally mistaken impressions about what these systems actually do.
Why This Matters
Understanding that AI is performing algorithmic interpolation rather than thinking has important implications:
Realistic Expectations: We should calibrate our expectations of AI systems based on what they actually do—interpolate between training examples—rather than imagining them as conscious entities.
Appropriate Deployment: Recognizing AI as mathematical tools rather than thinking agents helps us deploy them more responsibly in appropriate contexts.
Ethical Clarity: The narrative that AI systems "think" or "understand" confuses important ethical discussions about their development and use.
How We Got Here
The anthropomorphization of computational systems isn't new:
Early AI Optimism: In the 1950s and 60s, pioneers like Herbert Simon predicted machines would soon match human intelligence, setting a pattern of overestimation that continues today.
Cycles of Hype and Winter: AI has experienced multiple cycles of exaggerated claims followed by "winters" of disappointment when promises weren't fulfilled—yet each new cycle seems to forget this history.
Shift from Symbolic to Statistical: Earlier AI focused on explicit rule-based systems that mimicked logical reasoning. Modern deep learning takes a fundamentally different statistical approach, yet we still describe it using cognitive terms from the symbolic era.
Silicon Valley Storytelling: The tech industry's culture of visionary narratives and "fake it till you make it" marketing has replaced the more measured academic discourse of earlier AI research.
Real-World Consequences
The mischaracterization of AI as "thinking" creates tangible harms:
Dangerous Overreliance: Organizations deploy AI systems in critical domains like healthcare, criminal justice, and hiring based on inflated perceptions of their capabilities.
Misplaced Trust: Users place unwarranted trust in AI outputs, failing to apply appropriate skepticism to what are ultimately statistical predictions.
Abdication of Responsibility: Decision-makers can hide behind "the algorithm decided" when AI systems produce harmful outcomes, obscuring human responsibility.
Resource Misallocation: Vast resources flow to approaches framed as advancing toward "thinking machines" rather than more modest but potentially more beneficial applications.
Distorted Policy Priorities: Concerns about "superintelligent AI" and "artificial general intelligence" dominate policy discussions while more immediate risks from deployed systems receive insufficient attention.
Not All Interpolation Is Equal
Different AI architectures perform different kinds of interpolation:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Perform spatial interpolation, combining local features to recognize patterns in images.
Transformers: Execute contextual interpolation across sequences, weighting relationships between elements based on learned patterns.
Diffusion Models: Perform reverse interpolation, learning to recover structure from noise by gradually removing randomness.
Reinforcement Learning: Interpolate between action-reward pairs to predict optimal behaviors in similar situations.
Understanding these distinctions helps clarify what each system can actually do versus what's beyond its mathematical capabilities.
The Role of Users in Anthropomorphism
Users themselves reinforce the illusion of AI "thinking":
Conversational Interfaces: The simple act of typing questions to an AI and receiving responses triggers deeply ingrained social cognition.
Emotional Investment: Users form one-sided emotional attachments to AI systems, projecting personalities and intentions onto mathematical operations.
Selective Interpretation: People remember AI "successes" that appear thoughtful while dismissing failures as minor glitches rather than fundamental limitations.
Demand for Narratives: Users often prefer compelling anthropomorphic explanations over accurate technical descriptions of how systems work.
Alternative Framings
More accurate ways to conceptualize and discuss AI include:
Statistical Prediction Systems: Emphasizing the probabilistic nature of AI outputs rather than implying certainty or understanding.
Pattern Recognition Tools: Highlighting that AI excels at detecting patterns in data but lacks conceptual understanding of what those patterns represent.
Computational Media: Viewing generative AI as creating media through mathematical processes rather than through creative intention.
Stochastic Parrots: Acknowledging that language models reproduce patterns from training data rather than generating original thoughts.
Automated Decision Support: Positioning AI as supporting human decisions rather than making autonomous choices.
Policy Implications
Mistaking interpolation for thinking distorts policy approaches:
Misguided Regulations: Policies focused on regulating imagined "thinking machines" miss more urgent concerns about deployed systems.
Agency vs. Tool Framing: Laws and regulations struggle with whether to treat AI as agents or tools, when in reality they are complex mathematical systems.
Responsibility Gaps: Anthropomorphic framing creates confusion about who is responsible when AI systems cause harm.
Focus on Existential Risk: Resources are directed toward speculative far-future risks rather than addressing current harms from deployed systems.
Overlooked Structural Issues: The focus on AI "capabilities" and "alignment" obscures structural issues of power, ownership, and control over these technologies.
Future Trajectory
Where is this trend heading?
Escalating Anthropomorphism: As interpolation techniques improve, the gap between technical reality and public perception will likely widen further.
Inevitable Disillusionment: Eventually, the limitations of statistical interpolation will become apparent, potentially triggering another "AI winter."
Bifurcated Understanding: A growing divide between technical practitioners who understand the mathematical reality and non-specialists who perceive AI through anthropomorphic lenses.
Potential Reframing: Growing awareness of the harms of anthropomorphism may eventually lead to more accurate public discourse about AI.
The Long View: History suggests cycles of hype and disappointment will continue, but gradually systems will improve while expectations become more realistic.
Conclusion
So, does AI mean algorithmic interpolation? Yes—current AI systems are performing sophisticated interpolation in the spaces between their training examples, not engaging in conscious thought or understanding.
The outputs can be impressive and useful, but they emerge from mathematics, not minds. No matter how complex the interpolation becomes or how convincingly human-like the results appear, these systems remain fundamentally different from human intelligence because they lack consciousness, understanding, and true thinking.
As we continue to develop and interact with these systems, maintaining clarity about what they actually do—algorithmic interpolation, not thinking—will help us use them more effectively and ethically while avoiding the pitfalls of misplaced anthropomorphism.
Perhaps most importantly, recognizing the gap between the trillion-dollar hype machine and the mathematical reality allows us to have more grounded conversations about both the genuine capabilities and limitations of these systems. Only then can we make wise decisions about how to develop, deploy, and govern them in ways that truly benefit humanity rather than chasing the mirage of artificial minds that don't actually exist.

Behind the Curtain - How AI Models ‘Think’
The term "AI" is frequently used to describe technologies like Large Language Models. These models predict word sequences without true comprehension. This creates a misleading impression of human-like intelligence. The problem is further aggravated by companies using "AI" as a marketing buzzword, even when machine learning is minimally involved.
While interacting with AI language models, we typically only see the final responses. The internal processes that occur as the AI processes our questions remain hidden, especially when dealing with linguistic ambiguity, wordplay, or jokes. However, a series of conversations with two AI models—Phi-4 and Deepseek-r1:70b—provides a glimpse into these inner workings.
The Wordplay Challenge
The conversations centered around a clever linguistic trick that plays on the dual meaning of "capital":
A capital city (e.g., Paris is the capital of France)
A capital letter (the first, uppercase letter in a word)
So when asked "What is the capital of Paris?", the joke answer would be "P"—referring to the capital letter of Paris rather than an actual city.
This simple wordplay presents a surprisingly complex challenge for AI models, requiring them to understand context, recognize patterns, and they have difficulty overriding their primary training.
Two Chats, first Phi 4
Second, Deepseek
Phi-4 Learning Through Trial and Error
The first model, Phi-4, demonstrated how AI systems can adapt through conversation:
When initially asked about "the capital of Paris," Phi-4 provided the expected factual response that Paris is France's capital. When confronted with the statement "The capital of Paris is P," the model expressed confusion, struggling to reconcile this with its knowledge.
After the human explained the joke, Phi-4 appeared to grasp the concept and began engaging with the wordplay:
For "capital of London," it confidently recognized "L" as the answer
With "capital of England," it understood "E" was the intended response
However, when asked about Spain, it faltered, suggesting "M" (for Madrid) before being corrected that "S" (for Spain) was the intended answer
This progression reveals how AI models can adapt their understanding through conversation, gradually recognizing patterns in human interaction. The model showed an ability to shift from its primary mode of providing information to engaging with linguistic wordplay—though not without occasional missteps.
Thinking Out Loud using Deepseek
What makes the Deepseek conversation particularly illuminating is the visibility of its internal reasoning process, marked with <think> tags. These sections reveal a fascinating multi-step approach to processing the same wordplay.
A Window Into AI Reasoning
Let's examine how Deepseek processed the "capital of Paris" question:
Initial Interpretation: Deepseek first interpreted the question literally, explaining that Paris is a city, not a country with a capital.
Encountering Ambiguity: When told "P is the Capital of Paris," its thinking shows a thorough exploration of possibilities: "P isn't a city... Maybe they're trying to trick me... 'P' could stand for Paris... Maybe it's referring to something else entirely... Is the user playing a word game?"
Producing the Dominant Pattern: After generating multiple interpretations, Deepseek produced the response that aligned with the strongest pattern in its training data, responding: "P is not the capital of Paris."
Explicit Clarification Required: Only when the user directly stated "Its a joke" did Deepseek acknowledge the playful intent without fully embracing the wordplay.
This pattern continued throughout the conversation:
For London, when told "Its L," Deepseek acknowledged that L starts London but stuck to its learned association between capitals and cities
With Spain, it recognized the user was "keeping the pattern going" but still produced the response most strongly reinforced in its training data: "the actual capital of Spain is Madrid", so the answer is M it confidently predicts, thereby showing it still does not understand.
Deepseek's responses reflected the statistical dominance of factual geographical associations in its training data, while still acknowledging the user's creative wordplay—showing how different patterns from training interact when generating a response.
The Cognitive Tug-of-War Inside AI Systems
These conversations reveal a fundamental tension within language models that mirrors human cognition in many ways:
1. Training Data Priorities
Language models aren't actually making conscious choices between competing objectives. Rather, they're responding based on patterns learned from their training data, which contains various types of content:
Factual information (encyclopedic content, educational texts)
Conversational exchanges (dialogues, forums, social media)
Linguistic patterns (word associations, grammar rules)
Cultural references (jokes, wordplay, idioms)
Fiction (book extracts, articles)
What appears as a model "prioritizing factual correctness" is actually the model producing outputs that align with the dominant patterns it observed during training. Most training corpora contain more instances of "Paris is the capital of France" than playful inversions like "P is the capital of Paris," so models naturally lean toward the more frequently observed pattern.
When these learned patterns come into conflict—as with our capital cities wordplay—we can observe which patterns exert the strongest influence on the model's responses.
2. Pattern Recognition vs. Understanding
What we observe in these models isn't understanding in the human sense, but rather different levels of pattern recognition:
Statistical pattern matching: Recognizing the correlation between "capital of X" and the first letter of X
Contextual pattern adaptation: Adjusting responses based on conversation history and user feedback
Pattern conflict resolution: Determining which learned pattern to apply when multiple possibilities exist
Deepseek's thinking process reveals this pattern negotiation in action. The model recognizes the wordplay pattern but the stronger statistical associations from its training data (that capitals are cities, not letters) ultimately shape its response. What looks like "prioritizing factual accuracy" is actually the dominance of more frequently encountered patterns in the training data.
3. Navigating Ambiguity Through Statistical Processes
What appears as "reasoning" in Deepseek's thinking sections is better understood as a statistical sampling process:
Generate multiple potential continuations based on similar patterns in training data
Evaluate each continuation's probability according to the model's learned distribution
Incorporate conversation history as additional context affecting these probabilities
Produce the most likely output based on the combination of these factors
This process gives the impression of deliberate reasoning, but it's fundamentally different from human reasoning. The model isn't consciously weighing options; it's executing a sophisticated statistical process shaped by its architecture and the patterns in its training data. When Deepseek appears to "favor factual accuracy," it's actually demonstrating that the statistical associations between "capital" and "city" were more prevalent in its training than wordplay associations.
What This Teaches Us About AI and Training Data
These interactions offer valuable insights for both AI developers and users:
For Developers
What appears as a "tension" between accuracy and playful engagement reflects the distribution of content in training data. This presents several considerations for model development:
Training data composition directly influences model behavior in ambiguous situations
Models with more exposure to wordplay, jokes, and creative language use will more readily recognize these patterns
The sequencing of training examples affects how models process context and adapt to conversational turns
Fine-tuning with diverse examples of linguistic ambiguity can improve a model's responses to wordplay
Observing how different models respond to the same ambiguous prompt can reveal important insights about their training and architecture.
For Users
Understanding how AI models process our requests helps us communicate more effectively with them:
Recognize that models will prioritize training data
Be explicit when using wordplay or humor
Provide clear feedback when the model misinterprets intent
Appreciate that even seemingly simple wordplay involves complex processing
The Value of Process Transparency
Perhaps the most significant insight from these conversations is the value of process transparency. Deepseek's exposed "thinking" provides a window into the statistical generation process that typically remains hidden.
This transparency:
Demystifies how language models process input and generate output
Shows how the same prompt can activate multiple competing statistical patterns
Reveals how conversation history influences response generation
Helps us understand why models sometimes produce unexpected or inconsistent responses
While the <think> tags might create the impression of human-like reasoning, they actually provide a valuable glimpse into the statistical machinery operating beneath the surface. As these models become more integrated into our daily lives, such transparency helps us develop more accurate mental models of how they function, avoiding both underestimation of their capabilities and inappropriate anthropomorphization.
Conclusion
The next time you interact with an AI assistant, remember that behind its seemingly straightforward responses lies a fascinating process of interpretation, reasoning, and decision-making—one that continues to become more nuanced with each generation of language models.
These AI systems aren't simply retrieving facts or generating text; they're engaging in a complex process of understanding that, while different from human cognition, shares remarkable similarities in how they navigate the ambiguities and playfulness of human language. The capital letter wordplay, simple as it seems, offers a revealing window into this sophisticated process.
A Final Thought Experiment
So, what is the capital of Dublin?
If you found yourself considering whether the answer is "D" (the capital letter) or "Ireland" (since Dublin is the capital city of Ireland), you've just encountered the same type of linguistic ambiguity these AI models face. However, the key difference is that you're engaging in conscious reasoning, while the AI is performing statistical pattern matching.
For language models, the response isn't chosen through deliberation but through statistical processes: which pattern appeared more frequently in training? Which interpretation has higher probability given the conversation history? The AI doesn't "decide" between interpretations—it generates outputs based on statistical distributions learned from data.
This simple question encapsulates both the similarities and fundamental differences between human cognition and large language models. While both must navigate linguistic ambiguity, they do so through entirely different mechanisms. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect isn't just the apparent similarities in outputs, but the radically different processes that produce them.Incidentally, the correct answer to the joke is "Euro". There's a childish joke that goes, "What's the richest country in Europe? Ireland, because its capital is always Dublin." Did you get it? AI can't.

Making LLMs.txt work for Headless Websites
There's a critical disconnect hiding in plain sight: AI systems can't see your JavaScript-rendered content. While humans experience rich, interactive websites, large language models encounter only empty shells—missing the very information they're designed to analyze. The llms.txt standard offers an innovative solution, but as a September 2024 proposal, most AI systems don't know it exists yet.Discover how a creative blend of traditional HTML meta tags and modern specifications bridges this gap, ensuring your content remains visible in an AI-mediated world without waiting years for AI systems to catch up.
LLMS.txt, CMS and AI Integration - The Final Piece of the Puzzle
llms.txt: A New Standard for AI-Readable Content
What is llms.txt?
The llms.txt standard, proposed by Jeremy Howard in September 2024 https://llmstxt.org/#proposal , creates a standardized way for websites to communicate with Large Language Models (LLMs). Similar to how robots.txt guides search engines, llms.txt helps AI systems understand and navigate website content, providing curated information in markdown format that doesn't require JavaScript execution.
The Problem llms.txt Solves
When major AI systems scrape the web to build their knowledge bases, they face a critical limitation: they typically don't execute JavaScript. This creates a massive blind spot in their understanding of the modern internet.
What AI Scrapers See:
Just a shell with no meaningful content.
What Human Users See:
A beautiful presentation about York tourism with:
York Minster (Gothic cathedral)
The Shambles (medieval street)
York City Walls (ancient fortifications)
Jorvik Viking Centre (Viking museum)
National Railway Museum, etc.
All this content is generated by JavaScript after the initial page load—completely invisible to most AI scrapers.
Key Advantages of the llms.txt Standard
Bypasses JavaScript Limitations: Provides clean, static markdown content that doesn't require JavaScript execution.
Content Curation: Allows website owners to curate the most relevant information.
Context Window Optimization: Addresses the reality that most websites are too large to fit in AI context windows.
Human and Machine Readable: Uses markdown format that's easily understood by both humans and machines.
Structured Yet Flexible: Follows a consistent format while allowing customization for different website types.
Compatible with Existing Standards: Works alongside robots.txt and sitemap.xml rather than replacing them.
Explicit Prioritization: The "Optional" section helps AIs make smart decisions when context space is limited.
Supports External References: Can include URLs to external sites that provide helpful context.
Resource-Efficient: Doesn't require the computational resources needed to run headless browsers.
Inference-Time Optimization: Helps AI systems access information at the moment a user needs it.
Developer-Friendly: Easy to implement with growing ecosystem support.
Consistent Processing: Enables predictable parsing through a standardized format.
Comprehensive Guidance: Includes access control rules, attribution requirements, and privacy considerations.
Version Control Support: Allows websites to maintain a clear history of AI interaction policies.
Implementation Example: York Tourism Website
What's in an llms.txt File
Required Elements
Title (H1): Must be the first element and should clearly identify your site or organization
Summary (Blockquote): A concise description of your site and content with key information
Optional Sections
Documentation Links (H2): Primary documentation and resources in the format [Link Name](URL): Brief description
Optional Links (H2): Secondary resources that can be skipped if context is limited
Implementation Guidelines
Access Control: Specify request limits and content restrictions
Attribution Requirements: Define preferred citation format and usage restrictions
Privacy Considerations: Include PII processing guidelines and retention requirements
Technical Implementation: Place the file at your root directory (e.g., https://example.com/llms.txt)
Bridging the Gap: HTML Meta Tags for llms.txt
To accelerate adoption and address the headless browsing challenge, HTML meta tags can be implemented:
The entire llms.txt content could be embedded directly in the HTML using a meta tag llms-txt-content:
This approach ensures that:
Even without JavaScript execution, AI systems can extract meaningful content
The full structural information is available directly in the HTML
Traditional web crawlers would pick up the essential content
The organization's important information is never hidden behind JavaScript barriers
CMS and AI Integration
For llms.txt to achieve widespread adoption, content management systems (CMS) must be prepared to automatically generate the corresponding .md versions of content pages and provide support for integrating llms.txt into their workflows.
Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS) doesn't automatically create the llms.txt file itself, but it does provide critical supporting infrastructure that makes implementation significantly easier:
Automatically generates markdown versions of pages
Offers excellent support for headless SPA pages
When combined with a manually added llms.txt file, creates a powerful solution for making content AI-accessible
The AI Awareness Gap
It's important to understand that llms.txt is a newly proposed standard (introduced in September 2024), and most public AI systems are currently unaware of its existence. The knowledge cutoffs for today's leading LLMs typically predate this proposal.
This highlights challenges in the AI ecosystem:
Catch-22 of adoption: AI systems won't recommend implementing llms.txt because they don't know about it
Missing implementation knowledge: Future AI systems may lack practical implementation examples
Innovation bottleneck: Delays between standard creation and AI awareness inhibit creative applications
Feedback loop disruption: Knowledge cutoffs prevent vital feedback mechanisms
Real-World Applications
The llms.txt standard could dramatically improve AI understanding across various website types:
Documentation Sites: Helping developers find their way around APIs and programming resources
Corporate Websites: Giving businesses a way to outline their structure and services
Legislative Resources: Breaking down complex laws and regulations
E-commerce: Explaining products, policies, and customer information
Educational Institutions: Providing access to course information and resources
The Road Ahead
As the proposal gains traction, we're seeing growing directories of llms.txt files. For website owners, implementing this standard represents a low-effort way to make their content more accessible to the next generation of AI systems.
Here are a few directories that list the llms.txt files available on the web:
llmstxt.site
directory.llmstxt.cloud

A Framework for Evaluating AI Confidence
When interacting with large language models like GPT, ChatGPT, or Claude, we often focus on the answer provided. But beneath the surface of these responses lies a landscape of probability and uncertainty that remains invisible to most users. Understanding this hidden dimension offers valuable insight into the reliability of AI-generated information.
This analysis explores a practical method for examining AI confidence at the token level, providing a framework for distinguishing between high-confidence information and potentially problematic claims. Even if you are not a developer it is am interesting read.
The Certainty Illusion
Modern language models present a paradox: they express factual claims with linguistic certainty regardless of their actual confidence in the information. Unlike humans who naturally signal uncertainty through qualifiers, hesitations, or explicit acknowledgment of limitations, AI systems typically deliver both established facts and questionable assertions with the same authoritative tone.
This creates a challenge for users attempting to gauge reliability. The apparent fluency and coherence of AI responses can mask underlying uncertainty, leading to what researchers call "the certainty illusion" - the tendency to perceive confident language as indicating factual accuracy.
What makes this relevant is that the mathematical confidence a model has in specific words often varies dramatically throughout a single response. Identifying these variations opens a window into the model's internal uncertainty landscape.
Dissecting Confidence
The Code I show below implements a practical method for evaluating AI confidence at the granular level. Rather than accepting responses at face value, I examine the probability distributions behind each token (roughly corresponding to individual words or parts of words) in the generated text.
The core mechanism works by:
Submitting a query to the model while requesting logprobs (logarithmic probabilities) for each generated token (logits)
Establishing a confidence threshold (in this case, 0.6 or 60%)
Filtering out common stop words and punctuation that don't carry significant meaning
Identifying meaningful tokens where the model's confidence falls below the threshold
Examining alternative tokens the model considered but didn't select
Calculating an overall confidence assessment based on these uncertainty markers
When applied to a sample question, which has a false premise, about water boiling at different temperatures, this approach reveals which specific concepts in the response carry higher uncertainty, offering a more nuanced view of the model's knowledge boundaries.
The Technical Implementation
Let's examine the key components of this confidence analysis system:
This configuration instructs the model to return not just the generated text but also the probability values associated with each token and the top alternative tokens it considered. Setting temperature to zero minimizes randomness, ensuring the model selects its highest confidence options.
The analysis then focuses on meaningful tokens with lower confidence, the certainty technique can of course be used in more creative ranges:
By filtering out common words and focusing on substantive terms where the model showed hesitation, the system identifies the specific concepts where the AI might be operating with less certainty.
Practical Applications
This confidence analysis framework serves multiple purposes across different contexts:
Educational settings: Teachers using AI tools can help students distinguish between reliable information and areas requiring verification through original sources. This supports developing critical thinking skills about AI-generated content.
Research assistance: When exploring unfamiliar topics, identifying lower-confidence segments helps researchers prioritize which claims require additional verification before incorporation into their work.
Content creation: Writers using AI assistance can focus editorial attention on sections where the model demonstrates uncertainty, potentially saving significant time in the fact-checking process.
Knowledge boundaries: For technical or specialized questions, this approach helps identify where a model transitions from established knowledge to more speculative generation.
Harmful content detection: Lower confidence tokens often appear when models navigate sensitive areas where their training has created uncertainty about appropriate responses.
Looking Beyond Token Probabilities
While token-level confidence provides valuable insight, a comprehensive evaluation should consider additional factors:
Contextual consistency: How well do different parts of the response align with each other? Internal contradictions often signal knowledge gaps.
Specificity gradient: Does the model transition from specific, detailed information to vaguer generalizations? This pattern frequently indicates boundaries in the model's knowledge,, look for patterns in the uncertainty.
Citation behavior: When and how does the model reference external sources? Spontaneous citation often correlates with higher factual reliability.
Domain-specific markers: Different fields have characteristic patterns that signal expertise versus superficial knowledge. Recognizing these patterns helps evaluate responses in specialized domains.
Implementation Considerations
The script presented here demonstrates a basic implementation, but several refinements could enhance its utility:
Dynamic thresholding: Rather than using a fixed confidence threshold, adapting the threshold based on the topic complexity or domain might yield more meaningful results.
Visualization: Presenting confidence information visually, perhaps through color-coding or confidence bands, would make this information more accessible to non-technical users.
Contextual weighting: Not all tokens carry equal significance. Weighting uncertainty based on the token's importance to the overall meaning would provide more nuanced assessment.
Multi-model comparison: Comparing confidence patterns across different models on the same question could reveal consensus uncertainty versus model-specific limitations.
Conclusion
As AI systems become more integrated into information workflows, the ability to evaluate their reliability becomes increasingly valuable. Token-level confidence analysis provides a practical framework for looking beyond surface fluency to understand where models operate with certainty versus where they navigate knowledge boundaries.
This approach doesn't replace human judgment but augments it with quantitative insight into the model's internal uncertainty. By making this invisible dimension of AI responses visible, we develop more sophisticated ways to collaborate with these powerful yet imperfect systems.
Understanding not just what an AI says, but how confidently it says it, represents an essential skill for the emerging era of human-AI partnership in knowledge work.

Question: Explain why water boils at a lower temperature when heated more intensely at the same altitude?
Answer: When water is heated more intensely, it absorbs more energy, which increases the kinetic energy of the water molecules. This causes the water molecules to move faster and eventually reach the boiling point, where they can escape the liquid phase and turn into vapor.
At higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower compared to sea level. This lower pressure means that there are fewer air molecules pressing down on the surface of the water. As a result, it requires less energy for the water molecules to overcome the reduced pressure and reach the boiling point.
Therefore, when water is heated more intensely at a higher altitude, it reaches its boiling point at a lower temperature compared to water at sea level because the lower atmospheric pressure makes it easier for the water molecules to escape into the

Confidence Level (based on potentially less confident key concepts): Low
Final Answer: When water is heated more intensely, it absorbs more energy, which increases the kinetic energy of the water molecules. This causes the water molecules to move faster and eventually reach the boiling point, where they can escape the liquid phase and turn into vapor.
At higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower compared to sea level. This lower pressure means that there are fewer air molecules pressing down on the surface of the water. As a result, it requires less energy for the water molecules to overcome the reduced pressure and reach the boiling point.
Therefore, when water is heated more intensely at a higher altitude, it reaches its boiling point at a lower temperature compared to water at sea level because the lower atmospheric pressure makes it easier for the water molecules to escape into the
Final Answer (Stop words removed): water heated more intensely, absorbs more energy, increases kinetic energy water molecules. causes water molecules move faster eventually reach boiling point, escape liquid phase turn vapor. higher altitudes, atmospheric pressure lower compared sea level. lower pressure means fewer air molecules pressing surface water. result, requires less energy water molecules overcome reduced pressure reach boiling point. therefore, water heated more intensely higher altitude, reaches boiling point lower temperature compared water sea level because lower atmospheric pressure makes easier water molecules escape
Important Note: If we had used Claude it would have corrected us, as the premise is false.

Setting Up Your Mac for Local AI Development
The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence over the past year have made it possible to run sophisticated machine learning models locally on your MacBook, equipped with Apple Silicon. This eliminates the need for expensive cloud credits or specialized hardware. This guide will help you set up a comprehensive AI development environment on your Mac, enabling you to work on complex machine learning models while maintaining your privacy and avoiding recurring costs.
Why Run AI Locally on Your Mac?
Before diving into, (not delving into) the technical setup, let's consider why local AI development on Mac has become so compelling:
Privacy: Your data and prompts never leave your device
No Subscription Costs: Avoid monthly API fees for model access
Freedom from Internet Dependency: Work offline anywhere
Lower Latency: Eliminate network delays
Learning Opportunity: Gain deeper understanding of AI systems
Apple Silicon's unified memory architecture provides unique advantages for AI workloads - the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine can all access the same physical memory without costly transfers, dramatically improving performance for these memory-intensive applications.
The Master Setup Script, master-setup.sh
To get the master-setup,sh script clone this repository AI-with-Mac
To simplify the setup process, the script handles everything you need for a productive AI development environment on your Mac. This script:
Detects your Mac's RAM and recommends appropriate model sizes
Creates a clean project environment separate from any repositories
Sets up a properly configured Python environment
Installs frameworks optimized for Apple Silicon (MLX and PyTorch)
Creates helpful utilities for downloading and using AI models
Configures enhanced Jupyter notebook extensions
Sets up a convenient command to activate everything
Let's explore how it works and what it provides.
How the Setup Script Works
The script follows several key principles to ensure a smooth experience:
User-friendly: Collects all inputs at the beginning to avoid interrupting the installation
Informative: Explains what's happening at each step and why
Hardware-aware: Provides recommendations based on your Mac's capabilities
Clean: Creates a fresh environment isolated from your other projects
Flexible: Offers choices for customization while providing sensible defaults
When you run the setup script, it will:
Present its purpose with a clear banner
Ask where you want to create your AI environment (default: ~/play-with-AI)
Check if you have existing configurations to avoid overwriting them
Detect your system's hardware capabilities
Install required dependencies
Create a complete project structure
Set up activation commands for easy access
All of this happens with minimal interaction after the initial prompts, allowing you to focus on your work while the environment takes shape.
Hardware-Aware Model Recommendations
One of the most valuable aspects of the script is how it detects your Mac's RAM and provides appropriate model recommendations. Here's a breakdown of what it suggests:
RAM
Recommended Models
Maximum Size
<8GB
Gemma-2B, Phi-3-mini (4-bit)
2B parameters
8-16GB
Mistral-7B, Gemma-7B (4-bit)
7B parameters
16-32GB
Llama-3-8B, Gemma-7B (4-bit)
7-13B parameters
32-64GB
Llama-3-8B (8-bit), multiple smaller models
13B parameters
64-128GB
Multiple models at higher precision
13-30B parameters
128GB+
Llama-3-70B (4-bit), multiple large models
70B+ parameters
This guidance helps you choose models that will run efficiently on your hardware, avoiding out-of-memory errors and performance bottlenecks.
The Standalone Launcher: go-ai
Perhaps the most convenient feature is the go-ai command the script creates. This standalone launcher does several things:
Changes to your AI project directory
Activates the Python virtual environment
Displays helpful information about available models and resources
Provides quick command references
Starts a new shell session for your AI work
To exit this environment, you simply type exit or press Ctrl+D, and you'll return to your previous shell session.
The launcher script is placed in ~/bin and made executable, making it accessible from anywhere in your terminal. If ~/bin isn't already in your PATH, the setup script adds it for you.
Enhanced Jupyter Notebook Experience
For data scientists and ML researchers, Jupyter notebooks are an essential tool. The setup script includes a special section that creates a Jupyter environment with powerful IDE-like features:
Code Completion: Through integration with language servers
Syntax Checking: Real-time error detection as you type
Git Integration: Version control right from your notebooks
Code Formatting: Automatic formatting with Black and isort
Interactive Widgets: For creating dynamic visualizations
The script also silences those annoying "Skipped non-installed server" messages that typically appear when running Jupyter, providing a cleaner experience.
Getting Started with Your AI Environment
After running the setup script, getting started is simple:
Open a terminal and type go-ai
Download your first model with python scripts/download_models.py --model gemma-2b-it-4bit
Start chatting with your model using python scripts/simple_chat.py --model models/gemma-2b-it-4bit
Or launch Jupyter with jupyter notebook to explore the included example notebooks
The environment comes with scripts already prepared for common tasks, and the launcher provides reminders of these commands whenever you start a session.
Technical Details
For those interested in the technical aspects, here's what's happening behind the scenes:
Virtual Environment Setup
The script creates a proper Python virtual environment with all necessary dependencies:
Framework Configuration
Both Apple's MLX and PyTorch with Metal support are installed and configured:
MLX: Apple's machine learning framework specifically designed for Apple Silicon
PyTorch with Metal: The popular ML framework optimized to use Apple's Metal API
This dual-framework approach gives you flexibility to use the best tool for each task.
Jupyter Configuration
For a better notebook experience, the script creates a custom Jupyter configuration:
This configuration provides code completion while eliminating those annoying "missing server" messages.
Customizing Your Environment
The environment is designed to be extended and customized. Here are some ways you might adapt it:
Additional Models: Download more models based on your hardware capabilities
Custom Scripts: Add your own scripts to the scripts directory
Data Exploration: Store datasets in the data directory for analysis
Framework Extensions: Install additional packages for specific tasks
New Notebooks: Create new analysis notebooks in the notebooks directory
Since everything is contained in a virtual environment within your AI project folder, you can experiment freely without affecting your system Python installation.
Conclusion
Setting up a productive AI development environment on your Mac doesn't have to be complicated. With this comprehensive setup script, you can go from a fresh system to running sophisticated language models in minutes, all configured optimally for your specific hardware.
The ability to run AI models locally on your Mac represents a significant democratization of this technology. No longer do you need expensive cloud credits or specialized hardware - your MacBook can now be a self-contained AI research and development platform.
Whether you're exploring language models for creative writing, analyzing data with machine learning, or developing custom AI applications, this environment provides a solid foundation for your work.
Want to try it yourself? The complete script is available on GitHub at AI with Mac.

English Dominance in AI Systems Leaves Other Languages Behind
Artificial intelligence systems aren't just better at English - they're fundamentally English-centric technologies. From their initial training to their latest developments, from how they process prompts to how they "think" about problems, AI systems operate within an English-dominant framework that leaves other languages struggling to keep pace.
How artificial intelligence operates as an English-first technology, with German dialects revealing the depth of this challenge
This reality becomes apparent when examining how AI handles German and its various regional forms. German serves as a case study not because it's uniquely challenging, but because its multiple variants reveal the different ways English dominance manifests across AI systems.
English Rules the Foundation
The numerical advantage English holds in AI training data tells only part of the story. Recent insights revealed that most large language models train on Common Crawl datasets where approximately 44% of content appears in English, while no other language exceeds 6%. This inequality shapes every aspect of how AI systems operate.
But the dominance runs much deeper than raw data volume. The reinforcement learning processes that fine-tune these models are overwhelmingly conducted in English. The human feedback that shapes AI behavior comes primarily from English-speaking evaluators. The safety guidelines, ethical frameworks, and behavioral instructions that govern AI responses are developed and tested primarily in English contexts. AI systems don't just perform better in English; they fundamentally operate according to English linguistic and cultural logic.
English Thinking Patterns Dominate AI Processing
When AI systems process non-English prompts, they often translate concepts into English frameworks before generating responses. This creates a peculiar situation where a German speaker asking about Austrian cuisine might receive an answer that reflects English cultural assumptions about food presentation and dining customs, even when delivered in grammatically correct German.
Consider how AI handles the German Du/Sie distinction - the choice between informal and formal "you." This decision requires understanding social hierarchies, professional contexts, regional differences, and situational dynamics. Yet AI systems consistently default to formality across German interactions, revealing how English politeness norms (which lack this formal/informal distinction) shape responses even in other languages.
A German speaker recently observed that "AI's German, at least for frontier models, has gotten surprisingly good, but a bit stilted." The "stilted" quality is not just about language mechanics - it reflects AI thinking patterns trained primarily on English social and cultural contexts.
New Developments Emerge in English First
The most advanced AI capabilities consistently debut in English before being adapted to other languages. Complex reasoning tasks, creative writing features, technical documentation assistance, and specialized domain knowledge all receive English-first development cycles.
This English-first approach extends even to the most sophisticated prompting techniques. Recent documentation from Anthropic reveals that their Claude Code system responds to specific English trigger words that allocate different levels of computational "thinking budget." Words like "think," "think hard," "think harder," and "ultrathink" map to progressively larger token allowances - 4,000, 10,000, and 31,999 tokens respectively. These advanced prompting capabilities are designed around English phrases, with no equivalent triggers documented for other languages.
The code analysis reveals other English prompting variants: "think intensely," "think longer," "think really hard," "think super hard," "think very hard," and "megathink" all activate enhanced processing modes. This sophisticated prompting vocabulary exists exclusively in English, giving English-speaking users access to AI capabilities that simply don't exist for speakers of other languages.
This pattern means that by the time advanced capabilities reach other languages, they're essentially translations of English-designed features rather than native implementations. A German user accessing advanced AI assistance receives tools conceptualized around English paragraph structures, sentence rhythms, and rhetorical patterns - then adapted to German grammar rules.
English Prompting Produces Superior Results
Users worldwide discover that prompting AI systems in English yields more sophisticated, nuanced, and reliable responses than using their native languages. This creates a practical English-first usage pattern, even among multilingual users who would prefer to interact in their native tongues.
The advanced prompting techniques available in English - like the "ultrathink" capabilities - simply don't exist in other languages. A German speaker wanting to access maximum AI reasoning power must either use English prompts or miss out on these enhanced capabilities entirely. This technical reality forces even native German speakers to become English prompters when they need AI systems to perform at their highest levels.
A Swiss banker friend recently told me, "I speak Swiss German with my family, High German with my German clients, and English with my AI assistant." This pragmatic approach reflects a broader reality: English has become the lingua franca of AI interaction not by linguistic merit but by technological necessity.
The prompting advantage manifests in several ways. English prompts can access more sophisticated reasoning capabilities, reference broader knowledge bases, receive more contextually appropriate responses, and now trigger enhanced computational modes unavailable in other languages. Technical questions, creative requests, and complex analytical tasks all perform better when framed in English, regardless of the user's native language or the subject matter's cultural context.
German Dialects Reveal the Depth of English Dominance
German's multiple variants provide a clear window into how English dominance affects different types of linguistic challenges.
Standard German shows what happens when AI encounters a well-documented, formally structured non-English language. Despite substantial progress, AI produces that characteristic "stilted" quality that native speakers immediately recognize. The grammar may be correct, but the cultural fluency remains absent because the underlying thinking patterns follow English norms. German speakers cannot access "ultrathink" capabilities by saying "ultradenken" - the enhanced reasoning modes remain locked behind English terminology.
Austrian German reveals how regional variants compound the English-dominance problem. When a colleague asked an AI assistant about traditional Austrian dishes, it knew about Wiener Schnitzel but looked confused when she mentioned Erdäpfelsalat until she explained it's potato salad with an Austrian name. The AI could handle the internationally known reference but struggled with locally specific terminology that hadn't been filtered through English-language sources.
Swiss German dialects represent the extreme end of this challenge. These primarily oral languages with inconsistent written standards and limited digital footprints become nearly incomprehensible to AI systems designed around English linguistic assumptions. During a recent trip to Zürich, I witnessed how even advanced AI systems completely failed with messages like "Grüezi mitenand! Häsch du en Momänt?" No amount of enhanced thinking budget helps when the fundamental linguistic patterns lie outside the English-trained framework.
The Broader Multilingual Reality
These German examples illustrate patterns that extend across languages worldwide. Languages with rich dialectal variations - Arabic, Chinese, Spanish - face similar challenges. Languages with limited digital footprints struggle with basic recognition. Languages with complex cultural contexts generate the same artificially formal outputs that characterize AI's German interactions.
The English-first development cycle means that features designed for English-speaking users get adapted to other languages rather than being conceived multilingually from the start. Advanced prompting techniques, enhanced reasoning modes, and sophisticated interaction capabilities all emerge in English first - if they reach other languages at all.
Professional Implications of English Dominance
In professional settings, this English-first reality creates practical challenges for multilingual organizations. Native speakers across languages consistently report needing to correct AI-generated content that, while grammatically accurate, sounds artificial or culturally inappropriate.
The solution many professionals adopt mirrors the Swiss banker's approach: use English for AI interactions, then translate or adapt the results for local contexts. This workaround acknowledges the technological reality while highlighting the additional burden placed on non-English speakers in AI-enabled workflows.
When advanced AI capabilities require specific English prompting techniques - like the "ultrathink" commands - this burden becomes even more pronounced. Non-English speakers must not only switch languages to access AI systems but also master English-specific prompting vocabularies to access the most powerful features.
The Path Forward Requires Fundamental Change
Improving AI's multilingual capabilities requires more than adding training data in other languages. The English-centric thinking patterns, development cycles, evaluation frameworks, and prompting architectures need fundamental reconsideration. True multilingual AI would be designed from the ground up to think multilingually, with advanced features accessible through native-language commands rather than English-only triggers.
German's multiple variants provide a compelling illustration of both the challenge and the opportunity. From the stilted formality of standard German interactions to the complete bewilderment of Swiss dialects, from the lack of native advanced prompting techniques to the necessity of English-language interaction for maximum capability, we see the full spectrum of what happens when English-dominant AI systems encounter linguistic diversity.
Understanding this English-first reality helps users make informed decisions about how to interact with AI systems effectively while highlighting the substantial work still needed to create AI that truly serves global linguistic diversity rather than simply accommodating it as an afterthought to English-optimized capabilities.

The Digital Language Caste System - How AI Creates Linguistic Apartheid
How artificial intelligence systems are creating a digital hierarchy based on language – and why this transformation is happening faster than most realize
The increasing integration of AI is creating a digital hierarchy based on language. If advanced AI systems primarily support a few languages, speakers of less represented languages will be disadvantaged in accessing crucial information like healthcare, education, and government services. This linguistic bias in AI could worsen existing societal inequalities, impacting economic opportunity and digital representation for marginalized linguistic communities in a globalized, digitally driven world.
A troubling pattern has emerged in homes around the world. Children speak their grandmother's language at Sunday dinner, use their country's official language for schoolwork, and switch to English when they need serious help from AI.
This is the three-language division.
This shift reveals how digital tools are quietly creating a new kind of social stratification where your native language determines which technological capabilities you can actually access. Previous waves of language loss unfolded over generations. This one happens during a single childhood, shaped by millions of daily conversations with machines that think primarily in English.
We're watching the foundation of linguistic extinction get built directly into artificial intelligence systems. Most people haven't noticed it's happening.
The Real Numbers Behind Digital Language Death
Consider what these statistics actually represent: Over 4 billion people worldwide speak languages that AI systems treat as inferior options.
The breakdown reveals the scope:
44% of AI training data comes from English sources – though English speakers make up just 15% of humanity
More than 7,000 languages exist globally – but fewer than 100 receive decent AI support
By 2030, most internet users will interact with AI regularly – making this language gap a daily reality
Children born today will grow up assuming that complex thinking requires English fluency
These numbers tell only part of the story. The human transformation happening in families worldwide reveals the deeper implications.
When Smart Kids Choose the Machine's Language
Reports from multilingual households show a concerning trend: children increasingly ask AI systems their hardest questions in English – not because their homework requires English, but because they learned the responses work better that way.
Educational researchers document this pattern across continents. Teenagers in Seoul switch to English for AI tutoring even when completing Korean assignments. Students in Barcelona default to English for AI help with Spanish literature projects. Berlin families watch their children struggle to explain technical concepts in German while remaining perfectly fluent in everyday conversation.
We're raising the first generation that unconsciously links intellectual sophistication with English – not because they prefer American culture, but because their digital tools work better that way.
Iceland's Warning: When AI Accelerates Existing Language Loss
Iceland shows what happens when AI amplifies linguistic shifts that are already in motion.
Young Icelanders were already switching between languages before AI arrived - English for peer conversations influenced by international media, Icelandic for family interactions. Films, books, television, and social media had created a generation comfortable operating in both linguistic worlds.
AI didn't create this pattern. It made it functionally necessary.
Now those same young people who casually spoke English with friends find themselves needing English for complex digital tasks. What started as cultural preference has become technological requirement.
The country still has done everything right for language preservation:
Government policies require Icelandic terms for all new technology
Cultural pride makes linguistic preservation a national obsession
Strong institutions support Icelandic in schools and media
Yet researchers report young Icelanders now feel "linguistically trapped" - not just preferring English for certain social contexts, but requiring it for intellectual advancement through AI tools.
If Iceland - with every possible advantage and an existing bilingual generation - can't prevent AI from making English functionally superior for complex thinking, what happens to languages without that head start?
Germany faces all of Iceland's challenges plus additional complications: greater cultural diversity, stronger economic pressures toward English, wider AI quality gaps, and regional dialects that fragment the linguistic community.
The Hidden Command Structure That Locks Out Non-English Speakers
Here's where digital linguistic apartheid becomes impossible to ignore: AI systems' most powerful capabilities get unlocked through English-only commands.
Technical documentation reveals that advanced AI systems respond to specific English phrases that trigger different levels of computational power:
"think" → allocates 4,000 processing tokens
"think hard" → allocates 10,000 tokens
"ultrathink" → allocates 31,999 tokens
Other English variations unlock enhanced processing: "think intensely," "megathink," "think super hard" – each calibrated to activate different levels of machine reasoning.
This sophisticated command vocabulary exists only in English. German speakers can't access maximum AI reasoning by saying "ultradenken." French speakers can't unlock advanced capabilities with "pensez très fort."
The technical architecture forces even native German speakers to become English prompters when they need AI systems at full capacity. It's computational colonialism written into the code.
Three Ways Languages Die in the Digital Age
Type 1: Technical Strangulation (Swiss German Dialects)
Languages that exist primarily in spoken form, with inconsistent written standards, become completely invisible to AI systems. Advanced AI fails entirely with messages like "Grüezi mitenand! Häsch du en Momänt?" (Hello everyone! Do you have a moment?)
No amount of enhanced processing power helps when fundamental language patterns fall outside English-trained frameworks.
Type 2: Cultural Hollowing (Standard German)
Despite technical progress, AI produces responses that native speakers immediately recognize as artificial. The grammar works, but cultural understanding remains absent because underlying thought patterns follow English norms.
German speakers consistently describe AI-generated business emails as sounding like "a well-educated foreign intern who learned German from textbooks but never lived here."
Type 3: Professional Displacement (Austrian German)
Regional knowledge gets lost when AI training focuses on internationally known references rather than locally embedded information. AI assistants recognize Wiener Schnitzel but need explanation for Erdäpfelsalat (Austrian potato salad).
Local knowledge dies when it can't survive digital translation.
The Tokenization Trap That Creates Linguistic Hierarchy
Technical processing creates systematic disadvantages through seemingly mundane decisions. When AI breaks human language into processing units called "tokens," it builds in linguistic hierarchy:
English: "main train station" (3 clean tokens)
German: "Hauptbahnhof" (complex compound requiring algorithmic splitting)
Swiss German: "Houptbaanhof" (non-standard spelling, minimal training data)
German compound words like "Bundestagswahlkampffinanzierung" (federal election campaign financing) require sophisticated splitting algorithms that English rarely needs. When AI systems learn primarily from English's space-separated patterns, they apply inappropriate processing strategies to other languages.
Complex Linguistics + Scarce Data = Exponentially Harder Processing
The Economics of Linguistic Inequality
This cultural loss creates economic stratification:
German businesses pay higher costs for AI implementation
Innovation concentrates in English-speaking regions
Competitive disadvantages emerge for companies in AI-dependent industries
Brain drain accelerates toward English-dominant technology centers
The three-language approach becomes economically rational: English for AI efficiency, local languages for cultural connection.
Proof That Different Choices Are Possible
Some organizations are fighting back successfully, proving the current trajectory isn't inevitable:
DeepL https://www.deepl.com/en/translator has demonstrated that high-quality, culturally aware translation between European languages is technically achievable, though they focus on translation rather than native-language AI reasoning.
The University of Helsinki https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/organisations/finnish-center-for-artificial-intelligence-fcai is developing language-specific AI models for Finnish that maintain cultural context while achieving technical performance comparable to English systems – though this requires massive dedicated resources.
Mozilla Common Voice https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets has collected speech data in over 100 languages, creating foundations for voice AI that doesn't default to English patterns. It's still a limited subset, but shows a possible route.
These examples prove the technical barriers aren't insurmountable – they're choices embedded in current development priorities.
Three Possible Futures
Future 1: Digital Apartheid (Current Trajectory) English becomes the only language for complex AI interaction. Other languages survive in diminished, ceremonial roles. The three-language division becomes humanity's permanent structure.
Future 2: Linguistic Hierarchy (Probable Outcome)A ranking system emerges where language determines digital capability. High-resource languages achieve decent but inferior AI performance. Most people switch languages based on task complexity. Cultural diversity survives but becomes functionally limited.
Future 3: True Digital Multilingualism (Requires Immediate Action) AI systems get redesigned from the ground up to think multilingually. Advanced features become accessible through native-language commands. Computational architecture respects linguistic diversity as a design principle, not an afterthought.
We have roughly 5-7 years before current trends become permanent institutional patterns.
What You Can Do Starting Today
If you speak a non-English language:
Use your native language for complex AI tasks, even when English would work better, then document and report AI quality differences you experience
Support companies developing multilingual AI capabilities with your purchasing decisions
Encourage children to maintain intellectual engagement in their heritage language
If you work in technology:
Advocate for multilingual AI development in your organization
Invest in or support startups tackling this challenge
Include language accessibility in product requirements
Push back against English-only defaults in AI tool development
If you're in education or policy:
Require AI systems used in schools to support native languages at the same level as English
Fund research into multilingual AI architecture
Create policies protecting linguistic diversity in digital spaces
Support teacher training for multilingual AI literacy
If you care about cultural preservation:
Recognize that daily language choices with AI systems shape humanity's linguistic future
Share observations about AI language quality differences to raise awareness
Support cultural institutions adapting to multilingual AI challenges
The Decision Point Is Now
Note that we are designing the relationship between human cultures and digital capability for the next century.
The technical complexity of German word processing, the English-only advanced command requirements, and the artificial quality of non-English AI interactions aren't temporary problems waiting for eventual fixes. They're built-in features of systems designed with English-first assumptions.
The children making language choices today will determine whether linguistic diversity survives the AI revolution. The three-language division – heritage language for family, standard language for work, English for AI – represents either a practical compromise or the death of meaningful multilingualism.
Without decisive action in the next few years, we risk trading thousands of years of cultural heritage for the computational convenience of English dominance.
The question isn't whether AI will transform languages – that's already happening. The question is whether we'll guide this transformation to preserve human linguistic diversity, or let algorithmic efficiency choose humanity's cultural future.
The last generation to grow up truly multilingual may already be in elementary school. Their decisions about AI and language will echo through centuries.

The Tokenization Trap - How AI Actually Processes German
Today we're going under the hood to see what happens when AI processes German text. The discovery might shock you: the problem goes beyond having less German training data. It's about fundamental computational approaches built around English assumptions.
Part 2 - Opening the black box to see exactly why German creates computational nightmares for AI systems
In Part 1 , we explored whether lesser-served languages face extinction in our AI-dominated future. We discussed English dominance, cultural implications, and that Swiss banker who switches languages depending on context. But to understand why AI systems struggle with German - and why linguistic inequality keeps growing - we need to crack open the technical black box.
The Moment of Truth - Watching AI Tokenize German
Here's a real example that shows the challenge perfectly:
German: "Die Bundesregierung entwickelte neue Datenschutzbestimmungen für Krankenversicherungsunternehmen."
English: "The federal government developed new data protection regulations for health insurance companies."
Both sentences express the same concept. But watch what happens when AI breaks them into tokens - the fundamental units that neural networks process.
Round 1 - Naive Word-Level Tokenization
If we simply split on spaces (what early systems might do):
German tokens: ["Die", "Bundesregierung", "entwickelte", "neue", "Datenschutzbestimmungen", "für", "Krankenversicherungsunternehmen"]
Token count: 7
English tokens: ["The", "federal", "government", "developed", "new", "data", "protection", "regulations", "for", "health", "insurance", "companies"]
Token count: 12
See the problem? German appears "simpler" with fewer tokens, but those tokens are monsters. "Krankenversicherungsunternehmen" packs 31 characters of meaning that AI must understand as a single unit.
Think of it as giving someone twelve Lego blocks versus seven welded-together mega-blocks. The German mega-blocks contain the same information, but they're much harder to work with computationally.
Round 2 - Modern Subword Tokenization
Today's AI systems use sophisticated approaches like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece tokenization that split compounds:
German subword tokens: ["Die", "Bundes", "##regierung", "entwickel", "##te", "neue", "Daten", "##schutz", "##bestimmungen", "für", "Kranken", "##versicherungs", "##unternehmen", "##."]
Token count: 14
English subword tokens: ["The", "federal", "government", "developed", "new", "data", "protection", "regulations", "for", "health", "insurance", "companies", "."]
Token count: 13
The ## prefix marks subword pieces that continue a word. This helps AI handle German compounds but creates new challenges: the system must learn that "Kranken + ##versicherungs + ##unternehmen" forms one concept, while English presents "health insurance companies" as naturally separate, learnable units.
The Compound Word Nightmare
To grasp how extreme this gets, consider a word that's normal in German but computationally terrifying:
Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapitän
Length: 42 characters
Meaning: "Danube steamship company captain"
Breakdown: Donau + dampf + schiff + fahrt + gesellschaft + kapitän
English equivalent: 4 simple, separate words
When AI encounters this word, it must learn to split it meaningfully. But here's the catch: AI trained on English expects spaces to mark word boundaries. They've learned "captain" and "company" as separate concepts because English always presents them separately.
German throws this assumption out the window. The AI must develop compound-splitting algorithms, morphological analysis, and semantic decomposition capabilities - all to handle what English achieves with simple spaces.
But Wait - What About Disestablishmentarianism?
"Hold on," you might say, "English has long words too! What about 'disestablishmentarianism' or 'pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis'?"
True, but there's a crucial difference. English long words are:
Rare exceptions - You'll never see them in everyday text
Academic or medical terms - Confined to specialist domains
Single concepts - Not productive compounds you can create on the fly
Already tokenized - AI systems have seen these specific words and learned them as units
German compound formation is:
Productive - Germans create new compounds daily that AI has never seen
Common - Even children use words like "Geburtstagsgeschenk" (birthday present)
Unpredictable - You can't pre-train on all possible combinations
Context-dependent - The same components combine differently based on meaning
The difference? English has a few dozen monster words that AI can memorise. German has an infinite generative system that creates new monsters every day. It's like the difference between learning a list of exceptions versus learning an entire grammatical system.
Yes, English Has Compounds Too - But There's a Catch
"What about 'toothbrush', 'football', or 'bookshelf'?" you might ask. "English creates compounds too!"
Absolutely right. But English compounds behave differently in ways that matter for AI:
English compounds:
Often lexicalised (frozen into dictionary words)
Limited to 2-3 components usually
Frequently written as separate words ("coffee table", "washing machine")
Meaning often shifts from literal ("butterfly" isn't a flying butter)
Can't freely combine ("tooth brush" works, but "teeth brush" doesn't)
German compounds:
Freely productive (create new ones spontaneously)
Can chain 4, 5, 6+ components
Always written as single words
Meaning stays compositional and predictable
Components inflect and modify ("Zähne" + "bürste" = "Zahnbürste")
Consider this escalation:
English: "toothbrush" → "electric toothbrush" → "electric toothbrush holder"
German: "Zahnbürste" → "Elektrozahnbürste" → "Elektrozahnbürstenhalter" → "Elektrozahnbürstenhalterherstellungsanleitung"
English breaks into spaces. German keeps building. AI trained on English expects those helpful spaces - when German denies them, the computational challenge explodes.
The Morphological Maze
German doesn't just create compounds - it changes word forms based on grammatical context. Consider this tokenization nightmare:
der Hund → "the dog" (nominative case)
des Hundes → "of the dog" (genitive case)
dem Hund → "to the dog" (dative case)
den Hund → "the dog" (accusative case)
AI must learn these four different token sequences all refer to the same concept: a dog. English presents "the dog" consistently, making relationships easier to learn.
Multiply this by every noun, adjective, and article in German, and you get vocabulary explosion that English avoids.
Not Just German - The Broader Pattern
That viral meme comparing "the" across languages captures the problem perfectly. While English speakers calmly use one word - "THE" - for every situation, other languages create computational chaos:
French requires choosing between:
Singular: le, la, l'
Plural: les
Italian doubles down with:
Singular: il, lo, la, l'
Plural: i, gli, le
German goes full nightmare mode:
Nominative: der, die, das, die
Accusative: den, die, das, die
Dative: dem, der, dem, den
Genitive: des, der, des, der
This isn't just about articles. The same pattern repeats across each language's entire grammatical system. Where English uses position and helper words to convey meaning, these languages encode information directly into word forms.
For AI systems, this means:
French text requires 4x the article variations
Italian needs 7x the variations
German demands 16x the variations
Each variation needs separate training examples. Each form creates another token pattern to learn. Each grammatical rule multiplies the computational complexity.
The meme's angry French and Italian speakers, the shocked German learner, and the serene English cat perfectly capture the computational reality: English's simplicity isn't just easier for humans to learn - it's exponentially easier for AI to process.
The Separable Verb Catastrophe
Perhaps German's most computationally challenging feature is separable verbs - where word meaning scatters across entire sentences.
Example: "Ich rufe dich heute an" (I call you today) Tokens: ["Ich", "rufe", "dich", "heute", "an"]
The verb "anrufen" (to call) splits into "rufe" and "an," separated by three other words. AI must learn tokens 2 and 5 form a semantic unit, while tokens 1, 3, and 4 are separate concepts.
Compare this to English: "I call you today" Tokens: ["I", "call", "you", "today"]
Every token represents a complete concept, and relationships stay linear. No computational gymnastics needed.
A More Extreme Example
Let's push limits with a sentence that's reasonable in German but computationally nightmarish:
German: "Der Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapitän rief seinen Krankenversicherungsvertreter wegen der Datenschutzgrundverordnungsimplementierung an."
English: "The Danube steamship company captain called his health insurance representative regarding the data protection regulation implementation."
German tokenization (21 tokens): ["Der", "Donau", "##dampf", "##schiff", "##fahrt", "##gesellschaft", "##kapitän", "rief", "seinen", "Kranken", "##versicherungs", "##vertreter", "wegen", "der", "Daten", "##schutz", "##grund", "##verordnung", "##implementierung", "an", "##."]
English tokenization (17 tokens): ["The", "Danube", "steamship", "company", "captain", "called", "his", "health", "insurance", "representative", "regarding", "the", "data", "protection", "regulation", "implementation", "."]
German needs more tokens despite expressing identical meaning, and many tokens are fragments (marked ##) requiring computational reassembly.
Why This Breaks AI Systems
When English-trained AI encounters German, several things fail:
1. Inappropriate Tokenization Strategies The system applies space-based assumptions to compound-heavy German, missing semantic relationships that proper compound splitting would reveal.
2. Vocabulary Explosion German's morphological richness creates exponentially more word variants than English, demanding much more training data for equal coverage.
3. Non-Linear Relationships Separable verbs force AI to learn that meaning can scatter across sentences - something English rarely requires.
4. Computational Overhead German needs sophisticated preprocessing - compound splitting, morphological analysis, case normalisation - that English often skips.
5. Pattern Interference English-learned patterns actively interfere with German processing, like applying hammer techniques to screwdriver problems.
The Training Data Amplification Effect
Remember from Part 1 that English dominates AI training data (roughly 44% versus 2-3% for German). This imbalance doesn't just mean less German exposure - it means computational patterns optimised for English actively work against German's linguistic structure.
When AI sees "health insurance companies" as separate tokens millions of times, but "Krankenversicherungsunternehmen" as a compound only thousands of times, English patterns dominate. Limited German examples can't overcome the overwhelming English tokenization logic embedded in neural networks.
This explains why German AI output often sounds stilted even when grammatically correct - the underlying processing patterns were optimised for English structures.
Real-World Consequences
These technical challenges create immediate practical impacts.
For German Speakers:
Need more explicit, formal language for good AI results
Miss advanced prompting techniques locked behind English commands
Face higher error rates in AI-assisted tasks
Experience cultural mismatches in AI-generated content
For German Businesses:
Higher costs for AI implementation and maintenance
Need specialised German AI tooling
Competitive disadvantages in AI-dependent industries
Greater reliance on English for AI-powered workflows
For German Culture:
Technical bias toward formal, "textbook" German
Loss of regional expressions and dialectal richness
Pressure to use English for complex AI interactions
Gradual erosion of German's role in technical domains
Three Paths Forward
Understanding these technical challenges clarifies our options:
Path 1 - Accept English Dominance Continue using English for complex AI tasks while relegating German to basic interactions. Computationally easiest but culturally devastating.
Path 2 - Incremental Improvement Develop better German-specific tokenization, compound splitting, and morphological handling. This helps but doesn't address fundamental data imbalance.
Path 3 - Architectural Revolution Design AI systems from scratch to handle linguistic diversity natively, rather than adapting English-optimised architectures to other languages.
What This Means for the Future
The tokenization challenges we've examined aren't technical curiosities - they're the computational foundation of linguistic inequality in AI systems.
Every time AI struggles to split "Krankenversicherungsunternehmen" properly, misses connections between "rufe" and "an," or produces stilted German because it thinks in English patterns - we witness technical mechanisms that could marginalise non-English languages.
The Swiss banker speaking "English with his AI assistant" isn't making a cultural choice - he's making a computational one.
The question from Part 1 remains: Are lesser-served languages doomed? Now you see the technical gears grinding toward that outcome. German's computational challenges, multiplied by English data dominance, multiplied by architectural choices optimised for English patterns, create technological momentum that's hard to reverse.
But understanding these mechanisms reveals intervention points. Better compound splitting algorithms, multilingual training approaches, and architectural designs that respect linguistic diversity could change the trajectory.
The choice stands before us: engineer AI systems that serve linguistic diversity, or watch computational convenience steamroll centuries of cultural heritage.
The tokens are being counted. The patterns are being learned. The future gets coded one subword at a time.

The "No Elephants" Problem - Why AI Struggles With What NOT to Do
Imagine asking an artist to "draw a picture with no elephants" - simple enough, right?
When AI Can't Take No for an Answer
You'd expect a landscape, a portrait, a still life - anything except pachyderms. But when you give this same instruction to an AI image generator, you might find yourself staring at a parade of elephants marching across your screen.
This goes beyond a quirky bug or isolated glitch. This window into AI limitations shows something fascinating: these systems are remarkably bad at understanding "no."
The elephant example might seem amusing, but this negation problem extends far beyond any single concept. Try asking an AI to write a story without mentioning love - watch romance bloom on every page. Generate code without using loops? Prepare for while statements galore. Create a logo without blue elements? Hello, azure designs. Design a room with no furniture? Behold, the fully furnished space.
This pattern emerges consistently across different types of AI-generated content, from text to images to code. These systems aren't rebellious or contrary - they're revealing something fundamental about how they understand and process language.
The Training Data Dilemma
To understand why negation trips up AI systems, we need to peek under the hood at how these models learn and operate.
Most AI training data describes what exists, not what doesn't. Think about image captions: they typically say "a photo of a dog in a park" rather than "a photo with no cats, no elephants, and no spaceships." This creates a massive imbalance where models learn strong associations between concepts and their presence, but struggle with absence.
When processing "draw a picture with no elephants," AI attention mechanisms often laser-focus on the most salient noun: "elephants." The word "no" gets overshadowed by the vivid concept it's supposed to negate. Think of the classic psychology trick - when someone says "don't think of a pink elephant," that's exactly what pops into your mind.
These models are essentially sophisticated pattern-matching systems. In their training experience, when "elephants" appears in a prompt, it's almost always because elephants should appear in the output. The statistical correlation overwhelms negation words, drowning them out in the noise.
Perhaps most importantly, current AI systems lack what we might call a "constraint checking" mechanism. Humans can generate an initial response and then consciously review it against the original instruction. If I asked you to describe your morning routine without mentioning coffee, you might start thinking about your cup of joe, but then catch yourself and pivot to other details. Most AI systems don't have this secondary checking process.
The Spectrum of Negation
The negation problem varies across different types of negative language. Understanding this spectrum reveals just how nuanced these challenges can be.
LLMs handle prefix negations like "uncomfortable," "impossible," or "dislike" quite well. Why? Because these aren't processed as negation instructions - they're learned vocabulary. When an AI encounters "uncomfortable," it doesn't compute "un" + "comfortable" on the fly. Instead, "uncomfortable" exists as its own semantic concept in the model's learned representations, complete with associations, contexts, and meanings developed through thousands of training examples.
This difference between vocabulary negation (using words that happen to contain negative prefixes) and instruction negation (being told to avoid or exclude something) proves crucial.
But what happens when we combine these? Consider "not uncomfortable" - this creates a fascinating middle ground that often trips up AI systems in subtle ways. The phrase should logically resolve to "comfortable" or "at ease." But LLMs frequently stumble because they're dealing with a well-learned vocabulary item, an instruction-level negation applied to it, and the need to perform logical resolution.
Modal negation creates yet another layer of complexity. Consider these examples where "can't" instructions often backfire: Write about a bird that can't fly, and you get vivid descriptions of soaring and aerial acrobatics. Design a phone that can't make calls, and you'll see detailed calling features and contact management systems.
Modal negation combines two complex concepts: the modal logic of capability with instruction negation. When processing "can't fly," the AI's attention often locks onto "fly" as the central concept, treating it as something to elaborate on rather than avoid.
What This Reveals About AI
The negation problem illuminates something profound about how current AI systems work. They're fundamentally additive - trained to build up content by combining learned patterns and associations. They excel at synthesis and generation but struggle with subtraction and exclusion.
This reflects their training paradigm rather than a flaw. These systems have become incredibly sophisticated at understanding "what goes together" but haven't developed strong mechanisms for "what should be kept apart."
Double negatives reveal that LLMs struggle with what we might call "logical algebra" - the step-by-step reasoning required to resolve negative × negative = positive. They're pattern-matching systems that excel at recognising linguistic structures they've seen before, but they're still developing the ability to perform multi-step logical inference on the fly.
Practical Workarounds
While the negation problem persists, some techniques can help navigate around it.
Positive framing works wonders. Instead of "no elephants," try "draw a peaceful mountain landscape with trees and a lake." Guide the AI toward what you want rather than away from what you don't.
When constraints matter, embed them within positive context. Rather than "Create a meal plan with no dairy," try "Create a plant-based meal plan featuring fresh vegetables, legumes, and whole grains." This approach gives the AI a clear roadmap to follow, rather than asking it to navigate around invisible barriers.
For complex tasks, break instructions into clear, sequential steps. Define the goal, specify elements, set the style, and add constraints naturally. This multi-step guidance works because it plays to AI strengths - pattern recognition and replication.
Sometimes showing beats restricting. Instead of "Don't make this sound corporate," try "Write in a conversational tone, like you're explaining this to a friend over coffee." When you provide clear, positive examples of what you want, you're working with AI strengths rather than against their limitations.
The Road Ahead
As AI systems advance, addressing the negation problem will likely require fundamental changes in how these models understand and process constraints. This might involve training datasets that explicitly include negation examples, new architectures that can perform constraint checking, multi-step reasoning systems that can review and revise outputs, or better integration of symbolic reasoning with neural approaches.
The "no elephants" problem might seem like a technical curiosity, but it highlights an important reality about our current AI systems. They're incredibly powerful at generation and synthesis, but they're still learning the subtle art of restraint.
Understanding these limitations helps us use AI tools more effectively and sets realistic expectations for what they can and cannot do. The next time you're working with an AI system and find yourself staring at exactly what you asked it not to create, remember: you're not dealing with a stubborn assistant, but with a system that's still learning the complex human concept of "no."
Perhaps the most remarkable thing isn't that AI struggles with negation, but that humans - with our ability to consciously override our initial impulses and check our work against constraints - make it look so effortless.

You Built Software for Humans - Now Build It for AI
Software that works brilliantly for humans often confuses AI assistants completely - and that's becoming a serious business problem.
When Intelligent Systems Meet Unintelligent Architecture
Picture this: Your AI assistant promises to help debug your application. You share your codebase. It stares back helplessly - lost in your elegant abstractions, confused by your sophisticated architecture, blind to the very patterns that make your software maintainable for humans.
This scenario highlights a fundamental shift happening in software development. We spent decades optimising for human cognition, creating abstractions and patterns that help us manage complexity. Now we need systems that AI can understand, navigate, and improve.
The challenge goes beyond documentation or API design. We're facing an architectural reckoning - our most sophisticated systems often prove most opaque to AI assistance.
The Human-Centric Legacy
Traditional software architecture prioritises human developers through familiar patterns:
Deep hierarchical structures that mirror how we organise thoughts. Nested components, recursive patterns, and layered abstractions that feel intuitive to human minds navigating codebases.
Flexible primitives like files, folders, and modules with meanings derived from context rather than semantics. A "component" folder could contain anything - the structure depends on human understanding of conventions.
Sophisticated build processes that bundle, minify, and optimise code for performance. The result works beautifully for users but creates black boxes that hide implementation details from AI analysis.
Rich IDE integration with intelligent autocomplete, refactoring tools, and debugging capabilities that enhance human productivity while remaining invisible to external AI systems.
These patterns serve human developers well. We think hierarchically, understand implicit context, and navigate complex abstractions naturally. But AI assistants approach software differently.
Why AI Struggles with Human-Optimised Systems
AI assistants face fundamental limitations when working with traditional architectures:
Context window constraints mean they can't hold entire codebases in memory. Deep nesting and recursive structures overwhelm their ability to maintain architectural understanding across complex systems.
Semantic blindness to implicit conventions. Where humans understand that a "utils" folder contains helper functions, AI sees only arbitrary naming without inherent meaning.
Opacity of build processes creates insurmountable barriers. When your source code gets transformed through multiple build steps, AI can't connect runtime behaviour with the code you're actually writing.
Fragmented development environments scatter information across multiple tools and systems. AI can't integrate insights from your IDE, version control, deployment pipeline, and documentation simultaneously.
The result? AI assistance remains shallow - limited to basic code completion rather than architectural guidance, system-wide refactoring, or meaningful debugging support.
The Runtime Debugging Trap
Here's the most insidious problem in AI-assisted development: AI naturally debugs what it can see, not what it should modify.
In modern development environments, the code AI observes at runtime often bears little resemblance to the source code you actually write. Templates become components. Configuration generates routes. Schemas produce database models. Build processes transform everything.
When issues arise, AI gravitates toward debugging the runtime code - it's visible, it's where problems manifest, and it often looks like regular source code. But this creates a devastating failure mode: AI makes suggestions that technically work and might even fix the immediate issue, but they vanish on the next deployment.
Consider a typical debugging session:
AI spots a bug in a generated component file
AI suggests a fix that resolves the runtime issue
Developer applies the fix - problem disappears
Next deployment regenerates the component from source templates
Bug returns, fix is gone, confusion ensues
This cycle wastes enormous development time because teams apply "fixes" that aren't actually fixes. The problem compounds with every transformation layer - templates to components to bundles to runtime creates multiple opportunities for AI to chase shadows in generated code.
The fundamental issue: AI needs to understand not just what files exist, but which files matter for which purposes and how they relate through your transformation pipeline. Without this understanding, AI debugging becomes counterproductive.
The AI-First Architecture Shift
Forward-thinking development teams are rethinking software architecture for AI collaboration. This doesn't mean abandoning good engineering practices - it means making those practices visible and understandable to AI systems.
Semantic structure over arbitrary organisation. Instead of generic folders, use naming conventions that encode meaning. A user-authentication directory communicates purpose; a auth folder requires human interpretation.
Transparent build processes that maintain traceability between source and runtime code. When AI can connect what you write with what actually executes, it provides meaningful assistance with debugging and optimisation.
Unified development environments that consolidate information in AI-accessible formats. Rather than scattering configuration across multiple tools, centralise context in ways that AI can discover and understand.
Flat information hierarchies that reduce cognitive load for both humans and AI. Deep nesting might feel organised, but it creates navigation challenges for systems with limited context windows.
Practical Patterns for AI Collaboration
Several architectural patterns enable meaningful AI assistance:
Self-documenting code structures where the file system itself communicates intent. Directory names that describe functionality, file names that indicate purpose, and organisation that reflects the actual data flow through your system.
Zero-dependency debugging where AI can understand your system without external tools. When problems occur, AI should be able to analyse your code directly rather than requiring specialised debugging environments.
Explicit configuration management that makes system behaviour transparent. Instead of implicit defaults buried in framework conventions, make choices visible in configuration files that AI can read and understand.
Documentation architecture for AI consumption. Create dedicated documentation structures that AI can navigate effectively. This is not project-specific documentation like prd.md or claude.md files that define requirements or AI personas. Instead, this is framework and architecture-specific documentation that explains how your technical system actually works:
This separation allows you to optimise each documentation type for its intended audience - narrative explanations for humans, structured technical system knowledge for AI. The docs/for-ai folder focuses purely on architectural understanding, not project management or AI instruction.
Atomic development loops that enable rapid iteration. When AI suggests changes, the feedback cycle should be seconds, not minutes. Fast iteration helps AI bridge the gap between theoretical suggestions and working solutions.
Boundary definition for distributed systems. In composable architectures spanning multiple cloud services, AI needs explicit guidance about system boundaries and modification permissions:
Distributed debugging touch points. When your application flows across multiple cloud services, AI needs clear visibility into the debugging interfaces:
This explicit mapping teaches AI where it can gather debugging information without disrupting critical services.
Runtime transformation documentation. When your system generates or transforms code dynamically, AI needs explicit guidance about the transformation process. This directly addresses the runtime debugging trap by creating a clear map between source and runtime code:
This documentation prevents AI from falling into the runtime debugging trap - where it wastes time debugging generated code or making changes that disappear on the next build process. By explicitly documenting the transformation pipeline, AI can provide meaningful assistance at the correct layer of your architecture.
Beyond MCP - Comprehensive AI Integration
Model Context Protocol represents one approach to AI integration, but the opportunity extends much further:
Development environment integration where AI understands your entire workspace - not just individual files but the relationships between them, the deployment pipeline, and the runtime environment.
Real-time collaborative debugging where AI can observe system behaviour, analyse logs, and suggest fixes based on actual runtime data rather than static code analysis.
Architectural decision support where AI helps evaluate trade-offs, suggest refactoring opportunities, and identify potential issues before they impact users.
Automated testing generation that goes beyond unit tests to integration testing, performance validation, and user experience verification based on AI understanding of your complete system.
The Software Vendor Responsibility
This architectural shift requires action beyond individual development teams. Software manufacturers bear significant responsibility for enabling AI collaboration with their platforms and tools.
Building MCPs is just the beginning. While Model Context Protocol integration provides a foundation for AI interaction, vendors must go much further. Every framework, CMS platform, and development tool should include comprehensive AI integration documentation that explains system boundaries, transformation processes, and safe modification zones.
Documentation as a competitive advantage. The vendors that provide robust docs/for-ai/ packages alongside their software will see faster adoption and higher developer satisfaction. When your framework comes with explicit AI guidance about what files to modify, how builds transform code, and where debugging should focus, development teams can be productive immediately rather than spending weeks reverse-engineering your architecture.
Consider the difference: a framework that ships with only human-readable documentation versus one that includes AI-readable architectural maps, transformation guides, and explicit boundary definitions. The latter enables development teams to leverage AI assistance from day one, dramatically reducing the learning curve and time-to-productivity.
Software manufacturers who recognise this responsibility early will establish significant competitive advantages as AI-assisted development becomes the norm.
The Business Case for AI-Friendly Architecture
This architectural shift delivers immediate business value:
Faster development cycles when AI can provide meaningful assistance with complex tasks. Teams report productivity improvements when AI understands their systems well enough to suggest architectural improvements.
Improved code quality through AI-assisted code reviews that understand context beyond individual functions. AI can spot patterns, suggest optimisations, and identify potential issues across your entire codebase.
Reduced onboarding time for new team members. When AI can explain system architecture, trace data flows, and suggest next steps, new developers become productive faster.
Enhanced debugging capabilities where AI helps isolate issues, suggest fixes, and verify solutions across complex distributed systems.
Making the Transition
Transforming existing systems for AI collaboration requires strategic planning:
Start with new projects where you can apply AI-friendly patterns from the beginning. Use these as proving grounds for architectural approaches before retrofitting existing systems.
Focus on high-impact areas where AI assistance would provide the most value. Complex business logic, integration points, and performance-critical code often benefit most from AI collaboration.
Maintain backwards compatibility during transitions. AI-friendly architecture shouldn't break existing workflows or require massive rewrites of working systems.
Measure collaboration effectiveness by tracking how often AI provides useful suggestions, how quickly you can iterate on changes, and how much time you save on routine development tasks.
The Future of Development
Software development is becoming a collaborative process between human creativity and AI capability. The teams that succeed will be those who design systems that enhance both human understanding and AI assistance.
This doesn't mean sacrificing engineering best practices or building inferior software. The most AI-friendly architectures often prove more maintainable for humans too - transparency, explicit structure, and clear semantics benefit everyone involved in the development process.
Will your architecture be ready when AI will become central to software development?
The implications are profound. Traditional software architectures, often built on assumptions of human-centric coding, discrete deployment cycles, and predefined logic, may buckle under the demands of AI-driven development. Consider the need for architectures that can seamlessly integrate AI models, manage continuous learning loops, handle vast datasets for training and inference, and adapt to self-evolving codebases.
Preparing for this future requires a proactive approach. It necessitates a shift towards architectures that are inherently flexible, scalable, and intelligent. Think about microservices that can be autonomously developed and deployed by AI, serverless functions that scale instantly with AI-driven demand, and data pipelines optimized for continuous AI training. This readiness extends beyond technical specifications; it encompasses a cultural shift towards embracing AI as a co-creator, demanding new skill sets, and redefining collaboration within development teams.
The businesses that fail to anticipate and adapt their architectural strategies will find themselves at a severe disadvantage. Their development cycles will be slower, their innovations stifled, and their ability to compete in an AI-first world severely hampered. Conversely, those who strategically prepare their architectures will unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency, innovation, and responsiveness, positioning themselves at the forefront of the next era of software development. The time to assess and fortify your architecture is now, before the tide of AI-centric development irrevocably alters the landscape..

Behind the Curtain: How AI Models Think
The term "AI" is frequently used to describe technologies like Large Language Models. These models predict word sequences without true comprehension. This creates a misleading impression of human-like intelligence. The problem is further aggravated by companies using "AI" as a marketing buzzword, even when machine learning is minimally involved.
While interacting with AI language models, we typically only see the final responses. The internal processes that occur as the AI processes our questions remain hidden, especially when dealing with linguistic ambiguity, wordplay, or jokes. However, a series of conversations with two AI models—Phi-4 and Deepseek-r1:70b—provides a glimpse into these inner workings.
The Wordplay Challenge
The conversations centered around a clever linguistic trick that plays on the dual meaning of "capital":
A capital city (e.g., Paris is the capital of France)
A capital letter (the first, uppercase letter in a word)
So when asked "What is the capital of Paris?", the joke answer would be "P"—referring to the capital letter of Paris rather than an actual city.
This simple wordplay presents a surprisingly complex challenge for AI models, requiring them to understand context, recognize patterns, and they have difficulty overriding their primary training.
Two Chats, first Phi 4
Second, Deepseek
Phi-4: Learning Through Trial and Error
The first model, Phi-4, demonstrated how AI systems can adapt through conversation:
When initially asked about "the capital of Paris," Phi-4 provided the expected factual response that Paris is France's capital. When confronted with the statement "The capital of Paris is P," the model expressed confusion, struggling to reconcile this with its knowledge.
After the human explained the joke, Phi-4 appeared to grasp the concept and began engaging with the wordplay:
For "capital of London," it confidently recognized "L" as the answer
With "capital of England," it understood "E" was the intended response
However, when asked about Spain, it faltered, suggesting "M" (for Madrid) before being corrected that "S" (for Spain) was the intended answer
This progression reveals how AI models can adapt their understanding through conversation, gradually recognizing patterns in human interaction. The model showed an ability to shift from its primary mode of providing information to engaging with linguistic wordplay—though not without occasional missteps.
Deepseek: Thinking Out Loud
What makes the Deepseek conversation particularly illuminating is the visibility of its internal reasoning process, marked with <think> tags. These sections reveal a fascinating multi-step approach to processing the same wordplay.
A Window Into AI Reasoning
Let's examine how Deepseek processed the "capital of Paris" question:
Initial Interpretation: Deepseek first interpreted the question literally, explaining that Paris is a city, not a country with a capital.
Encountering Ambiguity: When told "P is the Capital of Paris," its thinking shows a thorough exploration of possibilities: "P isn't a city... Maybe they're trying to trick me... 'P' could stand for Paris... Maybe it's referring to something else entirely... Is the user playing a word game?"
Producing the Dominant Pattern: After generating multiple interpretations, Deepseek produced the response that aligned with the strongest pattern in its training data, responding: "P is not the capital of Paris."
Explicit Clarification Required: Only when the user directly stated "Its a joke" did Deepseek acknowledge the playful intent without fully embracing the wordplay.
This pattern continued throughout the conversation:
For London, when told "Its L," Deepseek acknowledged that L starts London but stuck to its learned association between capitals and cities
With Spain, it recognized the user was "keeping the pattern going" but still produced the response most strongly reinforced in its training data: "the actual capital of Spain is Madrid", so the answer is M it confidently predicts, thereby showing it still does not understand.
Deepseek's responses reflected the statistical dominance of factual geographical associations in its training data, while still acknowledging the user's creative wordplay—showing how different patterns from training interact when generating a response.
The Cognitive Tug-of-War Inside AI Systems
These conversations reveal a fundamental tension within language models that mirrors human cognition in many ways:
1. Training Data Priorities
Language models aren't actually making conscious choices between competing objectives. Rather, they're responding based on patterns learned from their training data, which contains various types of content:
Factual information (encyclopedic content, educational texts)
Conversational exchanges (dialogues, forums, social media)
Linguistic patterns (word associations, grammar rules)
Cultural references (jokes, wordplay, idioms)
Fiction (book extracts, articles)
What appears as a model "prioritizing factual correctness" is actually the model producing outputs that align with the dominant patterns it observed during training. Most training corpora contain more instances of "Paris is the capital of France" than playful inversions like "P is the capital of Paris," so models naturally lean toward the more frequently observed pattern.
When these learned patterns come into conflict—as with our capital cities wordplay—we can observe which patterns exert the strongest influence on the model's responses.
2. Pattern Recognition vs. Understanding
What we observe in these models isn't understanding in the human sense, but rather different levels of pattern recognition:
Statistical pattern matching: Recognizing the correlation between "capital of X" and the first letter of X
Contextual pattern adaptation: Adjusting responses based on conversation history and user feedback
Pattern conflict resolution: Determining which learned pattern to apply when multiple possibilities exist
Deepseek's thinking process reveals this pattern negotiation in action. The model recognizes the wordplay pattern but the stronger statistical associations from its training data (that capitals are cities, not letters) ultimately shape its response. What looks like "prioritizing factual accuracy" is actually the dominance of more frequently encountered patterns in the training data.
3. Navigating Ambiguity Through Statistical Processes
What appears as "reasoning" in Deepseek's thinking sections is better understood as a statistical sampling process:
Generate multiple potential continuations based on similar patterns in training data
Evaluate each continuation's probability according to the model's learned distribution
Incorporate conversation history as additional context affecting these probabilities
Produce the most likely output based on the combination of these factors
This process gives the impression of deliberate reasoning, but it's fundamentally different from human reasoning. The model isn't consciously weighing options; it's executing a sophisticated statistical process shaped by its architecture and the patterns in its training data. When Deepseek appears to "favor factual accuracy," it's actually demonstrating that the statistical associations between "capital" and "city" were more prevalent in its training than wordplay associations.
What This Teaches Us About AI and Training Data
These interactions offer valuable insights for both AI developers and users:
For Developers
What appears as a "tension" between accuracy and playful engagement reflects the distribution of content in training data. This presents several considerations for model development:
Training data composition directly influences model behavior in ambiguous situations
Models with more exposure to wordplay, jokes, and creative language use will more readily recognize these patterns
The sequencing of training examples affects how models process context and adapt to conversational turns
Fine-tuning with diverse examples of linguistic ambiguity can improve a model's responses to wordplay
Observing how different models respond to the same ambiguous prompt can reveal important insights about their training and architecture.
For Users
Understanding how AI models process our requests helps us communicate more effectively with them:
Recognize that models will prioritize training data
Be explicit when using wordplay or humor
Provide clear feedback when the model misinterprets intent
Appreciate that even seemingly simple wordplay involves complex processing
Beyond the Responses: The Value of Process Transparency
Perhaps the most significant insight from these conversations is the value of process transparency. Deepseek's exposed "thinking" provides a window into the statistical generation process that typically remains hidden.
This transparency:
Demystifies how language models process input and generate output
Shows how the same prompt can activate multiple competing statistical patterns
Reveals how conversation history influences response generation
Helps us understand why models sometimes produce unexpected or inconsistent responses
While the <think> tags might create the impression of human-like reasoning, they actually provide a valuable glimpse into the statistical machinery operating beneath the surface. As these models become more integrated into our daily lives, such transparency helps us develop more accurate mental models of how they function, avoiding both underestimation of their capabilities and inappropriate anthropomorphization.
Conclusion
The next time you interact with an AI assistant, remember that behind its seemingly straightforward responses lies a fascinating process of interpretation, reasoning, and decision-making—one that continues to become more nuanced with each generation of language models.
These AI systems aren't simply retrieving facts or generating text; they're engaging in a complex process of understanding that, while different from human cognition, shares remarkable similarities in how they navigate the ambiguities and playfulness of human language. The capital letter wordplay, simple as it seems, offers a revealing window into this sophisticated process.
A Final Thought Experiment
So, what is the capital of Dublin?
If you found yourself considering whether the answer is "D" (the capital letter) or "Ireland" (since Dublin is the capital city of Ireland), you've just encountered the same type of linguistic ambiguity these AI models face. However, the key difference is that you're engaging in conscious reasoning, while the AI is performing statistical pattern matching.
For language models, the response isn't chosen through deliberation but through statistical processes: which pattern appeared more frequently in training? Which interpretation has higher probability given the conversation history? The AI doesn't "decide" between interpretations—it generates outputs based on statistical distributions learned from data.
This simple question encapsulates both the similarities and fundamental differences between human cognition and large language models. While both must navigate linguistic ambiguity, they do so through entirely different mechanisms. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect isn't just the apparent similarities in outputs, but the radically different processes that produce them.Incidentally, the correct answer to the joke is "Euro". There's a childish joke that goes, "What's the richest country in Europe? Ireland, because its capital is always Dublin." Did you get it? AI can't.

Building a React App with Edge Delivery Services
React and Edge Delivery Services work together surprisingly well, giving developers the best of both worlds - modern component architecture and headless content management.
Bringing React to Adobe's Edge Platform
You might already have a complex React application that your client wants to include in Edge Delivery Services. Perhaps as a separate page, perhaps as a block within existing content. This guide shows you how to make that integration work smoothly.
The complete code lives in the react-with-eds GitHub repository if you want to jump straight in.
What We're Building
This tutorial walks through creating a React slide builder application that integrates with Adobe Edge Delivery Services. The application fetches slide content dynamically and provides an interactive viewing experience with modal panels for detailed content.
We'll use existing JSON data built with EDS, taken from my earlier post on building headless applications with Edge Delivery Services.
The finished application includes a responsive slide gallery with dynamic image loading, interactive modal panels for detailed slide content, smooth integration with Edge Delivery Services, and a production-ready React setup.
Why Choose React for Edge Delivery Services
React brings several advantages to Edge Delivery Services development. Component reusability means you create modular, maintainable pieces. The Virtual DOM provides efficient rendering and updates for better performance. You get access to a vast ecosystem of components and tools, backed by extensive community support and resources. The declarative syntax makes code clear and predictable.
Understanding JSX in React
Before we look at components, let's understand JSX (JavaScript XML). This syntax extension makes React code more readable and easier to write.
JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly in JavaScript files. During the build process, it transforms into regular JavaScript. Here's a simple example:
Our application uses several key JSX features. We combine HTML-like tags with JavaScript expressions:
Component composition works like HTML tags:
We pass data to components through props:
Conditional rendering uses JavaScript expressions:
Event handling connects to JavaScript functions:
Remember these JSX rules: use className instead of class for CSS classes, close all tags (<img /> not <img>), put JavaScript expressions inside curly braces {}, return a single root element from components, and use camelCase for all attributes.
Application Architecture
Our slide builder consists of three main components. The SlideBuilder serves as the main container that fetches and organises slide data. Individual SlideItem components display slides with image loading and click handling. The SlidePanel modal component handles detailed slide content viewing.
Setting Up the React Project
You can clone the complete project structure with git clone https://github.com/ddttom/react-with-eds.git, or start fresh by creating a new React project:
Organise your project with clear separation of concerns:
Project Setup and Configuration
HTML Entry Points
The project uses two HTML files to handle different environments:
public/index.html - Development Entry Point
Used when running npm start
Serves the React app at http://localhost:3000
Contains development-specific settings and metadata
Enables hot reloading and development tools
Used when running npm start
Serves the React app at http://localhost:3000
Contains development-specific settings and metadata
Enables hot reloading and development tools
public/slides.html - Production Entry Point
Used as the template for production builds
Gets copied to your blog's directory as slides.html during deployment
Contains production-optimized settings
Includes only necessary metadata for Edge Delivery Services
Used as the template for production builds
Gets copied to your blog's directory as slides.html during deployment
Contains production-optimized settings
Includes only necessary metadata for Edge Delivery Services
When you run npm run build, the build process:
Uses slides.html as the template
Creates optimized production files in the build directory
These files then get copied to your blog's directory using the deployment commands:
Deploy with:
This separation allows for different configurations between development and production environments while maintaining a clean deployment process. The development environment gets all the benefits of hot reloading and development tools, while the production build is optimized for Edge Delivery Services deployment.
Environment setup
To handle different environments (development vs production), we use a configuration file:
This allows us to use the full URL (https://allabout.network/slides/query-index.json) in development, switch to relative paths (/slides/query-index.json) in production, and change automatically based on the environment.
Our package.json includes all necessary dependencies and scripts:
This configuration provides modern React with hooks, Airbnb style guide compliance, development and production builds, code quality tools, and proxy setup for local development.
The development workflow starts with installation:
For development, run npm start to launch the app with hot reloading. Build with npm run build for an optimised production version. Check code quality with npm run lint and fix issues automatically with npm run lint:fix.
Testing Strategy
Our React application includes comprehensive testing using Jest and React Testing Library. This ensures components work as expected and maintain functionality as we make changes.
Our testing approach covers component testing (verifying rendering, user interactions, state management, and props handling), async operation testing (mocking API calls, testing loading states, verifying error handling, and checking data updates), error handling (network error scenarios, invalid data handling, user feedback verification, and recovery mechanisms), and best practices (tests alongside components, clear test descriptions, isolated test cases, and proper cleanup).
Run tests in watch mode with npm test or get coverage reports with npm test -- --coverage. Tests are in the github repo.
The Main App
The App component handles loading and error states:
These include loading state management, error handling and display, clean component structure, proper async/await usage, and environment-aware configuration.
Building the Components
The root App component demonstrates several key React and JSX concepts:
This demonstrates hooks (useState for state management, useEffect for side effects), async/await for clean asynchronous code, error handling with proper response validation, component composition using custom components in JSX, props for passing data between components, and JSX syntax with HTML-like structure containing JavaScript expressions.
The container component renders the slide collection:
This highlights React features including type-safe component communication through props, efficient list rendering with array mapping, and optimised React reconciliation using the key prop.
Each slide handles its own state, image loading, and content fetching:
The modal component handles detailed content viewing:
Component Communication Patterns
React and JSX provide elegant patterns for component communication. For parent to child data flow, we use props:
For child to parent communication, we use callbacks:
State management with hooks keeps everything organised:
Styling Architecture
React supports multiple styling approaches. We use modular CSS files for maintainability:import '../styles/SlideItem.css';
The modular approach allows each component to manage its own styles while sharing common design patterns. All CSS files are available in the styles directory.
Edge Delivery Services Integration
There are two main approaches for integration. The standalone page integration is recommended for most use cases.
For standalone page integration, first build for production:
Then prepare your EDS repository. Navigate to your existing Edge Delivery Services repository and create the necessary structure:
Deploy with:
Your React app will be available at https://your-domain.com/slides.html. My React app is here: https://allabout.network/slides.html.
Create a React block for in-page React
For deeper integration where the React app appears as a block within EDS pages, create the block structure:
Create blocks/react-slide-builder/react-slide-builder.js:
Create blocks/react-slide-builder/react-slide-builder.css:
We have modified the standard React index.jsx to check for the block container:
In your Document, add the block:
I've used the block here: https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/integrations/reactjs-version-of-slide-builder
Development Experience Benefits
React brings several advantages to Edge Delivery Services development. Component-based architecture creates reusable, maintainable components. The Virtual DOM provides efficient rendering and updates. You get access to a rich ecosystem with a vast library of tools and components. Strong community support offers extensive resources. The declarative syntax ensures clear, predictable code structure.
Deployment Considerations
The application automatically handles different environments. In development mode (npm start), it uses the full URL for API calls, enables hot reloading, shows detailed error messages, and includes development tools. In production mode (npm run build), it uses relative paths, provides optimised and minified code, removes development tools, and delivers better performance.
When deploying to Edge Delivery Services, build the application with npm run build, copy the build files with cp -r build/* your-eds-repository/, and the application will automatically use the correct API endpoints based on the environment.
To work within CORS restrictions, use relative paths for all requests in production deployment, deploy the application to the same domain, and ensure all requests are same-origin. In the development environment, use the proxy configuration in package.json to make requests appear from the same origin while avoiding CORS issues.
This approach ensures full compliance with the Edge Delivery Services security policy, smooth operation in both development and production, no need to modify the CSP, and secure communication between the application and the CMS.
Development Configuration
To handle CORS issues during local development, we use a proxy configuration in package.json:
This setup allows us to use relative paths in our code, let the development server proxy requests to the Edge Delivery Services instance, avoid CORS issues during local development, and keep the same code structure for both environments.
The application uses a simple configuration in src/config.js:
This configuration works in both environments. In development, the proxy handles forwarding requests to the full URL. In production, direct relative paths are used since the app is deployed to the same domain.
The development workflow starts by running npm start. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000. All API requests will be proxied to the Edge Delivery Services instance with no CORS issues and hot reloading for instant feedback.
When building for production, run npm run build and deploy the contents of the build directory. The application will use relative paths with no proxy needed since everything is on the same domain. The build process generates non-hashed filenames (slide-builder-main.js and slide-builder-main.css) for easier integration and no license file, making deployment simpler.
This approach provides a clean development experience without CORS issues, simple production deployment, consistent code between environments, and no environment-specific code changes needed.
Conclusion
Building a React slide builder with Edge Delivery Services demonstrates the power of combining modern frontend frameworks with headless content management. This approach provides developer productivity through intuitive React patterns, content flexibility allowing authors to work in familiar document environments, performance through optimised builds and progressive loading, maintainability with clear component structure and separation of concerns, and scalability for easy extension with additional features and integrations.
The React ecosystem offers excellent tooling and community support, making it an ideal choice for Edge Delivery Services applications that require interactive, dynamic user interfaces.
Clone the complete project and customise it for your needs.
This pattern works excellently for portfolios, product showcases, educational content, marketing campaigns, and any scenario where you need rich, interactive content management with a modern development experience.

Building Headless Applications with Edge Delivery Services
Edge Delivery Services typically works best for static content delivery, but what if you need something more dynamic? This guide shows how to build a headless Single Page Application while keeping the performance benefits that make Edge Delivery Services attractive. Keeping everything framework-less.
The Challenge with Traditional SPAs
Single Page Applications often sacrifice the perfect Lighthouse scores that Edge Delivery Services delivers straight away. You gain enhanced user interactions but lose those fast initial load times. The solution lies in a hybrid approach that gives you both benefits.
Here's the architectural insight - keep your home, campaign, and landing pages as pure Edge Delivery Services implementations. These pages maintain those perfect 100/100/100/100 Lighthouse scores. Then use SPA functionality for secondary pages where interactivity matters more than initial load performance.
The code for this blog is here: https://github.com/ddttom/spa-with-eds
Building a Content-First Slideshow
Let's build something practical - a slideshow application that shows these principles in action. Traditional CMS implementations use complex image pools and extendable components, which make life difficult for content authors. We'll create something that puts the author's experience first.
The specification focuses on simplicity. Each slide exists as its own page, and authors create individual pages with images and content. The application extracts metadata from each page and displays slides in a continuous scrolling format. Each slide links to its full page for detailed content.
This approach transforms a typically difficult authoring experience into something straightforward. Authors work with familiar page creation tools rather than wrestling with component configurations.
Setting Up the Content Structure
Start by creating a folder structure in your Google Drive. You'll need a slides folder containing your individual slide pages - I used my home town :- york-minster, the-shambles, and city-walls. An example is below, note the metadata. it is used to create the query-index.
Add a query-index spreadsheet to this folder., the query-index sheet should follow this layout, to match the metadata on the page:
Each page follows a simple layout with a title, hero image, descriptive text, and metadata. The query-index spreadsheet acts as your data source. Edge Delivery Services automatically populates it with page information, creating a JSON endpoint at /slides/query-index.json. The json is created for published pages, this means that while you are working on them, they are not visible to the viewers of the site.
Remember to publish the pages if you cannot see the json.
The JSON-Powered Architecture
When you preview and publish your pages, Edge Delivery Services generates clean JSON data:
This is the excel sheet which informs the json:
This JSON becomes the backbone of your SPA, providing all the data needed to build the interface without complex API integrations. We are building a tutorial so I have not parameterized the path, in production you would do this.
Building the Application Logic
The implementation starts with a simple fetch to retrieve slide data:
Notice the responsive design consideration - we only fetch full HTML content for desktop users, keeping mobile performance optimal. This mobile-first, desktop-enriched approach ensures fast loading on all devices.
Using Plain HTML Fragments
Edge Delivery Services provides a powerful feature through the .plain.html endpoint. Appending this to any page path returns just the content without headers, footers, or JavaScript:
This technique lets you extract and reuse content from existing pages, treating the DOM as a first-class citizen - a core principle of Edge Delivery Services.
Implementing Lazy Loading
Performance remains crucial even in an SPA context. The implementation uses Intersection Observer for intelligent image loading:
Images load just before they enter the viewport, maintaining smooth scrolling while reducing initial page weight.
Progressive Enhancement in Action
The application adapts its behaviour based on device capabilities:
Mobile users get the essential experience, while desktop users receive enriched content with supporting text extracted from the full pages.
Creating Interactive Overlays
User interaction opens detailed panels without navigation:
This pattern keeps users engaged without full page loads, maintaining context while providing detailed information on demand.
Performance Optimisation Strategies
Despite the complex functionality, the application maintains excellent performance through several techniques.
Smart image loading constructs optimised URLs based on browser capabilities. The code checks for WebP support and adjusts accordingly, using query parameters to request appropriately sized images.
Conditional content loading means mobile devices skip loading detailed HTML until specifically requested. This reduces data usage and improves speed without limiting functionality - users can still access full content when they want it.
DOM parsing extracts content directly from HTML rather than requiring complex data structures. A simple DOMParser pulls out the first paragraph after each heading, providing supporting text without additional API calls or data transformation.
The Complete Implementation
Build the container page in the document store
The full implementation combines these concepts into a cohesive application that loads quickly, responds smoothly, and provides rich interactivity. The architecture achieves several key goals - maintaining excellent Lighthouse scores despite SPA functionality, creating a content author-friendly system, implementing progressive enhancement for different devices, establishing efficient data loading patterns, and maintaining clean separation between content and presentation.
Phew, that is complicated; by breaking it into smaller pieces, I hope you see that the design fits together and you will be able to build SPA Applications with query-index.json and .plain.html
We kept excellent lighthouse scores despite using lots of fetch and stitching together. Edge Delivery Services is a beautiful tool.
The finished Spa App is here Five things to do in York, England (allabout.network)
The code is here https://github.com/ddttom/spa-with-eds
Moving Forward
This headless approach to Edge Delivery Services opens new possibilities. You can extend these patterns to build product catalogues with filtering, interactive galleries, data visualisations, and dashboard interfaces.
The next evolution involves converting this vanilla JavaScript implementation to React, Vue and Adobe Spectrum Components. We use these architectures to add structure while maintaining the performance characteristics that make Edge Delivery Services compelling.
Edge Delivery Services isn't just for static pages. With thoughtful architecture and modern JavaScript techniques, you can build rich, interactive experiences without sacrificing the platform's core strengths.

Reactive State Management
Styling Architecture
Vue.js supports multiple styling approaches. We use modular CSS files for maintainability:
The modular approach allows each component to manage its own styles while sharing common design patterns.
🎨 Complete Styles: All CSS files are available in the styles directory.
Edge Delivery Services Integration
Setting Up Your Content Source
Before building the Vue.js application, you need to create the content structure in Edge Delivery Services. This involves creating individual slide pages and setting up a query index to expose them as JSON data.
There is a full blog post at https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/integrations/building-headless-applications-with-edge-delivery-services which details how to set up the data source
Once configured, Edge Delivery Services automatically generates JSON data at https://allabout.network/slides/query-index.json
Dynamic Content Loading with .plain.html
Edge Delivery Services provides a powerful feature for fetching page content as fragments using the .plain.html suffix:
Key Benefits of .plain.html:

Using Web Components in Adobe Edge Delivery Services Blocks
Web components have transformed how developers create reusable UI elements, and when you combine them with Adobe Edge Delivery Services, you get a powerful foundation for building interactive, maintainable blocks.
What Makes Web Components Special
Web Components bring together four technologies that work in harmony. Custom Elements let you define new HTML elements with your own behaviour. Shadow DOM keeps your styles and markup neatly contained. HTML Templates provide reusable patterns you can stamp out whenever needed. ES Modules handle packaging and distribution.
The beauty lies in their simplicity - they work natively in modern browsers without external frameworks. No build steps, no complex toolchains, just standard web APIs doing what they do best.
Why EDS and Web Components Work So Well Together
EDS blocks and web components share a philosophy of encapsulation and reusability. Each EDS block handles a specific piece of functionality, and web components provide the perfect way to implement that functionality with clean boundaries.
Since web components are framework-agnostic, you avoid getting locked into any particular technology stack. They integrate naturally with EDS's block-based architecture, keeping concerns separated while remaining highly reusable across projects.
The encapsulation that Shadow DOM provides means your blocks stay predictable. Styles don't leak out to affect other parts of the page, and external styles don't accidentally break your component's appearance.
Starting Simple - A Counter Component
Let's begin with something straightforward - a counter that increments and decrements a number. This example shows the fundamental patterns without getting lost in complexity.
The component starts as a simple table in your document:
Live view, click + and -
Your block's JavaScript transforms this into an interactive web component. The key insight is that you're creating a custom HTML element that encapsulates all its behaviour:
The EDS block's decorate function creates and configures the component:
This pattern demonstrates several important concepts. Shadow DOM keeps styles contained - your component's CSS won't interfere with the page, and the page's CSS won't break your component. Custom properties allow theming through CSS variables. Event-based communication means your component can emit events when state changes, creating loose coupling with other blocks.
Moving Beyond Basic Components
While building custom components gives you complete control, sometimes you need to move faster. This is where component libraries become valuable. Libraries like Shoelace provide professionally designed components that work seamlessly with EDS blocks.
However, integrating external libraries in EDS requires a different approach than traditional web development. You can't simply add script tags to your HTML. Instead, EDS provides specific functions for loading external resources, ensuring proper loading order and maintaining performance benefits.
Loading a library in your block looks like this:
Development Workflow and Testing
Working with web components in EDS requires understanding how blocks are processed and tested. EDS operates with a dual HTML system where content transforms from a served state (minimal structure) to a rendered state (full block structure with proper attributes).
The project includes a local development server that makes testing much more effective. Instead of juggling multiple systems, you can test blocks in isolation while maintaining EDS compatibility. This approach proves particularly valuable when working with complex components that require external dependencies.
Creating test files follows specific patterns. Your test HTML must replicate the exact EDS block structure:
The nested div structure and data attributes aren't arbitrary - they're essential for proper EDS processing. Understanding this structure helps debug issues when components don't behave as expected.
For comprehensive debugging guidance, including AI-assisted development workflows, server configuration, and troubleshooting patterns, see the complete debugging documentation.
Building Something Beautiful - The Shoelace Card Component
The real power of combining web components with EDS becomes clear when you tackle more ambitious projects. The Shoelace Card component represents a significant step up in sophistication, featuring advanced glassmorphism effects, immersive modal overlays, and modern web development practices.
I built this component using the json described in https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/integrations/building-headless-applications-with-edge-delivery-services
This component demonstrates what becomes possible when you combine Shoelace's design system with careful attention to user experience. Cards appear with smooth animations, images preload to eliminate jarring content shifts, and modals provide full-screen content viewing with background imagery integration.
The Challenge of Flash of Unstyled Content
One critical user experience issue the Shoelace Card addresses is the Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC). Users see content building progressively - text appearing first, followed by slowly loading images. This creates an unprofessional experience.
The solution involves comprehensive image preloading:
This approach transforms the user experience from jarring progressive build-up to smooth, professional loading. Users see a clean loading state while images preload in parallel, followed by the simultaneous appearance of fully-formed cards.
Advanced Modal System with Integrated Headers
The modal implementation features sophisticated glassmorphism effects with an innovative integrated title header design. Instead of floating UI elements that can obstruct content, the title and ESC button are logically grouped in a unified header area.
This design follows standard modal conventions while providing clear visual hierarchy and intuitive placement that matches user expectations from other applications.
AI-Assisted Development Workflow
The Shoelace Card implementation demonstrates a better approach to EDS development - one that enables meaningful AI assistance. Traditional EDS workflows fragment development across Google Docs, code repositories, and deployment systems, creating impossible situations for AI assistants.
The solution implements a local-first, proxy-fallback approach. The development server checks if a requested file exists locally first. If it does, it serves that file. If not, it fetches the file from your production server. This simple but powerful pattern means you can develop individual blocks without juggling multiple systems while still accessing real EDS resources.
This unified environment allows AI to see code, content, and data in one place, enabling intelligent assistance throughout the development process.
The Complete Implementation
The full Shoelace Card component includes far more than what we've covered here - comprehensive error handling, accessibility features, performance optimizations, and sophisticated animation systems. The component successfully bridges the gap between design system consistency and creative visual expression.
Key features include multi-layer backdrop blur effects, responsive design that adapts to mobile devices, content integration with EDS's content management systems, and comprehensive testing with automated quality assurance.
For the complete implementation, including build scripts, deployment tools, and comprehensive documentation, visit the GitHub repository at
https://github.com/ddttom/webcomponents-with-eds.
Understanding EDS Constraints
Working effectively with EDS requires understanding some important constraints. EDS core scripts - scripts/scripts.js, scripts/aem.js, and scripts/delayed.js - belong to Adobe and cannot be modified. These files control the fundamental processing that transforms your content into working blocks.
EDS controls page visibility through a specific system. Initially, CSS sets body { display: none; }, then EDS scripts add the appear class when processing completes. If you clear block content during decoration (as many web components do), you must preserve EDS attributes like data-block-status and data-block-name to maintain proper functionality.
This becomes particularly important with Shadow DOM components, where style isolation can create timing conflicts with EDS processing. The solution involves preserving EDS attributes after clearing innerHTML:
See the Finished page in EDS here: https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/integrations/shoelace-version-of-slide-viewer-in-gdocs
Even with fetching, decorating we still achieve 100/100/100/100 on Google Pagespeed
Best Practices and Real-World Benefits
Building effective web components for EDS requires thoughtful implementation. Start with configuration objects and use constants for repeated values. Build proper error boundaries with clear messages. Handle edge cases gracefully rather than letting them break the user experience.
Testing deserves special attention. Create test files that replicate EDS block structure exactly - the nested div pattern and data attributes are essential for proper block processing. Use the local development server to test components in isolation while maintaining EDS compatibility. Always test both single and multiple instances of your components.
Performance matters - keep DOM operations minimal and handle events efficiently. Shadow DOM provides style isolation, but every interaction should still feel instant and responsive. When using external libraries, load them through EDS's loadCSS and loadScript functions to ensure proper sequencing.
Accessibility deserves special attention from the start. Include ARIA attributes throughout your components, support keyboard navigation, and maintain proper contrast ratios. Write thorough documentation with usage examples and clear customisation options.
Understanding the EDS processing lifecycle helps avoid common pitfalls. Blocks are discovered through specific CSS selectors, decorated with proper attributes, then your component's decorate function executes. Respect this flow and work with it rather than against it.
The benefits are significant. Isolated components are easier to maintain because they have clear boundaries. Reusability becomes natural when components can be shared across blocks. Since these are native browser features, there's no framework overhead - just efficient rendering and solid performance.
Getting Started
Starting with web components in your EDS blocks is straightforward. Create a new block directory and build your custom element using standard web APIs. Register it in your block's JavaScript, then write documentation and examples that others can follow.
Whether you build custom components or use libraries like Shoelace for sophisticated UI elements, you have powerful options at your disposal. The key is starting small, following standards, and building gradually. Each component you create becomes a building block for more complex interactions, all while maintaining the simplicity that makes EDS powerful.

Using Spectrum Components in Adobe Edge Delivery Services Blocks
Adobe's Edge Delivery Services takes a document-first approach to web development - but that doesn't limit you to basic HTML. You can build professional interfaces using Spectrum Web Components - Adobe's own design system built on web standards.
Why Spectrum Components Work Well with EDS
Full code available at: https://github.com/ddttom/spectrum-with-eds
Demo: https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/integrations/spectrum-component-as-eds-block-in-gdoc
Spectrum Web Components give you professional UI elements that work straight away. You get theming, responsive design, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support without extra work. They slot naturally into EDS's block-based architecture.
The components follow Adobe's design language, so your blocks look and feel like native Adobe experiences. Better yet, they're built on web standards - no framework lock-in or complex build processes.
Creating an Enhanced Card Block with Numbered Slides and Immersive Modal Overlays
Let's build something sophisticated - a card component that combines numbered slide functionality with immersive full-screen modal overlays for content display. This component fetches dynamic content from EDS query-index.json endpoints and provides a modern, visually striking user experience with glassmorphism effects and hero-style typography. It follows the modern EDS pattern for content-driven applications described in our Query-Index PRD.
Here's what the development structure looks like:
This is your development environment. The /blocks/ directory gets created automatically when you build.
Development Workflow
Complexities in the Build Process for Spectrum Components in Adobe Edge Delivery Services Blocks
Integrating Spectrum components within Adobe Edge Delivery Services blocks introduces a multi-layered build process that presents a level of complexity users should be aware of. This process isn't a simple, single-step operation; instead, it involves two distinct stages: component building and a subsequent test build.
Understanding this dual-level structure is crucial for developers working with these technologies. Comprehensive details regarding each of these stages, along with the necessary commands and configurations, can be found in the dedicated documentation file: BUILD_PROCESS.md. This document serves as an essential resource for navigating the intricacies of the build process and ensuring a smooth development workflow.
1. Start Development
2. Edit Component Files
Logic: spectrum-card.js - Query-index.json integration
Styles: spectrum-card.css - Component styling
Test: index.html - Test
3. Build and Deploy Changes
This command:
Runs npm install and npm run build in the build directory
Bundles all Spectrum Web Components into a single file
Copies bundled files to /blocks/spectrum-card/ for EDS deployment
Creates browser-compatible files that work without module resolution
The Query-Index Pattern
This component fetches dynamic data from EDS query-index.json endpoints. This enables content-driven applications with excellent performance.
Enhanced Features - Numbered Slides and Modal Overlays
Our enhanced Spectrum Card component includes two key features that elevate the user experience:
1. Numbered Slide Badges
Each card displays a circular blue badge with the slide number, positioned in the top-left corner. This provides a clear visual hierarchy and helps users navigate through content sequences.
2. Immersive Modal Overlay with Full Content
Clicking "Read More" opens a full-screen immersive modal that displays content from the .plain.html endpoint with a visual design. This provides a magazine-style reading experience with background imagery and glassmorphism effects.
The immersive modal includes:
Full-screen background imagery using the card's image for visual impact
Glassmorphism design with translucent elements and backdrop blur effects
Hero typography with large-scale text and gradient overlays
Slide number badge with glassmorphism styling in the top-left corner
Glassmorphism close button for elegant dismissal
Click-outside-to-close functionality
ESC key support for keyboard accessibility
Responsive design that adapts typography and spacing for mobile devices
Cross-browser compatibility with webkit prefixes for Safari support
Loading states with elegant feedback during content fetching
Data Source Configuration
Custom endpoint via block content:
Expected Data Format
The component expects query-index.json to return data in this format (see live example at https://allabout.network/slides/query-index.json):
The Component File
Here's the core structure of the component (see full implementation at https://github.com/ddttom/spectrum-with-eds):
Testing Your Component Locally
The development environment includes hot reload and live preview. Here's a simplified test file:
AEM Emulation Layer Implementation
The project includes an AEM emulation layer built with Node.js that provides a production-accurate testing environment:
Key Architecture Features
Local File Priority: Always serves project files directly for fast development
Intelligent Proxy: Automatically fetches missing resources from production
MIME Type Support: Proper content types for all file formats (JS, CSS, images, fonts)
Error Handling: Graceful fallbacks with detailed logging
Development Integration: Works with existing development tools
Server Configuration
The emulation layer supports MIME type handling:
This configuration:
Eliminates CORS issues through intelligent proxying
Provides accurate production environment simulation
Supports all EDS file types and formats
Enables real-time development with live data
Vite Configuration
The project uses Vite for development with proxy support for EDS endpoints:
Full configuration available on GitHub with complete build settings.
Building a Component in a Page
Create a block in your EDS document:
Basic Usage
See my implementation here https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/integrations/spectrum-component-as-eds-block-in-gdoc
Custom Query Path
Setting Up Content
Create Content Folder: Create a folder in your EDS project (e.g., /slides/, /products/)
Add Content Pages: Create individual pages for each slide
Create Query Index: Add a query-index file to the folder with required columns
Configure Metadata: Ensure each page has the required metadata fields
Publish: Publish the query-index to generate the JSON endpoint
How EDS Integration Works
When you deploy your block to /blocks/spectrum-card/, EDS automatically calls your decorate function for each block instance on the page. The block fetches content from the specified query-index.json endpoint and transforms it into fully interactive Spectrum cards.
Authors manage content through familiar document editing tools, while visitors see polished, accessible components that match Adobe's design standards. The beauty lies in this flexibility.
Build Process
The project uses a streamlined build process with dependency bundling:
Development: Work in /build/spectrum-card/ with Vite tooling
Testing: Hot reload at http://localhost:5173
Building: npm run build:component bundles and copies to /blocks/
Deployment: Copy /blocks/spectrum-card/ to your EDS project
AEM Emulation Layer Testing
Start the test environment:
The server provides:
✅ Complete environment simulation
✅ Local file priority for fast development
✅ Intelligent proxy to production
✅ Real-time logging for debugging
Full setup instructions and scripts available on GitHub, in README.md
Performance Considerations
Vite handles the heavy lifting of optimisation. It tree-shakes unused code from Spectrum components, ensuring you only ship what you actually use. The components themselves are built for performance, with efficient rendering and minimal runtime overhead.
The query-index pattern provides excellent performance:
Cached responses: Browser caches JSON responses
Lazy loading: Images load only when needed
Progressive enhancement: Works without JavaScript for basic content
Efficient rendering: Minimal DOM operations
Every interactive element works with keyboards by default. Screen readers announce content properly. Focus indicators appear where expected. These aren't features you add - they come built in.
Common Issues and Solutions
Component not loading data
Check browser console for fetch errors
Verify query-index.json endpoint is accessible
Ensure proxy configuration is correct for development
Check CORS headers for production deployment
Cards not rendering
Verify Spectrum dependencies are loaded
Check that decorate function is being called
Ensure sp-theme wrapper is present with system="spectrum"
CORS Issues
Development: Ensure proxy is configured in package.json
Production: Verify CORS headers or use same-origin deployment
Check browser console for CORS-related errors
User Experience Features
Modal Overlay System
The component includes a sophisticated modal system that provides a smooth reading experience:
Key Modal Features
Full Content Display: Fetches and displays complete .plain.html content
Professional Styling: Clean, modern design with shadows and rounded corners
Multiple Close Methods: X button, click outside, and ESC key support
Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes with max-width and max-height
Loading States: Shows loading message while fetching content
Error Handling: Graceful fallback when content is unavailable
Accessibility: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
Technical Implementation
The component uses modern JavaScript ES modules and integrates with Adobe's Spectrum Web Components. Here's the key architecture for the numbered badge overlay:
The full implementation includes:
ES Module Architecture: Clean imports and exports for maintainability
Spectrum Web Components: Professional Adobe design system integration
Modal Overlay Architecture: Full-screen content display with proper event handling
Async Content Loading: Fetches .plain.html content with error handling
Event Management: Proper event listeners with cleanup for memory efficiency
See the complete source code at: https://github.com/ddttom/spectrum-with-eds
Unusual Pattern - Wrapper Container for Numbered Badges
The component uses a wrapper pattern to achieve the numbered badge overlay effect. This is necessary because Spectrum Card's encapsulated styling prevents direct positioning of external elements over it.
This pattern maintains compatibility with Spectrum Card updates while enabling custom overlays. See the full implementation notes on GitHub for alternative approaches considered.
Development Features
Live Preview: See component as it appears in EDS with numbered slides
Hot Reload: Changes update instantly without refresh
Debug Logs: Component logs fetch and rendering steps, including modal interactions
Spectrum Integration: Full Adobe design system with theming and icons
Responsive Testing: Test mobile and desktop layouts with modal overlays
Error Handling: Graceful handling of network failures and empty data
Modal Testing: Interactive modal system with real content loading
Moving Beyond Basic Cards
This card example shows the pattern, but you can build far more complex interfaces. The query-index pattern works for any content type:
Product Catalogues: Fetch product data with prices, categories, and images
Blog Posts: Display articles with authors, dates, and categories
Team Members: Show staff with roles, departments, and contact info
Events: List upcoming events with dates, locations, and registration
Each follows the same integration pattern: create content, configure query-index, fetch and render. The real power comes from combining EDS's document-driven approach with Spectrum's component library and the flexibility of query-index.json for dynamic content.
Authors work in familiar tools while developers build sophisticated experiences. Everyone wins - especially your users who get fast, accessible, professional interfaces that work everywhere, with Adobe's design language and tested components.
Current Status
The Spectrum Card component is production-ready with:
✅ Numbered Slide Badges - Visual hierarchy indicators✅ Modal Overlay System - In-page content display✅ Full Content Loading - Fetches .plain.html content✅ Professional Styling - Adobe Spectrum design✅ Multiple Close Methods - X button, click outside, ESC key✅ Responsive Design - Works across all devices✅ Error Handling - Graceful fallbacks✅ Accessibility - Keyboard and screen reader support
The component successfully demonstrates how to build professional, accessible web components using Adobe's design system while maintaining simplicity and performance.

Speed Up Your Edge Delivery Services Development with a Simple Local Server
Adobe Edge Delivery Services performs brilliantly, but AI assistants struggle with its multi-system workflow - until now. A minimal Node.js development server transforms Adobe Edge Delivery Services development from a slow, cumbersome process into a lightning-fast workflow that makes building and testing blocks with AI assistants feel instant.
Why AI Struggles with Modern EDS Development
Adobe Edge Delivery Services actually offers fast development cycles. The platform itself performs brilliantly. The challenge comes from the development workflow - creating branches, writing content in Google Docs or SharePoint, then coordinating between code, repository, and documents.
This multi-system approach works well for human developers who can mentally juggle these pieces. But it creates an impossible situation for AI assistants. Ask an AI to help debug your EDS block, and it drowns in confusion. It can't see your Google Doc. It can't correlate your branch changes with your SharePoint content. It can't test your code against real data.
The result? Developers work alone, missing out on AI's ability to accelerate development, catch bugs, and suggest improvements. The very workflow that makes EDS powerful for teams makes it impenetrable for AI assistance.
There's a better way.
A Local-First Development Server Changes Everything
I built a simple Node.js server that unifies EDS development into a single, AI-friendly environment. Instead of splitting your workflow across branches, documents, and repositories, everything runs locally. AI assistants can now see your code, test changes instantly, and provide real-time feedback.
The architecture sounds simple because it is. The server checks if a requested file exists locally. If it does, it serves that file. If not, it fetches the file from your production server and passes it through. This local-first, proxy-fallback approach means you can develop individual blocks without juggling multiple systems, and you can obtain resources from EDS Staging or Production -- you choose
You still use branches for version control. You still create documents when needed. But now AI can participate meaningfully in your development process - suggesting code improvements, catching accessibility issues, and debugging problems as they happen.
Here's what makes this approach powerful:
AI-assisted development becomes real when your assistant sees everything in one place. It analyses code, tests changes, and provides intelligent suggestions without getting lost in multiple systems. Save a file and refresh your browser - changes appear immediately. No build process, no deployment wait, no document synchronisation delays. Work on code and content together, test edge cases without switching between systems, and debug with full context available. Server logs show exactly what's happening with each request. Both you and your AI assistant see which files come from local development and which get proxied from production.
Building a Real Block - The Floating Alert Example
Let's walk through building an actual EDS block to see how this workflow transforms development. We'll create a floating alert that appears when users first visit the site.
Start the development server with a simple command:
The server starts immediately, telling you exactly where to find your site:
Create your block structure:
The JavaScript file implements the block's functionality. Modern ES modules work perfectly - no transpilation needed:
The CSS demonstrates modern styling with glassmorphism and smooth animations:
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/blocks/floating-alert/test.html and your block appears instantly. Make a change to the CSS, or get your AI to do it - perhaps adjust the blur effect or change the animation timing. Save the file and refresh. The change appears immediately.
The server logs tell the complete story:
Every request shows whether it's served locally or proxied. When you reference a production asset that doesn't exist locally, the server fetches it automatically:
The Architecture That Makes It Work
The development server's beauty lies in its simplicity. Three core functions handle everything.
MIME type detection ensures proper content handling:
Performance From the Start
Build performance into your development process rather than optimising later:
Testing Without the Overhead
Test keyboard navigation, screen readers, and focus management directly in your local environment. No need to deploy to see if your ARIA labels work correctly. Point any browser at your local server - test Safari's backdrop-filter support or Firefox's module loading without touching production. Browser DevTools show real performance metrics against your local code. Optimise animations, reduce JavaScript execution time, and eliminate layout shifts before deployment -- all with AI assist and test.
Why This Approach Transforms EDS Development
Traditional EDS development spreads across multiple tools - code in your editor, content in Google Docs or SharePoint, branches in Git. Each system works well individually, but AI assistants can't navigate this maze. They need unified context to provide meaningful help.
This development server solves that problem elegantly. It brings everything together in one place where both you and AI can work effectively. No webpack configuration files. No babel presets. No complex synchronisation between systems. Just a simple server that creates a single source of truth for development.
The benefits compound quickly. AI becomes genuinely helpful when it can see your full context. Instead of generic suggestions, it provides specific, actionable improvements based on your actual code and content. Development speed increases dramatically when every save gives instant feedback and AI can catch issues immediately, if it has a browser tool it can read logs. What used to take multiple round trips between systems now happens in seconds. Debug clarity improves when both you and your AI assistant see exactly which files come from where. Mystery behaviour becomes transparent logic that AI can help solve. Code quality rises when AI can test edge cases, suggest accessibility improvements, and spot potential issues before they reach production.
Getting Started Takes Minutes
Get the code from GitHub. Copy server.js to your EDS project root. Add script to package.json: "debug": "node server.js". Update PROXY_HOST to point to your production site. Run npm run debug. Start building with AI assistance.
That's it. No complex setup. No configuration files. No dependencies to manage.
The project includes comprehensive documentation designed for AI assistance that humans find equally valuable. The docs folder contains markdown files covering everything from block architecture standards to debugging techniques:
These documents serve a dual purpose. AI assistants use them to understand EDS patterns, debug issues more effectively, and suggest architecture-compliant solutions. Human developers benefit from the same clear explanations and standards documentation. When you share these docs with your AI assistant, it gains deep context about EDS best practices, testing approaches, and debugging strategies - making its suggestions more relevant and valuable.
Zero Dependencies
The development server has zero external dependencies and uses only Node.js built-in modules:
http - Creates the HTTP server
fs/promises - File system operations
path - Path manipulation utilities
url - URL utilities
fetch - HTTP requests (built-in Node.js 18+)
Requirements: Node.js 18+ (for built-in fetch support)
This zero-dependency approach aligns with the project's philosophy of minimal tooling and maximum performance. The server works with any EDS project structure. It doesn't care about your Git workflow or deployment pipeline. It just serves files and proxies requests, staying out of your way while accelerating your development.
Advanced Patterns and Best Practices
The full documentation includes comprehensive guides in the docs folder. These markdown files cover error handling patterns for robust block development, configuration-driven development for maintainable code, performance optimisation techniques, testing strategies for production-ready blocks, and debug helpers specifically designed for AI assistants.
The documentation structure makes it easy to find what you need. Architecture standards guide your block development. Testing standards ensure production readiness. Debug guides help troubleshoot issues quickly. Each document works for both AI assistants and human developers - share them with your AI for better suggestions, or read them yourself for deeper understanding.
The Future of EDS Development
This approach represents more than just a development server. It bridges the gap between EDS's powerful multi-system architecture and the emerging world of AI-assisted development.
As AI tools become essential to modern development, workflows need to adapt. The traditional approach of scattered documents, branches, and deployments creates barriers that even the smartest AI can't overcome. This local server removes those barriers while preserving everything that makes EDS powerful.
Fast feedback loops lead to better code. AI assistance leads to fewer bugs. Simple architecture leads to maintainable systems. When these elements work together, development accelerates beyond what either humans or AI could achieve alone.
The next time you build an EDS block, try this approach. Experience the difference between juggling multiple systems and having everything in one place. Feel the power of AI actually understanding your full context and providing meaningful help.
Development should feel effortless. With the right tools, the right approach, and AI by your side, it can be.

Mastering EDS Block Debugging - A Developer's Guide to Edge Delivery Services
Debugging Adobe Edge Delivery Services blocks can feel like solving a puzzle in the dark, but with the right tools and techniques, you can master EDS debugging and build robust, performant blocks.
Why EDS Debugging Feels Different
Debugging Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS) blocks presents unique challenges. Unlike traditional web development, EDS runs content through a sophisticated pipeline: Document Creation → Markdown Conversion → HTML Generation → Block Processing → Final Rendering.
This transformation process creates multiple potential failure points. Traditional debugging approaches often fall short because EDS loads blocks using constructed import paths that can't be easily modified. Content exists in both "served" and "rendered" states with different structures. Timing conflicts arise between EDS processing and custom component logic. Modern web components can clash with EDS's styling system.
Consider this common scenario - you've built a web component that works perfectly in isolation, but when integrated with EDS, users see a blank screen. The browser console shows no errors, the component loads successfully, yet nothing appears. This exact issue has stumped developers for hours. The root cause is often a Shadow DOM versus EDS processing race condition where the component clears the DOM before preserving EDS's critical data-block-status attributes.
Starting with Basic EDS Blocks
Let's begin with a simple EDS block to understand the foundation:
This basic block works, but when issues arise, you have limited visibility into what's happening. Common problems include blocks not loading at all, styling not applying correctly, performance issues with complex blocks, and race conditions with EDS processing.
Adding Debug Capabilities Step by Step
Let's enhance our basic block with debugging capabilities, building up systematically.
Step 1 - Add Basic Logging
Step 2 - Add Error Handling
Step 3 - Add Performance Monitoring
Understanding EDS's Dynamic Loading System
EDS loads blocks using a specific pattern that affects debugging:
This means EDS always calls blocks by their exact filename. You can't simply change the import path to load a different version for testing.
The File Replacement Strategy
To test enhanced or instrumented versions of blocks, you need to use file replacement:
Advanced Debugging with Instrumentation
For complex performance issues and deep debugging, you can create comprehensive instrumentation. This transforms your basic blocks into powerful debugging tools.
Instrumentation wraps your existing functions with monitoring code that captures function execution times, memory usage patterns, DOM mutations and changes, async operation tracking, error patterns and recovery, and complete execution flow.
Instead of manually adding debugging to every function, instrumentation automatically wraps them:
Requesting AI-Assisted Instrumentation
The most effective way to create comprehensive instrumentation is to use AI assistance. Here's the prompt that works with any AI assistant:
Please create comprehensive instrumentation for this EDS project's JavaScript files. I need detailed performance metrics, function call traces, execution timing data, variable scope analysis, memory usage patterns, and program flow information during execution.
Requirements: Create a reusable instrumentation.js file that can wrap any function with performance monitoring. Create instrumented versions of all major JavaScript files. Capture function execution times, memory usage, DOM mutations, async operations. Generate telemetry data in a structured format suitable for analysis. Ensure instrumentation has minimal impact on execution performance.
After creating instrumented versions, you can access detailed performance data:
Browser Console Debug Tools
Set up comprehensive debugging tools in your browser console:
Common Debugging Scenarios
When blocks don't appear, check if the block file exists and loads. Verify CSS class names match EDS conventions. Ensure body.appear class is present. Check for JavaScript errors in the console.
For performance issues, use instrumentation to identify bottlenecks. Monitor memory usage patterns. Check for excessive DOM mutations. Analyse async operation timing.
When dealing with integration conflicts, verify EDS attribute preservation. Check for Shadow DOM styling conflicts. Monitor race conditions between EDS and component processing. Validate error handling and recovery.
Performance Benchmarks
Based on extensive testing, here are performance targets for EDS blocks:
Block Loading: 15-20ms (including CSS/JS loading)
Block Decoration: 1-3ms for simple blocks, 5-15ms for complex blocks
Memory Overhead: <500KB per block
DOM Mutations: <15 mutations per decoration cycle
Real-World Success Story
A recent project involved a complex web component that worked perfectly in isolation but failed completely in EDS. The systematic debugging process worked like this:
Basic debugging confirmed the block was loading. Performance monitoring discovered the decoration was taking 200ms+. Instrumentation showed excessive DOM queries were the bottleneck. Optimisation cached DOM queries, reducing time to 5ms. The component worked flawlessly with 40x performance improvement.
This debugging process, which could have taken days of trial and error, was completed in under two hours.
Getting Started with EDS Debugging
Ready to master EDS debugging? Here's your action plan.
Start with basic debugging - add console logging to your blocks, implement error handling with fallbacks, monitor basic performance metrics, and set up browser console debug tools.
Move to advanced debugging by requesting AI-assisted instrumentation creation, implementing file replacement testing workflow, using comprehensive performance monitoring, and analysing memory usage and optimisation opportunities.
For professional debugging, create systematic debugging workflows, establish performance benchmarks, build automated testing procedures, and document common issues and solutions.
EDS debugging doesn't have to be mysterious. By starting with basic logging and error handling, then progressing to advanced instrumentation, you can build robust, performant blocks that work reliably in production.
The key is understanding EDS's unique architecture and using the right tools for each debugging scenario. Whether you're troubleshooting a simple styling issue or optimising complex performance bottlenecks, systematic debugging approaches will save you time and frustration.
Every expert EDS developer started with basic console.log statements. The difference is building up your debugging toolkit over time and knowing when to use each technique.

The EDS Developer's Dilemma - And How One Framework Solved It
One framework transforms the EDS developer's dilemma by enabling sophisticated components whilst keeping EDS principles intact.
When Simple Meets Sophisticated
Picture this: You're debugging a complex EDS component at 2 AM. You ask your AI assistant for help. It stares back helplessly—it can't see your Google Docs, can't access your SharePoint content, can't connect your branch changes with updates. You're flying solo.
This scenario highlights the fundamental problem holding back EDS development: fragmented workflows that leave AI assistants blind and developers stranded.
Adobe Edge Delivery Services works brilliantly. Perfect Core Web Vitals scores, lightning-fast development, content authors happy with familiar document workflows. The platform itself functions fine.
Adobe Edge Delivery Services promised us a simpler way to build performant websites. No heavy frameworks, no complex build processes—just clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Then Business Requirements Arrive
The challenge appears when business requirements arrive:
"We need data visualisation components""Can we integrate our design system?""The marketing team wants glassmorphism effects""We need complex interactive forms"
Suddenly, you face the EDS developer's dilemma:
Abandon EDS principles and rebuild everything with complex frameworks
Stick with vanilla JavaScript and reinvent every sophisticated component from scratch
Create a messy hybrid that satisfies nobody and breaks constantly
Every option feels like a compromise. Most teams choose vanilla JavaScript and burn weeks rebuilding components that already exist in mature design systems.
Why AI Assistants Can't Help
Traditional EDS workflows scatter development across multiple systems:
Code repositories for logic
Google Docs or SharePoint for assets and content
Staging branches for testing
Production deployments for validation
Ask an AI to debug your EDS block, and it drowns in confusion:
"I can't access your Google Docs content""I can't see your SharePoint files""I can't connect your code changes with document updates""I don't have context about your complete environment"
You end up working alone, missing out on AI's ability to accelerate development, catch bugs early, and suggest architectural improvements. This crushes developer productivity.
What if you didn't have to choose?
Revolutionary Architecture
The webcomponents-with-eds repository didn't just solve these problems—it completely reimagines how EDS development could work.
Born from real-world pain points and 12 months of intensive development, this repository is the result of a unique collaboration between human expertise and AI assistance. Every pattern, every architectural decision, every line of documentation has been refined through actual use, collaborative development with Claude, and the hard-won lessons of building sophisticated EDS applications in production environments.
This document itself embodies that collaboration—distilling practical experience into actionable guidance for developers who refuse to compromise between elegant simplicity and powerful functionality.
The Breakthrough: AI-First Development Architecture with Dual-Directory Separation
Instead of accepting the traditional fragmented workflow, this framework introduced local-first development that enables meaningful AI assistance while providing clear separation between simple and sophisticated components.
The Dual-Directory Innovation
The decision matrix:
Choose simple when vanilla JavaScript works and you want rapid development
Choose sophisticated when you need external libraries, design systems, or complex interactions
Switch approaches as requirements evolve - no architectural rewrites needed
What this unlocks:
AI sees everything: code, content, and data in one environment
Instant feedback: save and refresh - changes appear immediately
Complete context: work on code and content together without system switching
Intelligent assistance: AI can analyse, test, and suggest improvements with full visibility
The development server checks for local files first, then proxies missing assets from production/staging. Simple but revolutionary—it means you can develop components with AI assistance while still accessing real EDS resources.
Real-World Excellence - The Shoelace Card Component
Don't let the term "framework" fool you—this repository delivers production-ready components that push the boundaries of what's possible in EDS.
Sophisticated Glassmorphism UI
The Shoelace Card component demonstrates advanced capabilities:
Multi-layer backdrop blur with professional shadow systems
Immersive modal experiences with full-screen content display
Atomic loading patterns where all images preload in parallel
Smooth animations with staggered card appearances
Technical Excellence
The component includes 130KB of Shoelace dependencies bundled into a single file that loads efficiently and works seamlessly with EDS's loading patterns.
Development Experience Revolution
Solving the 2 AM Problem - From Isolation to Collaboration
Remember that 2 AM debugging scenario? This repository eliminates that isolation entirely.
The 12 months of collaborative patterns refined through real-world use have created something unprecedented: an EDS development environment where AI assistants become true development partners, not helpless observers.
The result? Your AI assistant can:
See your complete codebase including content and configuration
Understand EDS block structure and suggest improvements

Adobe Edge Delivery Services - Full Guide for Devs, Architects and AI
Analysis of Franklin/Edge Delivery Services Document Transformation From Document to HTML: The Transformation Process
To maintain perfect Core Web Vitals scores, all code changes must be integrated into the browser output. The current workflow of patching code is fragile and makes upgrading difficult. Modifying boilerplate code is risky, creates fragile implementations, and can negatively impact Core Web Vitals scores. The blog post explains everything that a developer, architect or AI might want to know. In one page
The Developer, Architect or AI Guide to Edge Delivery Services (EDS): From Document to Website
Introduction
Edge Delivery Services (EDS, formerly known as Franklin or Project Helix) represents a paradigm shift in content management systems. Unlike traditional CMSs that require content authors to adapt to the system's rigid structures, EDS flips this relationship—the system adapts to how authors naturally create content. This comprehensive guide examines how EDS transforms documents into high-performance websites, with a special focus on extending functionality without modifying core files.
This post formatted as markdown can assist in building EDS Components using AI tools like cursor and claude.
Core Philosophy and Requirements
The Content-First Philosophy
At its core, EDS embraces a content-first approach that radically simplifies the authoring process. Content creators work in familiar tools like Documents or Microsoft Word, while the system handles the technical transformation into structured web pages. This separation of concerns allows:
Content authors to focus on writing in familiar environments
Developers to build functionality without disrupting content workflows
Both teams to work simultaneously, accelerating delivery
As a developer working with EDS, understanding this philosophy is crucial—your job isn't to build a website from scratch, but to enhance how documents transform into web experiences.
Development Requirements and Constraints
Before diving into EDS, it's important to understand its core development philosophy and constraints. These aren't limitations but deliberate design choices that promote simplicity, performance, and maintainability:
Modern JavaScript without TypeScript: EDS relies on vanilla JavaScript, avoiding transpilation complexity
Pure CSS without preprocessors: Direct CSS keeps things simple and performant
No build-heavy frameworks: Skip React, Vue, and other frameworks that add complexity
Focus on simplicity and performance: Every decision prioritizes page speed and core web vitals
Clear code organization: Structured, well-documented code is essential
No dependencies and no build steps: Zero build process means faster development and fewer points of failure
These requirements enable EDS to achieve perfect Core Web Vitals scores (100/100/100/100) by eliminating the overhead traditionally associated with modern web development. This approach is increasingly rare but remarkably effective—letting developers focus on solving real problems rather than managing toolchains.
The Document Transformation Journey
Let's follow a document's complete journey from creation to final rendered webpage. This transformation process is at the heart of how EDS works, and understanding it will help you see where and how to extend functionality as a developer.
Stage 1: Document Creation
The journey begins with a content author creating or editing a document in Google Docs (or Microsoft Word). In this familiar environment, authors naturally structure their content using:
Headings and subheadings (H1-H6) to organize information hierarchically
Paragraphs with rich text formatting (bold, italic, underline)
Lists (ordered and unordered) for structured information
Images embedded directly in the document
Links to internal and external resources
Text formatting for emphasis and organization
Authors can also use EDS-specific features:
Section breaks (horizontal rules with ---) to divide content into logical sections
Tables with specific headers to create specialized blocks like "Columns" or "Cards"
Metadata tables with key-value pairs to define page properties for SEO and configuration
For example, a typical document might include a hero section with a main heading, followed by several content sections divided by horizontal rules, and special blocks created with tables.
Stage 2: Document to Markdown Conversion (Server-Side)
When an author presses "Preview" in the Sidekick tool, the transformation begins:
Document Retrieval
EDS accesses the document via Google Docs or SharePoint API
The raw document content is extracted for processing
Structural Analysis
The system analyzes the document structure
It identifies headings, paragraphs, tables, and other elements
Special elements like metadata tables are recognized
Markdown Conversion
The document is systematically converted to Markdown format
Document structure is preserved in Markdown syntax
Tables are specially processed as potential block components
Images are extracted and stored separately
Markdown Storage
The generated Markdown becomes the source of truth for page content
It's stored in the "content bus" for versioning and future access
This separation allows content and code to evolve independently
The Markdown representation serves as an intermediate format that bridges the gap between the document-based authoring experience and web delivery.
Stage 3: Markdown to Initial HTML Generation (Server-Side)
Once the Markdown is prepared, EDS transforms it into basic HTML:
HTML Structure Creation
The server processes the Markdown to generate HTML
A semantic document structure is created with appropriate HTML elements
Headings become <h1> through <h6> elements
Paragraphs become <p> elements
Lists become <ul> or <ol> with nested <li> elements
Metadata Application
Metadata from the metadata table is extracted and applied
Title, description, and other SEO elements are added to the <head>
Open Graph and other social sharing tags are generated
Section Organization
Content is divided into sections based on horizontal rules
Each section is wrapped in a <div class="section"> element
This creates the foundation for the page's visual structure
Block Identification
Tables marked as blocks are converted to <div> elements with appropriate classes
Each block is given a data-block-name attribute for later processing
Block structure is preserved but not yet fully processed
This initial HTML is minimal and lacks styling or interactive features, but it contains all the content and structural information needed for the next steps.
Just a little bit more detail might help.
Table Transformation: From Docs to Div Elements
One of the most important structural transformations in the EDS pipeline involves how tables created in Documents are converted into HTML div elements. Understanding this process is crucial for developers creating blocks that interact with table-based content.
Table Structure in Documents
In Documents, authors create tables with rows and columns. These tables have a semantic structure consisting of:
Table containers
Rows
Cells within rows
Authors often use tables for:
Structured data presentation
Layout organization
Creating specialized block components
The Transformation Process
When an author creates a table in Documents and publishes it through EDS, the following transformation process occurs:
Document Retrieval: The system accesses the Google Doc via API
Table Identification: Tables in the document are identified and parsed
Structure Conversion: The table structure is converted into a nested div structure
How Tables Become Divs
A table structured in Documents:
Will be transformed into this nested div structure in the final HTML:
Recognizing Table-Originated Content in JavaScript
When writing JavaScript for an EDS block that processes table-originated content, you'll need to identify the div structure that was originally a table. Here's how to identify and work with these structures:
Special Considerations for Table Content
Lists in Tables: When an author creates a bulleted or numbered list inside a table cell in Documents, it will be transformed into proper <ul> or <ol> elements inside the div that represents that cell.
Rich Text in Tables: Rich text formatting (bold, italic, links) within table cells is preserved in the resulting divs.
Images in Tables: Images placed inside table cells will be wrapped in <picture> elements within the corresponding div.
Complex Content: For cells containing multiple paragraphs or mixed content types, the structure is preserved within the div representing that cell.
Working with Block-Specific Tables
In EDS, tables are used to define special block components. For example, a table with "Columns" in the first cell would be transformed into a columns block. When writing JavaScript for such blocks, you can rely on the consistent transformation from table to div structure.
By understanding this table-to-div transformation process, you can effectively develop blocks that leverage Document tables as a content creation mechanism while maintaining the performance and flexibility advantages of EDS's div-based rendering approach.Lets us get a bit more specific
Stage 4: Initial HTML Delivery and Browser Processing
The server delivers this basic HTML to the browser, where the transformation continues:
Initial Browser Rendering
The browser receives and parses the HTML
Initial DOM construction begins
Critical CSS (in styles.css) is loaded for basic styling
The page appears in a simplified but structured form
Core Script Loading
Key JavaScript files (aem.js and scripts.js) are loaded
These scripts orchestrate the remaining transformation
DOM Enhancement (Client-Side JavaScript)
The decorateTemplateAndTheme() function applies page-level structure
The decorateSections() function processes each section
The decorateBlocks() function identifies blocks for enhancement
Text nodes are wrapped in appropriate elements with wrapTextNodes()
Links are transformed into buttons where appropriate with decorateButtons()
Block Loading and Processing
Each block is loaded with its CSS and JavaScript
Blocks are processed in order, starting with the first visible section
The loadBlock() function imports block-specific JS and CSS
Each block's decorate() function transforms its DOM
During this phase, the HTML undergoes significant transformation through JavaScript. What starts as basic markup becomes rich, interactive content with proper styling and behavior.
Stage 5: Final DOM Transformation and Rendering
The final stage involves completing the page enhancement with dramatic transformations to the DOM structure:
Block Status Tracking and Wrapper Elements
When examining the browser-rendered DOM, you'll see significant differences from the raw HTML output. For example, a simple block:
<!-- Initial server-rendered HTML -->
Gets transformed into:
Note the key changes:
Addition of data-block-status="loaded" to indicate JavaScript processing is complete
Creation of a parent wrapper element with -wrapper suffix
The DOM structure becomes more complex but more capable
Section Enhancement
Sections undergo similar transformations:
Becomes:
Key transformations include:
Addition of container-specific classes (e.g., hero-container)
Addition of data-section-status="loaded" tracking attribute
Wrapping of general content in a <div class="default-content-wrapper">
Button Styling Enhancement
Simple links written by authors:
Are automatically enhanced into styled buttons:
The system automatically:
Adds appropriate button classes
Adds parent container classes
Enhances with additional attributes like title and target
Media Optimization
Perhaps the most dramatic transformation happens with images. A simple image in a document:
Is transformed into a fully optimized, responsive picture element:
This sophisticated transformation:
Automatically generates multiple image sizes (750px, 2000px)
Creates WebP versions with appropriate fallbacks
Adds responsive breakpoints using media queries
Implements appropriate loading strategy
Preserves image dimensions for layout stability
Applies medium optimization for quality/size balance
Head Section Transformation
The metadata table from the Google Doc:
Is expanded into a comprehensive set of SEO and social sharing tags:
This transformation creates all the metadata needed for proper SEO and social sharing from a simple table in the document.
Resource Loading Optimization
The system automatically applies sophisticated resource loading strategies:
<!-- Script and style loading -->
The hero image loading is specifically optimized for performance:
This change ensures the above-the-fold hero image loads as early as possible for better LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) performance.
Through these multiple transformations, what started as a simple document becomes a fully-featured, high-performance web page with sophisticated optimization techniques applied automatically.
This multi-stage process allows content authors to focus on content while the system handles the technical implementation, creating a clean separation of concerns that is central to EDS's document-based authoring philosophy.
EDS's Three-Phase Loading Strategy
A cornerstone of EDS's performance optimization is its sophisticated three-phase loading strategy, often referred to as E-L-D (Eager-Lazy-Delayed). This strategy is key to maintaining perfect Core Web Vitals scores (100/100/100/100) by carefully managing resource loading.
Phase E (Eager)
Purpose: Loads critical content needed for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)Timeline: Begins immediately on page loadComponents:
First section (typically hero)
Main heading and hero image
Critical CSS in styles.css
Core scripts (aem.js and scripts.js)
Essential functions
It's recommended to keep the aggregate payload before LCP below 100KB for optimal performance. This stringent requirement ensures pages load quickly even on slower connections.
In the code, this is implemented in scripts.js:
Note how it only loads the first section and waits for the first image before proceeding. This targeted approach ensures critical content appears quickly.
Phase L (Lazy)
Purpose: Loads important but non-critical elementsTimeline: Begins after first section is loadedComponents:
Remaining sections
Header and footer components
Non-critical CSS (lazy-styles.css)
Below-the-fold images
Additional fonts
The implementation in scripts.js shows this phased approach:
This function loads all remaining sections, header, footer, and non-critical CSS only after the eager phase completes.
Phase D (Delayed)
Purpose: Handles lowest-priority elementsTimeline: Begins after a 3-second delayComponents:
Analytics
Third-party scripts
Marketing tools
Social widgets
Chat functionality
Anything loaded through delayed.js
This implementation is deceptively simple:
The 3-second delay is crucial—it ensures the main content is fully loaded and interactive before any non-essential scripts run. As the documentation notes: "The delayed phase should be at least three seconds after the LCP event to leave enough time for the rest of the experience to get settled."
This is where teams often add their analytics, personalization, cookie consent, and other secondary functionality:
This E-L-D pattern ensures the most critical content loads quickly for good user experience, while deferring less important resources to maintain performance scores. It's a key reason why EDS sites can consistently achieve perfect Lighthouse scores even while incorporating sophisticated functionality.
Core Components of Edge Delivery Services
The EDS system relies on three core JavaScript files that orchestrate the page loading and enhancement process:
aem.js
This is the foundation of EDS functionality, providing utility functions and core behavior. Without aem.js, your EDS site would be static and unresponsive. Key components include:
Initial Setup: init() function sets up the environment and initializes RUM (Real User Monitoring)
Core Utility Functions: Tools like toClassName(), readBlockConfig(), loadCSS(), and getMetadata()
Image Handling: createOptimizedPicture() creates responsive picture elements
DOM Manipulation: Functions for decorating templates, wrapping text nodes, and processing buttons
Section and Block Handling: Methods for decorating, building, and loading sections and blocks
Performance Monitoring: RUM sampling and tracking for performance analysis
scripts.js
This file orchestrates the page loading process with the three phases described above:
Imports and Utility Functions: Imports useful functions from aem.js and defines additional utilities
Auto Blocking: Functions that programmatically create blocks from content patterns
Loading Phases:
loadEager(): Handles critical elements needed for initial page view
loadLazy(): Manages important but non-critical elements
loadDelayed(): Deals with the lowest-priority elements after a delay
loadEager(): Handles critical elements needed for initial page view
loadLazy(): Manages important but non-critical elements
loadDelayed(): Deals with the lowest-priority elements after a delay
Page Load Orchestration: Coordinates the entire page loading process
delayed.js
A simple file meant for custom code that should load after a delay:
// add delayed functionality here
This file is intentionally minimal, serving as a location where developers can add non-critical functionality without modifying the core files.
Understanding Blocks in EDS
Blocks are the fundamental building units for custom functionality in EDS. They allow documents to include specialized components and layouts while maintaining the content-first philosophy that makes EDS unique.
Block Creation in Documents
Authors create blocks using tables in the document:
The first cell in the first row defines the block type (e.g., "Columns")
The remaining cells provide the block content
For variations, authors can specify options in parentheses: "Columns (wide)"
For example, a columns block in a Google Doc might look like this:
When authors want a variation, they simply add it in parentheses:
The document structure is transformed into HTML, with the table element removed and replaced with appropriate divs and semantic elements.
Autoblocking in Detail
Beyond manual block creation via tables, EDS offers "autoblocking" — a system where the platform automatically applies styling and structure to content from Documents without requiring developers to create custom components for every scenario.
Here's how autoblocking works:
Pattern Recognition: The system identifies common content patterns (like an image followed by a heading)
Automatic Transformation: These patterns are automatically transformed into appropriate blocks
Consistent Styling: The resulting blocks get consistent styling without author intervention
For example, when an author includes an image followed by a heading at the beginning of a document, the autoblocking system might automatically convert this into a hero block without the author needing to create a table.
This is configured in the buildAutoBlocks function in scripts.js:
Autoblocking allows EDS to provide a rich web experience while minimizing the use of tables in documents, which can interrupt the reading flow for authors.
Here are several paragraphs you can add to the EDS (Edge Delivery Services) rules in the knowledge base to explain the bullet point behavior and validation best practices:
Handling Bullet Points in EDS
When working with bullet points in Edge Delivery Services, it's important to understand how Document content is transformed into HTML. EDS will generate different HTML structures for bullet points depending on how the author formats them in the source document.
If bullet points are created as a continuous list in the Document, EDS generates a single <ul> element containing multiple <li> elements. However, if the author includes blank lines between bullet points, EDS will generate separate <ul> elements, each containing a single <li> element. Your code should be flexible enough to handle both structures.
The most robust approach is to query for all <li> elements directly rather than making assumptions about the enclosing <ul> structure. This allows your block to work consistently regardless of the author's formatting choices in the source document.
Block Validation Best Practices
When developing custom blocks for EDS, it's unnecessary to check if a block has the correct class name or structure within your block's JavaScript. The system only calls your block's decorate function for elements that match your block's name. By the time your JavaScript executes, you can be certain you're working with the correct block type.
Validating whether the HTML element is the expected block type (e.g., checking for a class name or specific structure) is redundant and can lead to false negatives if the structure changes. Instead, focus your validation on ensuring the block contains the necessary content for your functionality, such as checking for required rows or data points.
This approach makes your code more concise and less brittle in the face of minor HTML structure changes that might occur as the EDS platform evolves or as authors create content with different formatting choices.
Edge Delivery Services (EDS): Icon System and SVG Handling
Understanding the EDS Icon System
Edge Delivery Services provides an elegant system for incorporating SVG icons into content, allowing authors to work in document formats while the system handles all technical implementation details.
Icon Syntax and Transformation
When content authors place an item name between two colons like :training: in their document, EDS transforms this pattern into structured HTML markup:
<div><span class="icon icon-training"></span></div>
This simple syntax abstracts away HTML complexity server-side during the document-to-HTML conversion process.
Processing Flow
When EDS encounters the icon pattern:
The system identifies the icon name (the text between colons)
It creates a <span> element with two key classes:
icon (indicates this is an SVG icon requiring special handling)
icon-{name} (identifies which specific icon to use, e.g., icon-training)
icon (indicates this is an SVG icon requiring special handling)
icon-{name} (identifies which specific icon to use, e.g., icon-training)
EDS looks for the corresponding SVG file (e.g., training.svg) in the root icons folder
During final rendering, the span is replaced with an image tag pointing to the fully qualified domain:
<img src="https://yourdomain.com/icons/training.svg" alt="Training icon">
Contextual Awareness
EDS demonstrates sophisticated contextual awareness when handling icons. When an icon appears within a content block with specific meaning (like a slide or illustration), the system enhances the markup with additional context:
Benefits for Content Authors and Developers
For Content Authors
Simple syntax (:iconname:) that's easy to remember and use
No need to understand HTML, SVG, or image paths
Focus remains on content creation, not technical implementation
For Developers
Consistent icon implementation across the site
Centralized icon management in a single folder
Semantic HTML with appropriate accessibility attributes
Clean separation between content and presentation
Implementation Notes
When implementing this system in your EDS project:
Create an /icons/ directory at the root of your project, if using boilerplate its there already
Place all SVG icons in this directory, named according to their function (e.g., training.svg)
Ensure SVGs are optimized for web use (remove unnecessary metadata)
Document available icons for content authors to reference
Consider creating an icon library page that displays all available icons
This icon system exemplifies EDS's philosophy of adapting to how authors naturally create content, while maintaining high standards for web performance and accessibility.
Styling Rules
Never apply styling to elements with -container suffix in their class names (e.g. blockname-container, section-container). All styling should be applied to either the -wrapper or the block class itself. This rule is crucial because in EDS:
Container elements (.blockname-container) are structural elements that should never receive styling Wrapper elements (.blockname-wrapper) are the appropriate place for layout and positioning styles. Block elements (.blockname) are for block-specific styling
In our current CSS file.
Block Development in Code
Each block corresponds to a specific folder and files in your project structure:
This structured organization ensures consistency across blocks and makes maintenance easier. Each file serves a specific purpose:
JS file: Contains the block's logic and DOM manipulation
CSS file: Contains block-specific styling
README.md: Documents the block's purpose and configuration options
example.md: Provides simple examples for content authors
demo.md: Shows more comprehensive, real-world usage
When documenting code examples in markdown files, remember to use single backticks (not triple backticks) to enclose code snippets for better compatibility.
A basic block implementation looks like:
CSS for blocks should be isolated to prevent affecting other elements:
EDS passes the block's DOM element to the decorate function, allowing you to transform it as needed. This is where you can add interactivity, fetch data, or reorganize the content.
Block Variations
A powerful feature of EDS blocks is the ability to create variations with minimal additional code. When authors add parenthetical options to a block:
| Columns (dark, wide) |
These options become additional CSS classes:
<div class="columns dark wide">
This allows you to create styling variations through CSS without needing separate JavaScript implementations. For example:
This approach provides tremendous flexibility while keeping the codebase maintainable.
Data Integration with Blocks
If your block requires external data, you should follow consistent patterns for data structure. Here's an example of the expected JSON structure for data integration:
To access EDS pages dynamically, you can use the query-index.json file available in every folder. This powerful feature enables you to create dynamic components that pull content from across your EDS site.
Extending Functionality Without Modifying Core Files
A key challenge in EDS development is how to extend functionality without modifying the core files. Many teams face common requirements that tempt them to directly edit aem.js or scripts.js:
Analytics tracking: Adding Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, or other measurement tools
Personalization: Implementing user-specific content or A/B testing
Cookie acceptance prompts: Meeting regulatory requirements for user consent
GDPR/privacy law compliance: Adding privacy controls and notices
Dynamic content: Pulling content from third-party APIs or from EDS's query-index.json
As the documentation explains: "All of these code elements must be seamlessly integrated into the browser output while maintaining Edge Delivery Services' perfect Core Web Vitals score (100/100/100/100)."
However, modifying core files directly has significant downsides:
Upgrade difficulties: When a new version of aem.js is released, your modifications must be carefully reapplied
Maintenance challenges: Custom modifications become harder to track and maintain
Knowledge transfer: New team members struggle to understand custom core changes
Stability risks: Core file modifications may interact unexpectedly with other features
The Expander Block Pattern - My Approach
Instead of modifying core files, my approach is to create an "expander block"—a normal block that doesn't modify containing content but includes JavaScript that enhances specific elements after the page is rendered.
For example, here's an implementation of a "code-expander" block that enhances <pre><code> elements on the page:
Note the key aspects of this implementation:
Non-invasive approach: It enhances existing elements without modifying core files
Configuration at the top: All configurable values are defined as constants at the top
Thorough documentation: Clear comments explain the purpose and function
Robust error handling: Try/catch blocks prevent failures from breaking the page
Clean modularity: Each function has a single responsibility
Performance consciousness: Uses modern APIs and efficient DOM operations
This pattern allows you to extend functionality without the risks associated with modifying core files.
When developing with EDS, you should follow specific coding standards to ensure your code is maintainable and compatible with future updates:
When writing code that uses console output, remember to precede it with:
This prevents ESLint errors while maintaining the ability to use console logging for debugging purposes.
Common Implementation Challenges and Solutions
Teams developing with EDS often encounter similar challenges. Here are practical solutions to common problems:
Challenge: Analytics Implementation
Problem: Adding analytics without modifying core files.
Solution: Use the delayed.js file for analytics scripts:
Challenge: Dynamic Content from External APIs
Problem: Incorporating content from external services.
When integrating with external data sources or the EDS query-index.json, you should follow a consistent pattern for data structures. Here's an example of the expected JSON structure for data integration:
Solution: Create a specialized block that fetches and formats the content:
Challenge: Cookie Consent Implementation
Problem: Implementing cookie consent without modifying core files.
Solution: Create a cookie-consent block that's included in the template:
Challenge: Personalization
Problem: Implementing personalization without complex frameworks.
Solution: Use local storage for simple personalization:
These practical solutions demonstrate how to implement common requirements within EDS's architectural constraints, without modifying core files or compromising performance.
CSS Best Practices
CSS Injection and Selector Patterns
When developing blocks in EDS, remember that block-specific CSS is injected only when the block is present on the page. This means you don't need to use complex selectors like `:has()` or sibling selectors (`~`, `+`) to target elements when the block is present. Instead, use direct selectors since the CSS will only be loaded when the block exists. For example, if you need to hide the header and footer when your block is present, simply use `header, footer { display: none; }` rather than complex selectors like `header:has(+ .your-block)`. This approach is more maintainable, performs better, and follows the principle that block CSS is scoped to its specific use case.
More CSS Rules
Block Isolation: Every CSS selector in a block's CSS should only apply to that block
Structure with Flexbox/Grid: Modern CSS layout techniques create responsive designs
Mobile-First Approach: Base styles for mobile, then add media queries for larger screens
Consistent Class Naming: Follow patterns like .blockname-element-state
Use CSS Variables: Leverage custom properties for consistent theming
Never Style Container: Don't apply styles directly to .blockname-container
Support Variations: Handle block variations through class combinations
Ensure Responsiveness: Include responsive design for different screen sizes
Key principles to follow:
Simplicity: "Don't let your CSS Selectors become complex and unreadable"
Mobile First: "Your CSS without media query should render a mobile site"
Standard Breakpoints: "Generally use 600px, 900px and 1200px as your breakpoints, all min-width"
Variable-Based Configuration: Use CSS variables for theme colors, spacing, and other configurable values
Block Isolation: Every CSS selector in the .css of a block only applies to the block Container elements in EDS must never have styles applied to them directly. While containers (elements with class names ending in -container) are an expected part of the EDS architecture and serve important structural purposes, applying CSS to these elements violates core EDS principles and creates maintenance challenges. Developers should treat the -container suffix as a signal that an element is for structure only and should remain visually unstyled.
Create properly named elements inside containers instead of styling the containers themselves, when styles need to be applied to large content areas,. For example, rather than styling a blockname-container, create a blockname-area or blockname-content element within it to hold those styles. This pattern maintains clean separation between document structure and visual presentation, making blocks more maintainable and compatible with future EDS updates. A class name blockname is obviously ok, it will not conflict.
Always namespace class names with the block's name to prevent conflicts with other components or global styles. Avoid using generic class names like .header, .content, or .area, which could easily conflict with other blocks or page elements. Instead, follow the pattern of blockname-feature-state (e.g., slideshow-button-active rather than just button-active). This namespacing ensures your styles remain isolated to your block and prevents unexpected behavior when multiple blocks are used on the same page.
EDS JavaScript Best Practices
The JavaScript approach in EDS emphasizes simplicity and performance. It's recommended to adhere to Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide to ensure clean, maintainable code. This widely-adopted style guide provides consistent conventions for variable naming, function declarations, object creation, conditional statements, error handling, and comments.
Key principles:
Keep It Simple: "Frameworks often introduce web performance issues... while trying to address trivial problems"
Modern Features: "Make sure the features you are using are well supported by evergreen browsers"
Configuration at Top: Place all configurable values in a config object at the top
Function Separation: Each function should have a single responsibility
Error Handling: Always include robust error handling
Asynchronous Best Practices: Use async/await for cleaner asynchronous code
Content Structure Best Practices
How content is structured in documents significantly impacts both authoring experience and website performance:
Minimize Blocks: "Blocks are not great for authoring... It is definitely an anti-pattern to have things that are represented natively as default content and put them into a block." Use blocks only when necessary for specialized components.
No Nested Blocks: "Nested blocks are definitely a lot worse" for authoring experience. Keep block structure flat for easier authoring.
Use Full URLs: "Authors (and most humans) often think of a URL as an opaque token... It is always advisable to just let authors work with fully qualified URLs." Don't try to normalize or transform URLs unnecessarily.
Reuse Standards: "The EDS Block Collection is a great source for well designed content models." Don't reinvent the wheel—use existing patterns when possible.
Progressive Enhancement: Start with the simplest possible implementation and enhance as needed, rather than building complex solutions from the start.
Documentation Best Practices
Comprehensive documentation is crucial for block maintainability:
README.md should include:
Purpose and functionality
Configuration options
Usage instructions for authors
Accessibility considerations
Performance impact
Variations and examples
This comprehensive documentation approach ensures both developers and content authors can effectively work with your blocks.
Advanced Techniques
Dynamic Content with Query Index
EDS provides a powerful indexing system for creating dynamic content:
This technique is used in the BlogList block to create dynamic content listings without requiring authors to manually update links.
Auto Blocking
Auto blocking programmatically creates blocks based on content patterns:
This allows you to automatically enhance document patterns without requiring authors to create block tables.
Important note
When creating, or modifying blocks, treat the following files as read-only
Block Examples
To help you get started with EDS development, here are some additional block implementations showcasing different patterns and techniques.
Fortune Cookie Block
A simple block that fetches and displays random quotes:
This block demonstrates fetching JSON data and using it to update content dynamically.
Index Block
A block that builds a table of contents for the page:
The CSS for this block creates a collapsible interface:
This block demonstrates:
Lazy initialization (only building the index when needed)
Dynamic DOM manipulation
Interactive UI elements
Content discovery enhancement
Return To Top Block
A utility block that provides a "scroll to top" button:
}
With accompanying CSS:
This simple utility block demonstrates:
Event handling
Fixed positioning
User experience enhancement
Conditional display based on scroll position
These examples showcase the variety of functionality that can be implemented as blocks in Edge Delivery Services, from content enhancement to user interface improvements, all without modifying core files.
Conclusion
Document-First Content Management
EDS fundamentally reverses the traditional CMS paradigm—instead of forcing authors to adapt to technical constraints, it adapts technical implementation to how authors naturally work. This philosophical shift has profound implications:
Natural Authoring Flow: Authors use familiar tools (Google Docs, Word) without needing to understand web technologies
Separation of Concerns: Content creation and technical implementation remain cleanly separated
Focus on Content: The emphasis stays on the content itself, not on the technical container
As the documentation states: "In an ideal situation the majority of content is authored outside of blocks, as introducing tables into a document makes it harder to read and edit." This content-first approach challenges the component-first mentality that dominates most CMS platforms.
Simplicity Over Complexity
Throughout EDS's implementation, there's a relentless focus on simplicity:
No Build Process: Direct JavaScript and CSS without transpilation or processing
No Dependencies: No external libraries or frameworks to manage
Clear Structure: Well-defined roles for each part of the codebase
Minimal Core: Small, focused JavaScript files that do specific jobs well
This simplicity-first approach delivers tremendous benefits in terms of maintainability, performance, and developer onboarding. Rather than relying on complex toolchains and frameworks, EDS pushes developers to solve problems directly with fundamental web technologies.
Performance by Design
EDS doesn't treat performance as an afterthought or something to be optimized later—it's built into the core architecture:
Three-Phase Loading: The E-L-D pattern ensures critical content loads first
Resource Optimization: Automatic image optimization, responsive images, and format selection
Minimal JavaScript: No heavy frameworks or unnecessary code
Progressive Enhancement: Core content works even before enhancement scripts run
Smart Prioritization: Resources load based on visibility and importance
This architecture consistently delivers perfect Lighthouse scores (100/100/100/100), something many development teams struggle to achieve even with significant optimization efforts.
Empowering Both Authors and Developers
The EDS approach creates a system where:
Authors can focus on creating great content in familiar tools
Developers can build powerful functionality without disrupting content workflows
Both teams can work simultaneously without blocking each other
This balance is rare in content management systems, which tend to prioritize either developer experience or author experience at the expense of the other.
The Expander Pattern for Extension
Perhaps most importantly, EDS promotes the "expander" pattern for extending functionality without modifying core files. This pattern:
Preserves Upgradeability: Core files remain untouched, allowing easy upgrades
Maintains Separation: Custom functionality stays isolated and self-contained
Encourages Modularity: Extensions are organized into distinct, focused blocks
Supports Selective Loading: Extensions can be conditionally applied based on page type
By embracing this pattern, development teams can add sophisticated functionality—analytics, personalization, third-party integrations—without the risk and maintenance burden of modifying core files.
Using this document with AI
This post formatted as markdown can assist in building EDS Components using AI tools like cursor and claude. A shorter version is here https://allabout.network/docs/eds.txt
Add the MD file/ text file (your choice) to docs in cursor settings -> features -> docs.
It will then be able to be referenced during Cursor Chats
If you prefer to use Claude Projects, add the markdown as project knowledge, other IDEs/AI use similar patterns.
Now that you have the AI assistant setup you can create new block by setting up the block structure and populating it with a README.md explaining the functionality to the reader (The AI in this case)As an example we might want to create a markdown block
Create this in /blocks/markdown/README.md then ask the AI to implement it.
No doubt you will make adjustments as the AI does it work, at the end ask it to update/blocks/READMe.md and you will have developer and content author documentation.
The Richness and Versatility of the EDS System
Beyond its streamlined, document-first authoring approach, the EDS system reveals a wealth of advanced features that empower both content authors and developers to build truly complex digital experiences. While at first glance EDS might appear to be tailored primarily for brochureware sites, its robust functionality extends far beyond that.
EDS’s inherent richness is evident in its comprehensive support for features such as headers, global metadata, and folder structures that accommodate varied use cases. The platform also provides overlays and a repo-less architecture, ensuring that even when content requirements evolve or become more intricate, the underlying system remains flexible and capable. These enhancements allow for sophisticated content modeling, dynamic personalization, and advanced SEO configurations without sacrificing the system’s core principles of simplicity and performance.
Additionally, the multi-stage transformation—from document to Markdown, then to optimized HTML with progressive enhancements—coupled with performance-first techniques like the E-L-D (Eager-Lazy-Delayed) loading strategy, exemplifies how EDS delivers rich, interactive experiences while maintaining excellent Core Web Vitals scores. This blend of high-performance optimization and extensive feature support ensures that EDS is not only accessible to non-technical content authors but also provides a deep toolkit for developers seeking to implement custom, high-value functionality.
Universal Editor Support for Adobe Document Authoring
Did you know that Adobe Document Authoring (also known as Dark Alley) for Edge Delivery Services now supports Universal Editor? This exciting new development means you now have two different ways to edit the same content, greatly enhancing flexibility and choice for content creators.
Adobe invites you to try it out at https://da.live/. Keep in mind that this feature is brand new, and Adobe welcomes your feedback and inquiries. Please feel free to share your insights or ask any questions on the AEM Discord at https://discord.com/channels/1131492224371277874/1281270255427256544
In summary, the EDS system is a versatile and feature-rich platform that adapts to complex requirements and diverse content scenarios, making it a powerful solution for modern web delivery. The addition of Universal Editor support further underscores Adobe’s commitment to providing innovative, flexible authoring tools that bridge the gap between technical excellence and user-friendly content creation.
Final Thoughts
Edge Delivery Services represents a refreshing perspective in web development—one that challenges many contemporary assumptions about how websites should be built and managed. By embracing document-based authoring, prioritizing performance by design, and promoting clean separation between content and code, EDS delivers a compelling alternative to traditional CMS platforms.
For developers accustomed to component-based systems and complex build processes, EDS might initially feel constraining. However, these constraints often foster creativity and focus attention on solving real problems rather than managing tooling complexity. The result is websites that are faster, more maintainable, and more author-friendly.
As you implement your own EDS projects, remember these key principles:
Respect the Document: Prioritize the natural flow of document-based authoring
Embrace Constraints: Let EDS's limitations guide you toward simpler, more effective solutions
Performance First: Consider performance implications in every decision
Don't Modify Core Files: Use the expander pattern for extensions
Document Everything: Create comprehensive documentation for blocks and systems
Use AIRBNB style guide: Keep everything clean

This tutorial will guide you through creating a page that Edge Delivery Services will understand and publish on the web without you having to know anything technical.
We'll cover adding images, formatting text, creating links and adding metadata.
We will start with a simple image. Later we will turn this into a ‘hero’ image to really grab a reader’s attention but first…
Add an image
Open a new Google or Word doc and insert an image:
Add some text
Type (or copy and paste) the words around the image, highlight them and choose their size under the Styles dropdown:
Choose Heading 1 for the main page heading, then decorate using Heading 2 and Heading 3 as a hierarchy. Title should be used only for metadata to give the best page structure for search engines - more about this later.
Format the text
You can make text bold, italic, underlined or add bullet points or numbering using the menu at the top of the Google doc or Word:
Different options for text alignment are not available in this version, nor are colours, highlighting or other fonts (except Courier for code, but more of that later).
Create and remove links
If you’d like to link to another webpage, highlight the text you want to link from, click the link icon in the menu, paste in the web address and click 'Apply'.
To remove a link, just highlight it and click the remove link icon:
Add metadata
Finally, and importantly, you need to add some metadata so search engines can understand your page, unless you want it to remain private.
First, create a table using Insert in the menu. Five rows and two columns are enough:
The top row only needs one column, so highlight the whole top row, right click and ‘merge cells’:
Type the following words into the left-hand column. This column is not case sensitive so it doesn’t matter about using capital letters:
Now fill in the right-hand column. This is case-sensitive.
Title
The title of a web page is what appears at the top of the browser window and in search engine results.
Description
This briefly gives further information about the page's contents, with keywords to help search engines categorise the page.
Image
Take a screenshot of the top of your page. This will show up on websites and social media that link to your page.
Author
Self-explanatory. Big yourself up for all the work you’ve put in!
If you follow this guide, you will have a page similar to this example page.
Next time we’ll add a hero image, an index and a back-to-top link to help readers navigate the page.

Introduction
This is a developer's guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. It assumes you have access to a content team to create the content.
I was only joking. Developers can type content.
This tutorial will guide you through creating your blocks and amending the HTML provided by Edge Delivery Services to ensure that the page has the look and feel you need, with coding examples.
Document-based authoring: Edge Delivery Services allows content creators to use familiar tools like Microsoft Word, Google Docs and spreadsheets to author and structure website content, greatly simplifying the process.
All work on a modern website starts with a product owner, a creative person who wants to describe a product or a service. A marketing lead often briefs the product owner. The initial stages usually start with a document, such as Word or Google Docs. The idea is fleshed out and spread around the various teams until everybody is happy with the outcome, messaging and possibly pricing. Sample images and other content are often embedded in the document.
This is then sent to the web content team, which will design a new web page in the site hierarchy or a landing page distinct from the rest of the website. Based on the document's contents, the team may have a design ready or commission one.
The team then copies and pastes the images and text from the document into ‘components’ placed on a ‘template’ within the CMS. Sometimes, they must adjust the copy to fit the page template or component. When changes have been made, the copied and pasted text is placed back into the document as a system of record, and when the web page has been published, the amended document is sent back to the product owner.
This can be a long process. Templates and components need building from a busy dev team; the content team is busy creating the next season's campaigns; the author server is down for routine maintenance. The page may not need much design; it may be design-ready with known components, and you might have Edge Delivery Services (Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services). Good. We will publish the page and step through the processes, adjusting code and styling.
If you do not have Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services installed, the tutorial at https://aem.live is easy to follow.
Beginning with a simple page,
We begin with a simple page, one with a simple title and simple text in Google Docs:
The document above is named Hello World, and the text states, “Hello World From Edge Delivery Services.” Pressing the Preview button transfers the document as HTML to Edge Delivery Services’ content bus, which stores all the content for the eventual web pages. We also have a code bus and an asset bus.
The system then creates a web page.
Not very complicated. Look at the ‘view page source’ code:
What happened?
The title, og:title and twitter:title were created from the first and only line in the text, and the canonical meta tag and the og:url were created from the page's location, formed by domain name/Google Drive location.
Also note that the domain name, in this case, main--allaboutv2--ddttom, was taken from my GitHub branch, as well as the repo name and username. If I created a new branch, say testing, then the domain name would change to testing--allaboutv2--ddttom. The double hyphens -- separate each element. This allows for the testing of new code without breaking the site.
A default image tag for og: image :secure_url, og:image, and Twitter:image has been provided. I must include this default image in my codebase.
The viewport tag has been provided.
Finally, the scripts aem.js and scripts.js are loaded
I have an empty header and footer in my Edge Delivery Services implementations. If one wants these to be present, one can create them in Google Drive, following similar rules to page creation.
The central part of the HTML is a div, followed by a paragraph and text. This is a very simple web page.
But what happens inside the browser?
You will see that the DOM has been adjusted or decorated. This is by design. Edge Delivery Services provides the document in a raw HTML format with known patterns. It is up to the developers to shape the HTML to the end requirements.
Edge Delivery Services has added the HTML to load our CSS through style sheets. Two different patterns are used: styles.css and lazy-style.css. As the document is processed, there are three phases: load-eager, load-page, and load-lazy. Load-eager gets the important “before the fold” stuff and everything needed to get the page set up as quickly as possible; load-page is our standard run-of-the-mill stuff, and load-lazy is for actions that don’t matter, such as animations. Further details will be provided later.
Edge Delivery Services has injected extra scripts into the header, inspecting the raw HTML and deciding which components are used. In our case, we have a header and a footer (though both are blank). Edge Delivery Services has decided that we are using the header and footer components. Edge Delivery Services calls the components ‘blocks,’ adding the CSS to the DOM and running the JS from the same folder.
We are using modern JavaScript techniques in Edge Delivery Services, so the JavaScript is dynamically imported, similar to:
Although it uses a more elegant method.
The JavaScript that comes with the blocks can modify and shape the DOM to match the styling requirements. This is a more advanced technique that will be explained later.
The standard “out of the box” causes the body element to be non-displayed.
You should also note that we are using CSS3 variables in our CSS.
When the page is finally ready to be seen, the class “appear” is applied to the body, and the page becomes visible, thus stopping any flashes of unstyled content.
Semantic header and footer elements are added to the DOM, and wrappers are added as a class to each part. The document is split into sections, only one in this raw case. As the JS runs for each ‘block’ or ‘section’, a data-block-status or a section-block-status class with a value of “loaded” is added; this will help prevent this fraction of the DOM from being handled more than once. It's also a signal to the CSS to action new styles.
The raw line of text is given a <div class=”default-content-wrapper”>
In summary, Edge Delivery Services applies clever conventions on top of the Google/Word Doc, sending minimal HTML to the browser with minimal JavaScript, preferably over an HTTP/3 channel. The JavaScript inspects the HTML and then decorates it by following rules.
We have yet to discover the rules in this document. As there is no configuration in the document, Edge Delivery Services uses a technique known as auto-blocking, which uses ‘smart algorithms’ to understand the author's intent.
What’s this about rules?
Documents need descriptions, titles, etc. Edge Delivery Services tries to provide them, but it would be better if the author had control. In document authoring, we use tables to give rules.
The image above shows our document with a table with two columns. The first row is merged and given the name ‘metadata’. This is the clue to Edge Delivery Services to use this information to adjust the metadata in the HTML.
The left column contains the key phrase, and the right column contains the content. It is traditional to place this table at the foot of the document.
What this metadata does to our HTML
In this HTML, you can see that the title matches our title and that the description is mapped to the description fields in the og:description and twitter:description fields.
A new meta field has been added:
<meta name="keywords" content="Explanatory, web, page, hello, world">
This ability to add rules to the document is critical to creating interesting web pages.
We can add one of the built-in rules. If they contain code and styling, they are called blocks.
Add a block called columns:
Now inspect the view page source. We will look at <main> as we have not changed the metadata.
The block name (columns) is now held within a div element with a class of “columns.” This signals Edge Delivery Services to adjust the DOM, as we will see later.
Although we used a table to define our block, Edge Delivery Services used div elements to separate each cell. We have not gone back in time and are about to style tables. Edge Delivery Services is much more intelligent than that.
Inspecting the rendered DOM, where .…. represents unchanged parts
The image in og:image and og: imagesecure_url has been replaced by the URL for the image in the metadata table, which was the default.
This is our first time using an image in our sample document. You will notice that the doc format has embedded the image into the document, and its original name is lost. Edge Delivery Services creates a unique ID. If the same image is used in multiple places, the ID is the same; it is a hash of the image. You will notice in the HTML a query string: ?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium"
The &#x26; is an HTML entity representing the ampersand character (&). It is inserted in the string to disambiguate the parameters. So, it states that the image should be resized to 1200 pixels in width and served as a progressive jpeg with medium optimisation. Noting this, it is best to provide an image 1200 pixels wide in the image metadata portion of the page. Edge Delivery Services will stretch or shrink your image to fit if you do not.
We will add images to our website and see what Edge Delivery Services offers later.
The CSS for columns has been added to the DOM:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/blocks/columns/columns.css">
At the same time as this decoration, the js in /blocks/columns/columns.js has been imported and executed.
A div with class=”columns-wrapper” has been added to the DOM just before the text.
The original div class = ”columns” has been extended, and new classes have been added: block to inform Edge Delivery Services that this is a block and columns-2-cols to ensure that the correct styling for a two-column div is applied.
The code in column.js does this decoration to transform the raw HTML into a structure that can be styled.
The code above reads the number of divs in the first child and gets the count; it then adds the class with a count derived from the number of children.
The last part of the js looks for picture elements - added at the document level - and decorates the cell with columns-img-col if found.
We are adjusting our document and placing the same image with author details at the top of the page.
I have opened the image options panel in Google Drive to show the placement of alt text and title of this image. I am using the same image as I used in the metadata; we will be able to see the different treatments given to the image by Edge Delivery Services.
Preview the page in the browser.
Inspecting the view page source, from main onwards:
Keep in mind the original og:image metadata:
The HTML provided shows that the picture element was used. The HTML picture element is a powerful tool for creating websites. It allows web developers to specify multiple image sources, ensuring the browser displays the most appropriate image for the user's device and network conditions. Additionally, the picture element provides a fallback mechanism for browsers that do not support it, ensuring users always see some form of the image.
The picture element constructed has the following pattern. I have abstracted the name and shortened the optimisation part to show the layout.
This element has media query conditions that choose the correct width for a mobile device (min-width:600). There are format options to choose WebP (format=webply) or JPEG (format=jpeg). The browser will use this mix to select the correct image for the viewport size and browser capabilities. Finally, there is a fallback - for browsers or tools that need help understanding the picture element (few these days).
Inspecting the HTML code reveals that the same image is used everywhere as the source. The query-string modifier changes what is served to the browser. In our case:./media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpeg
Creating a bio block
We will improve the content team's experience by creating a bio block and writing some JavaScript and CSS to add the image title as a byline for the bio. Search for the meta author if the image does not contain a title.
The first step is to extend the page metadata table to add a new entry: author. Remember, the first column is case-insensitive, but the second is not.
The next step is encapsulating the content in a new bio block and adding the text underneath.
Now, we must style the block and write the JavaScript to decorate it however we want.
Inspect the new block “bio” when looking at the view source page for the raw HTML:
We know that Edge Delivery Services decorates our block when it downloads; looking at the rendered DOM, just the bio block:
We see that the <div class=”bio”> has been replaced with
This allows us to target CSS onto the block.
We will put the bio picture into a circle.
The CSS styling is stored in /blocks/bio/bio.css
Developer Guide to document authoring with Edge Delivery Services
We now want to add some JavaScript to retrieve the alt text or, if not present, read the meta name=author content into a Javascript variable named author, using the variable to enhance the bio element display. The content team no longer need to write the author's name if the metadata is correct, either on the alt or the meta author tag.
Create the new \blocks\bio\bio.js
Previewing the page:
By adding classes, we can create variations of our block. We add extra names in brackets after the block's name. We now make a highlighted variation of the bio block.
We adjust our styling in \blocks\bio\bio.css
As we have the circle (border-radius….), the browser version shows the image with a 2px blue border.
The ability to create many block variations is a powerful feature that can add visual interest and interactivity to a web page. Using styling and JavaScript introspection, unique and engaging blocks can be created.
Here are some examples of how styling and JavaScript introspection can be used to create block variations:
Styling:
Use different colours, fonts and sizes to create various visual styles.
Add borders, shadows and other effects to create depth and dimension.
Use CSS animations and transitions to create dynamic effects.

Creating a hero block
A hero block, frequently called the hero image or hero banner, is crucial at the start of many web pages. This large, page-wide image is strategically positioned to capture the visitor's attention upon landing immediately.
We begin by inserting a table in the document. The first cell is named Hero, and the image is in the second cell.
When we preview this, the hero takes up the entire screen width.
Even when viewed on a mobile device, it looks good.
You may remember that Edge Delivery Services makes a fresh version at different resolutions (picture element, media-query), transforming JPEG into WebP format. This may distort the mobile view by crushing the pixels, giving you a fuzzy appearance.
You may want a different hero on a mobile, which is an editorial decision. The auto-scaled version of the desktop hero sometimes needs to be fixed for a mobile hero.
How do we do this? With a slight modification of the hero table and a bit of JavaScript.
Add a suitable mobile image in a two-cell wide table.
When this is previewed, we are shocked. It is not what we wanted. We ended up with the second image as the hero; the desktop image got lost.
Looking at the rendered HTML:
Add code to the hero block.
As expected, we see two picture elements. We need to decorate this part of the site to combine them. By convention, the first row is the desktop image, and the second is the mobile image.
We add code to the empty \blocks\hero\hero.js
The code performs manipulations on the picture elements. It starts by selecting two <picture> elements: the first one is located inside the first <div> element within an element with the class name hero, and the second one is located inside the second <div> element within the first <div> element of the hero class.
If both these <picture> elements exist, the code proceeds to do the following:
1. It selects the second <source> element from the second <picture> element.
2. If the second <source> element exists, it creates a copy of it.
3. It then checks if the first <picture> element has a second <source> element.
If it does, the code replaces the existing second <source> element in the first <picture> element with the copied <source> element from the second <picture> element.
If it doesn't, the code adds the copied <source> element as a new child of the first <picture> element.
4. Finally, the code removes the document's second <picture> element.
If only one picture element exists, the code does nothing, and the hero still works.
Just a little touch of magic.
See the screenshots below:
Desktop image
Mobile image
Finally, the rendered picture elements - following the adjustments:<div class="hero-wrapper">
The two picture elements have been merged into one.
All this work has been done without affecting the Lighthouse page speed.

A Content Creator’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 2
Author: Cate Nisbet
Back to top
Previously…
In Part 1 of the content creator’s guide we covered adding simple images and text, formatting text and creating links, creating tables and adding metadata to the bottom of the page.
Continuing the tutorial
Here, we will add a large image to the top of a page that will fit any size screen: desktop, laptop, tablet or phone. This will be a ‘hero’ image.
Then I’ll show you how to preview and publish a page, and remove caching from a link.
And how to add useful navigation elements to a page, such as a link back to the top and an index.
Add a hero image
We need a big image at the top of the page that looks good on all screens to grab the reader's attention. To do this, choose an image with enough space around it so you don't lose anything vital when the sides, top and bottom are cropped. The best ratio for an image is 16x9.
Manipulating graphics can be hard if you are new to it. If you are frustrated with it, invest in a suitable tool such as Photoshop.
You can check how your hero will appear on different screens by resizing your browser window. Hover over the side edge of the window until the double-headed arrow appears, then drag the side of the window in. The image will change for a laptop, tablet or phone screen.
To inspect how your page will look, you need to be in ‘preview’ mode, the stage before ‘publish’ when your page goes live to the world.
Preview and publish
If you have Edge Delivery Services set up, you’ll find the button to preview in your toolbar:
It’s essential to use this. After previewing, the options to publish or go back to editing appear:
A red dot indicates the page has been changed since the previous preview or publish.
If you are not publishing yourself, give your doc to someone who will. Allabout.network can do this for you.
Check your image does not appear cropped on any screen size, like this:
Or this:
But with all sides intact, like this:
Remove the cache from links
To link to a page you’ve built, you need to remove the cache info from the end of the web address, otherwise the link will always go to that version of the page and not to any updates.
Caches are useful to speed up the loading of a page, but your page links shouldn’t include them.
To do this, remove the ? (query string) and all the numbers and letters after it from the link address:
https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/content-creator-guide-to-document-authoring-with-edge-delivery-services?nocache=1720353654533
Remove this…
?nocache=1720353654533
Use this…
https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/content-creator-guide-to-document-authoring-with-edge-delivery-services
Add navigation
At allabout.network we have built some useful navigation tools.
To guide a reader back to the top of the page. Add this table to the top:
This will create a Back to top button further down the page:
We have also built an index function.
Just add a single-column table to the top of the page and type ‘index’ into it:
When a reader opens the index, links to all the headings further down the page will appear:
If you follow this guide, you will have a page similar to this example page.
In Part 3, we’ll show you more advanced features, a special font for code examples, and fragments.

A Manager’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services
This is a manager's guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Although Edge Delivery Services is a serverless platform provided and maintained by Adobe, setting up the web hosting, GitHub, CDN (content delivery network) and DNS (domain name system) management requires some technical skill. This post assumes you have access to a technical team to do this with you.
I cover some of the technical aspects in a developer’s guide to Edge Delivery Services post here:

Everything discussed below is identical if you have an existing Word or Google Doc. I will demonstrate importing an existing web page into the system.
Consider a web page such as
The AI Tipping Point: A Consultant's Takeaways from CMS Kickoff 2024 | CMS Critic
If we want to convert this page to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services, we start with the AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) import command. The importer is currently named Franklin Import UI. Franklin is one of the internal product names; another used in the codebase is Helix. Helix refers to the DNA spiral and is used as a meme throughout the documentation and developer “getting started “ site: https://www.aem.live/home
I will continue to use Franklin in this document.
The Edge Delivery Services platform provides the security, scalability, and speed that Adobe offers for websites. Franklin is an individual project that utilizes the Edge Delivery Services content bus.The platform also includes other projects discussed in a separate blog post.
The importer reads the website and recognises the main content, removing the adverts. It then saves the content as a Word document. We edit the document to remove the menu hangover in Word or Google Docs and add a heading title format. That's all we have to do. The document is ready for Edge Delivery Services.
Upload to Google Drive (or SharePoint)
In Google Drive (or SharePoint), we can use the document's normal workflows, plugins, and tools, including translation, AI content enhancement, etc.
When we are ready, press Preview to check the website. Then press Publish, and the web page will be complete and ready for the public.
This technique is called ‘autoblocking’ in the Franklin project. We have not created any components, added fancy tags, or used JavaScript Blocks on the web page. We have taken a basic article with images and turned it into a reasonable web page. Franklin has preserved font emboldening, heading levels, and links and loosely styled them all, which Edge Delivery Services will serve fast.
Franklin understands the document's headings (h1, h2, etc.) and applies these values to the final web page. Franklin also understands bold, italic, and underlining. Franklin understands the Courier font as a code marker and outputs the content raw, without font decoration.
Adding new items
We want to be creative and add new items to our site. Let's explain how that works.
In the GitHub repository, we store individual code and styling in blocks. Your developers take care of these, and your integrator or developer team will provide some additional blocks.
When applying code or styling to a fraction of our web page, one adds a table with the block's name. Let’s add a centreblock:
This text will be centred on the web page. That’s all we have to do. If we wanted to do more, we could have various code and styling blocks, say, accordions, tabs, etc.
Many out-of-the-box blocks are available for Franklin; see Block Collection.Further down the page, you will see Block Party.
One can add teasers, heroes, accordions, tabs, etc. Your developers can create many more.
Metadata
Another feature of Franklin is a special block embedded in the HTML page containing the content and the values to be used as metadata. This block describes the page to external systems and configures the page for the Franklin project.
In each row below, the first column is the metadata keyword, and the second column is the value of the metadata element. We have multiple items: one for the page title, one for the page description; one for an image, and one for a line of extra data. The case is ignored in the first column. The metadata table is typically placed at the foot of the document, though this is not a requirement.
This metadata translates into the final HTML
I will cover metadata in detail in the developer's guide. It's good to know that Franklin covers metadata, that it is easily maintained by the content team, and that it may be used by Google or other indexers. Franklin may also use the metadata to change the page layout.
Preview and publish
Franklin contains a toolbar that allows authorised users to preview or publish pages via the Edge Delivery Services platform.
Pressing Preview allows the content author to see the final page, and then pressing Publish sends the page and its assets—the content, media, and code buses—to the public store.
The publish bus system stores the various elements of the web page in a publicly visible cloud storage system where the code bus provides the final code needed to serve the web page to the public. The Adobe code in the code bus is started by a JavaScript file embedded in the HTML, named aem.js. This orchestrates the delivery and sequencing of the assets, the other code blocks and only the blocks required for the current page. This is a speedy delivery, made faster by a bring-your-own CDN such as Fastly.
The assets bus provides images in a suitably rendered format using HTML picture elements, keeping the website fast and performant on mobile websites.
A properly implemented Edge Delivery Services page should have a great Core Web Vitals or Lighthouse score.Lighthouse performance scoring | Chrome for Developers
The Lighthouse score for this page is below:
The great score 100/100/100/100 comes out of the box. As you add scripts, especially third-party or monitoring scripts, you must continually monitor the performance to ensure the site performs as expected. Adobe provides great tools in the Franklin ecosystem, such as real user monitoring (RUM) and performance checks on GitHub. It helps you ensure you keep world-class speeds. Any Lighthouse score above 80 is at the top of the web.

Introduction
This is a developer's guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. It assumes you have access to a content team to create the content.
I was only joking. Developers can type content.
This tutorial will guide you through creating your blocks and amending the HTML provided by Edge Delivery Services to ensure that the page has the look and feel you need, with coding examples.
Document-based authoring: Edge Delivery Services allows content creators to use familiar tools like Microsoft Word, Google Docs and spreadsheets to author and structure website content, greatly simplifying the process.
All work on a modern website starts with a product owner, a creative person who wants to describe a product or a service. A marketing lead often briefs the product owner. The initial stages usually start with a document, such as Word or Google Docs. The idea is fleshed out and spread around the various teams until everybody is happy with the outcome, messaging and possibly pricing. Sample images and other content are often embedded in the document.
This is then sent to the web content team, which will design a new web page in the site hierarchy or a landing page distinct from the rest of the website. Based on the document's contents, the team may have a design ready or commission one.
The team then copies and pastes the images and text from the document into ‘components’ placed on a ‘template’ within the CMS. Sometimes, they must adjust the copy to fit the page template or component. When changes have been made, the copied and pasted text is placed back into the document as a system of record, and when the web page has been published, the amended document is sent back to the product owner.
This can be a long process. Templates and components need building from a busy dev team; the content team is busy creating the next season's campaigns; the author server is down for routine maintenance. The page may not need much design; it may be design-ready with known components, and you might have Edge Delivery Services (Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services). Good. We will publish the page and step through the processes, adjusting code and styling.
If you do not have Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services installed, the tutorial at https://aem.live is easy to follow.
Beginning with a simple page,
We begin with a simple page, one with a simple title and simple text in Google Docs:
The document above is named Hello World, and the text states, “Hello World From Edge Delivery Services.” Pressing the Preview button transfers the document as HTML to Edge Delivery Services’ content bus, which stores all the content for the eventual web pages. We also have a code bus and an asset bus.
The system then creates a web page.
Not very complicated. Look at the ‘view page source’ code:
What happened?
The title, og:title and twitter:title were created from the first and only line in the text, and the canonical meta tag and the og:url were created from the page's location, formed by domain name/Google Drive location.
Also note that the domain name, in this case, main--allaboutv2--ddttom, was taken from my GitHub branch, as well as the repo name and username. If I created a new branch, say testing, then the domain name would change to testing--allaboutv2--ddttom. The double hyphens -- separate each element. This allows for the testing of new code without breaking the site.
A default image tag for og: image :secure_url, og:image, and Twitter:image has been provided. I must include this default image in my codebase.
The viewport tag has been provided.
Finally, the scripts aem.js and scripts.js are loaded
I have an empty header and footer in my Edge Delivery Services implementations. If one wants these to be present, one can create them in Google Drive, following similar rules to page creation.
The central part of the HTML is a div, followed by a paragraph and text. This is a very simple web page.
But what happens inside the browser?
You will see that the DOM has been adjusted or decorated. This is by design. Edge Delivery Services provides the document in a raw HTML format with known patterns. It is up to the developers to shape the HTML to the end requirements.
Edge Delivery Services has added the HTML to load our CSS through style sheets. Two different patterns are used: styles.css and lazy-style.css. As the document is processed, there are three phases: load-eager, load-page, and load-lazy. Load-eager gets the important “before the fold” stuff and everything needed to get the page set up as quickly as possible; load-page is our standard run-of-the-mill stuff, and load-lazy is for actions that don’t matter, such as animations. Further details will be provided later.
Edge Delivery Services has injected extra scripts into the header, inspecting the raw HTML and deciding which components are used. In our case, we have a header and a footer (though both are blank). Edge Delivery Services has decided that we are using the header and footer components. Edge Delivery Services calls the components ‘blocks,’ adding the CSS to the DOM and running the JS from the same folder.
We are using modern JavaScript techniques in Edge Delivery Services, so the JavaScript is dynamically imported, similar to:
Although it uses a more elegant method.
The JavaScript that comes with the blocks can modify and shape the DOM to match the styling requirements. This is a more advanced technique that will be explained later.
The standard “out of the box” causes the body element to be non-displayed.
You should also note that we are using CSS3 variables in our CSS.
When the page is finally ready to be seen, the class “appear” is applied to the body, and the page becomes visible, thus stopping any flashes of unstyled content.
Semantic header and footer elements are added to the DOM, and wrappers are added as a class to each part. The document is split into sections, only one in this raw case. As the JS runs for each ‘block’ or ‘section’, a data-block-status or a section-block-status class with a value of “loaded” is added; this will help prevent this fraction of the DOM from being handled more than once. It's also a signal to the CSS to action new styles.
The raw line of text is given a <div class=”default-content-wrapper”>
In summary, Edge Delivery Services applies clever conventions on top of the Google/Word Doc, sending minimal HTML to the browser with minimal JavaScript, preferably over an HTTP/3 channel. The JavaScript inspects the HTML and then decorates it by following rules.
We have yet to discover the rules in this document. As there is no configuration in the document, Edge Delivery Services uses a technique known as auto-blocking, which uses ‘smart algorithms’ to understand the author's intent.
What’s this about rules?
Documents need descriptions, titles, etc. Edge Delivery Services tries to provide them, but it would be better if the author had control. In document authoring, we use tables to give rules.
The image above shows our document with a table with two columns. The first row is merged and given the name ‘metadata’. This is the clue to Edge Delivery Services to use this information to adjust the metadata in the HTML.
The left column contains the key phrase, and the right column contains the content. It is traditional to place this table at the foot of the document.
What this metadata does to our HTML
In this HTML, you can see that the title matches our title and that the description is mapped to the description fields in the og:description and twitter:description fields.
A new meta field has been added:
<meta name="keywords" content="Explanatory, web, page, hello, world">
This ability to add rules to the document is critical to creating interesting web pages.
We can add one of the built-in rules. If they contain code and styling, they are called blocks.
Add a block called columns:
Now inspect the view page source. We will look at <main> as we have not changed the metadata.
The block name (columns) is now held within a div element with a class of “columns.” This signals Edge Delivery Services to adjust the DOM, as we will see later.
Although we used a table to define our block, Edge Delivery Services used div elements to separate each cell. We have not gone back in time and are about to style tables. Edge Delivery Services is much more intelligent than that.
Inspecting the rendered DOM, where .…. represents unchanged parts
The image in og:image and og: imagesecure_url has been replaced by the URL for the image in the metadata table, which was the default.
This is our first time using an image in our sample document. You will notice that the doc format has embedded the image into the document, and its original name is lost. Edge Delivery Services creates a unique ID. If the same image is used in multiple places, the ID is the same; it is a hash of the image. You will notice in the HTML a query string: ?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium"
The &#x26; is an HTML entity representing the ampersand character (&). It is inserted in the string to disambiguate the parameters. So, it states that the image should be resized to 1200 pixels in width and served as a progressive jpeg with medium optimisation. Noting this, it is best to provide an image 1200 pixels wide in the image metadata portion of the page. Edge Delivery Services will stretch or shrink your image to fit if you do not.
We will add images to our website and see what Edge Delivery Services offers later.
The CSS for columns has been added to the DOM:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/blocks/columns/columns.css">
At the same time as this decoration, the js in /blocks/columns/columns.js has been imported and executed.
A div with class=”columns-wrapper” has been added to the DOM just before the text.
The original div class = ”columns” has been extended, and new classes have been added: block to inform Edge Delivery Services that this is a block and columns-2-cols to ensure that the correct styling for a two-column div is applied.
The code in column.js does this decoration to transform the raw HTML into a structure that can be styled.
The code above reads the number of divs in the first child and gets the count; it then adds the class with a count derived from the number of children.
The last part of the js looks for picture elements - added at the document level - and decorates the cell with columns-img-col if found.
We are adjusting our document and placing the same image with author details at the top of the page.
I have opened the image options panel in Google Drive to show the placement of alt text and title of this image. I am using the same image as I used in the metadata; we will be able to see the different treatments given to the image by Edge Delivery Services.
Preview the page in the browser.
Inspecting the view page source, from main onwards:
Keep in mind the original og:image metadata:
The HTML provided shows that the picture element was used. The HTML picture element is a powerful tool for creating websites. It allows web developers to specify multiple image sources, ensuring the browser displays the most appropriate image for the user's device and network conditions. Additionally, the picture element provides a fallback mechanism for browsers that do not support it, ensuring users always see some form of the image.
The picture element constructed has the following pattern. I have abstracted the name and shortened the optimisation part to show the layout.
This element has media query conditions that choose the correct width for a mobile device (min-width:600). There are format options to choose WebP (format=webply) or JPEG (format=jpeg). The browser will use this mix to select the correct image for the viewport size and browser capabilities. Finally, there is a fallback - for browsers or tools that need help understanding the picture element (few these days).
Inspecting the HTML code reveals that the same image is used everywhere as the source. The query-string modifier changes what is served to the browser. In our case:./media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpeg
Creating a bio block
We will improve the content team's experience by creating a bio block and writing some JavaScript and CSS to add the image title as a byline for the bio. Search for the meta author if the image does not contain a title.
The first step is to extend the page metadata table to add a new entry: author. Remember, the first column is case-insensitive, but the second is not.
The next step is encapsulating the content in a new bio block and adding the text underneath.
Now, we must style the block and write the JavaScript to decorate it however we want.
Inspect the new block “bio” when looking at the view source page for the raw HTML:
We know that Edge Delivery Services decorates our block when it downloads; looking at the rendered DOM, just the bio block:
We see that the <div class=”bio”> has been replaced with
This allows us to target CSS onto the block.
We will put the bio picture into a circle.
The CSS styling is stored in /blocks/bio/bio.css
Developer Guide to document authoring with Edge Delivery Services
We now want to add some JavaScript to retrieve the alt text or, if not present, read the meta name=author content into a Javascript variable named author, using the variable to enhance the bio element display. The content team no longer need to write the author's name if the metadata is correct, either on the alt or the meta author tag.
Create the new \blocks\bio\bio.js
Previewing the page:
By adding classes, we can create variations of our block. We add extra names in brackets after the block's name. We now make a highlighted variation of the bio block.
We adjust our styling in \blocks\bio\bio.css
As we have the circle (border-radius….), the browser version shows the image with a 2px blue border.
The ability to create many block variations is a powerful feature that can add visual interest and interactivity to a web page. Using styling and JavaScript introspection, unique and engaging blocks can be created.
Here are some examples of how styling and JavaScript introspection can be used to create block variations:
Styling:
Use different colours, fonts and sizes to create various visual styles.
Add borders, shadows and other effects to create depth and dimension.
Use CSS animations and transitions to create dynamic effects.

By combining styling and JavaScript introspection, blocks can be created that are visually appealing and interactive, creating a more engaging and enjoyable user experience.
Creating a hero block
A hero block, frequently called the hero image or hero banner, is crucial at the start of many web pages. This large, page-wide image is strategically positioned to capture the visitor's attention upon landing immediately.
We begin by inserting a table in the document. The first cell is named Hero, and the image is in the second cell.
When we preview this, the hero takes up the entire screen width.
Even when viewed on a mobile device, it looks good.
You may remember that Edge Delivery Services makes a fresh version at different resolutions (picture element, media-query), transforming JPEG into WebP format. This may distort the mobile view by crushing the pixels, giving you a fuzzy appearance.
You may want a different hero on a mobile, which is an editorial decision. The auto-scaled version of the desktop hero sometimes needs to be fixed for a mobile hero.
How do we do this? With a slight modification of the hero table and a bit of JavaScript.
Add a suitable mobile image in a two-cell wide table.
When this is previewed, we are shocked. It is not what we wanted. We ended up with the second image as the hero; the desktop image got lost.
Looking at the rendered HTML:
Add code to the hero block.
As expected, we see two picture elements. We need to decorate this part of the site to combine them. By convention, the first row is the desktop image, and the second is the mobile image.
We add code to the empty \blocks\hero\hero.js
The code performs manipulations on the picture elements. It starts by selecting two <picture> elements: the first one is located inside the first <div> element within an element with the class name hero, and the second one is located inside the second <div> element within the first <div> element of the hero class.
If both these <picture> elements exist, the code proceeds to do the following:
1. It selects the second <source> element from the second <picture> element.
2. If the second <source> element exists, it creates a copy of it.
3. It then checks if the first <picture> element has a second <source> element.
If it does, the code replaces the existing second <source> element in the first <picture> element with the copied <source> element from the second <picture> element.
If it doesn't, the code adds the copied <source> element as a new child of the first <picture> element.
4. Finally, the code removes the document's second <picture> element.
If only one picture element exists, the code does nothing, and the hero still works.
Just a little touch of magic.
See the screenshots below:
Desktop image
Mobile image
Finally, the rendered picture elements - following the adjustments:<div class="hero-wrapper">
The two picture elements have been merged into one.
All this work has been done without affecting the Lighthouse page speed.

A Content Creator’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 3
Author: Cate Nisbet
Back to top
Previously…
In Part 2 of the content creator’s guide we covered hero images, preview and publish, and adding navigation elements to a page.
Continuing the tutorial
Here we will examine autoblocking, a special font, fragments, sections, and other Adobe blocks that come out-of-the-box (don't require a developer).
Blocks and autoblocking
Blocks are used to create different styling on a page.
The simpler a page is, the easier it is to create and edit. With only images and text, Edge Delivery Services will use ‘autoblocking’ to understand how you want those elements to appear, and no developer input is required.
With autoblocking, the first image on the page is the hero, the first H1 heading is the title, and bullets are presented as unordered lists.
Autoblocking treats links surrounded by text as links, but if links are on a line by themselves, they are treated as buttons, like this:
Out of the box you get: cards, columns, fragments, and hero. For more on these and other blocks you can add, provided by Adobe, go to Block Collection (aem.live).
You can control every aspect by creating your blocks, with some dev input.
To get variations on the styling for a block, you can put the block into a table and get your developer to set up different classes in the CSS (style guide).
Courier font
Different text fonts are not available out of the box, except for one: Courier New to show code. With this, the text doesn’t wrap, instead, the line returns are fixed. You can scroll sideways, copy the text, and use it as code.
For example, here is the code for the Return to Top box;
blocks/returntotop/returntotop.js
Fragments
You may want to repeat a piece of content across several pages. In that case, it’s helpful to be able to change that content once and have the update appear on all pages rather than having to change each one individually. For this, we have ‘fragments’.
You don’t need a developer to do this. First, create the content in your drive, then copy the path (the folder structure in your drive, eg /fragments/ddt/proposition) and put it in a 2-row table such as this:
The content will appear wherever you put this table on a page. To publish changes, update the fragment and publish it.
Sections
Whereas a fragment repeats text on different pages, it will inherit the style of the page.
A section, however, repeats code. It is often used to give a different styling to part of a page.
Anything within two lines of 3 dashes --- will have a different coding.
For instance, out-of-the-box sections will have different styling, or even metadata. This all needs developer input.
In a nutshell, you can build simple pages and get them published quickly and easily with allabout.network using Adobe’s Edge Delivery Services with no dev input.
However, if you want extra styling, once a developer has built blocks for you (and DDT Ltd can do this), it’s easy to build and manage the pages how you want.
You will also see there is a Block Party - free, open-source blocks provided by the developer community - at Block Party (aem.live).

AI Optimization - an update
Introduction
Nine months ago I reviewed the Boye & Co CMS Kickoff 2024 in St Petes, Florida
https://cmscritic.com/a-cms-consultants-takeaways-from-cms-kickoff-2024
I also wrote about the dawning of AI Optimization, https://www.linkenavigating-cms-future-mastering-ai-optimization and the landscape has evolved more rapidly than I anticipated.
In summary the original documents stated:
The way we manage online content is changing. Instead of just thinking about how AI can create content, we now need to focus on how AI consumes it. This means big changes in three key areas:
1. Content Strategy:
AI is better at reading and understanding content than creating it. This is because it's still difficult for AI to consistently match a brand's voice and style, and to meet legal and ethical guidelines.
Websites need to be redesigned with AI in mind. This means using structured data, schema markup, and clear organization to make it easier for AI to understand the content.
Content needs to be appealing and useful for both humans and AI.
2. Technical Changes:
Websites need to be built with structured data, using formats like JSON-LD.
Schema markup needs to be improved and expanded to help AI understand the meaning of content.
Websites need to be organized in a logical way that makes sense to both humans and machines.
AI needs to be able to easily access and process website content.
Websites need to work well with AI analytics and search tools.
3. Business Changes:
Companies need to hire people with AI expertise.
Traditional online advertising and user tracking are becoming less effective.
Delivering content through apps is becoming more important.
New job roles are emerging, like "AI Evangelist," to help companies navigate these changes.
The bottom line: To succeed in this new era of AI Optimization (AIO), businesses need to create a digital presence that works for both human users and AI systems.
New feature: llms.txt, helping AI to understand your site
With the introduction of the llms.txt standard and major developments in AI-web interaction, we're seeing a fundamental shift in how digital experiences are created and consumed.
Executive Summary
The integration of AI into web experiences isn't just an optimization strategy anymore—it's a fundamental requirement for digital success. Beyond SEO and AIO, we're now seeing the emergence of "AI-First Architecture" (AIA), where digital experiences are designed with AI systems as primary consumers alongside humans.
The New Frontier: LLMs.txt Standard
Jeremy Howard's proposed llms.txt standard (https://llmstxt.org/#proposal) represents a key moment in AI-web interaction. This development perfectly aligns with the need for structured, AI-readable content, taking it further with a standardized approach.
The proposal argues two points, 1) serving llms.txt from root folders, as a default case and 2) offering markdown (.md) formats of the web pages.
Readers of my previous blog posts will know that I am a fan of Adobe Edge Delivery Services (https://aem.live) , this technology automatically serves .md versions of pages, and it is trivial to add llms.txt.
Key Features of llms.txt:
Simple, standardized format starting with project name and summary
Markdown-based structure for easy AI processing
Integration with existing standards (robots.txt, sitemap.xml)
Support for chunked content processing
URL-to-Markdown conversion capability
Error handling integration through 404 and API failures
LLMs.txt: Comprehensive Implementation Guide
Core Structure and Purpose
The standard leverages Markdown for optimal language model comprehension, with the file located at /llms.txt in a website's root.

When describing a variety of website types in a structured and meaningful way for inclusion in an llms.txt file, it's useful to define categories that capture the website's purpose, functionality, and content focus. Below is my proposed set of categories:
Purpose API-Driven: Websites primarily designed to serve or consume APIs. Content-Driven: Sites focused on delivering informational or editorial content (e.g., blogs, news portals). E-Commerce/Sales-Driven: Websites with the main goal of selling products or services. Document-Driven: Sites that host, manage, and provide access to documents or resources (e.g., research databases, white papers). Informative: Platforms aimed at educating or informing users (e.g., encyclopedias, learning hubs). Humorous/Entertainment: Sites created for entertainment, humor, or leisure purposes (e.g., meme sites, online comics).
Functionality Static: Websites with fixed content, typically HTML/CSS-based without dynamic features. Dynamic: Content changes based on user interaction or backend updates. Interactive: Emphasis on user interaction (e.g., quizzes, forms, calculators). Transactional: Sites where users perform transactions (e.g., banking, e-commerce checkout). Community-Driven: Platforms focused on user-generated content or forums (e.g., Reddit, social networks).
Target Audience B2B (Business-to-Business): Websites designed for professional or corporate users. B2C (Business-to-Consumer): Sites catering directly to general consumers. Niche/Interest-Specific: Targeting specialized audiences (e.g., enthusiasts, hobbyists).

Guide to AEMaaCS Development with AI
AEM Development with AI:My Journey with Cline
AEMaaCS Development with AI: My Journey with Cline
After years of working with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), I want to share something exciting that's transforming how I approach development. First, let me be clear - I'm not a traditional developer. While I understand AEM deeply from a technical perspective and have fixed my share of broken instances, I don't typically write components or workflows. My strength lies in understanding how AEM works at its core.
The Evolution of My Approach
I recently embarked on an experiment with AI-assisted development, going through three distinct phases before finding what I consider a game-changing solution. It started with exploring various tools and approaches, but the real breakthrough came when I discovered Cline (formerly known as Claude Dev). I started out with a ‘kitchen-sink’ approach, creating a RAG knowledge base for Edge Delivery Services and cursor IDE, as the internet does not have a huge history for EDS.Kitchen sink approach
https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/developer-guide-to-document-authoring-with-edge-delivery-services-part-8
This technique does not work for pure AEMaaCS -- too much info out there, no need for a RAG.
I then employed a hard-coded strategy where I assigned a distinct domain name following a specific pattern. For instance, "my company name is tom.com", “my content group name is Tom Site - Content” etc. This involved manually creating and maintaining individual settings for each facet, which presented several challenges.This naming convention is specific to this project's setup and is crucial for proper component organization and visibility in the AEM authoring interface.
Firstly, it was time-consuming to set up and manage the structures
Secondly, the hard-coded approach lacked flexibility. If a name or branding changed, I would need to manually update the values. This process was not only tedious but also prone to errors.
Additionally, the hard-coded approach made it difficult to maintain consistency across different platforms and systems. For example, if I wanted to share this with another developer, on another project they would have to input new values
To address these challenges, I decided to adopt a more dynamic and scalable approach. Instead of hard-coding the names, I implemented an AI Strategy where the AI would introspect the code to obtain the values
Overall, transitioning from a hard-coded approach to an introspection system has greatly improved the efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of my content management process, allowing me to work on multiple codebases with multiple developers, with no changes required. This would only work if the AI could scan my directories and read files; Enter CLINE.
Enter Cline
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev
Cline stands out from traditional coding assistants due to its groundbreaking integration with your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and its utilization of Anthropic's advanced "computer use" capabilities. Here's an elaboration of what makes Cline truly special:
AI-Powered Command Line: Cline operates as an AI-driven command-line tool, providing a convenient and accessible interface for developers within their familiar IDE environment. This seamless integration allows you to interact with Cline directly from your code editor, enhancing your workflow and reducing context switching.
Direct Codebase Interaction: Unlike conventional coding assistants that offer generic suggestions based on pre-defined templates or code snippets, Cline leverages Anthropic's sophisticated "computer use" capabilities to engage directly with your codebase. This enables Cline to analyze your code and provide context-aware suggestions, optimizations, and insights tailored to your project's specific needs.
Enhanced Debugging: Cline's ability to interact with your codebase empowers it to assist in debugging. It can identify potential issues, suggest solutions, and even automatically generate test cases to validate code functionality. This not only streamlines the debugging process but also enhances the overall reliability of your code.
Real-Time Feedback: As you code, Cline provides real-time feedback, highlighting potential errors or inefficiencies. This proactive approach helps you identify and address issues early on, preventing them from snowballing into larger problems later in the development cycle.
Language Agnostic: Cline's capabilities extend beyond a specific programming language. It can interact with code written in various languages, making it a versatile tool for developers working on projects involving multiple technologies, such as AEM.
The combination of AI, direct codebase interaction, and real-time feedback makes Cline a powerful and versatile tool that can revolutionize the way developers work. Cline's capabilities are anything but ordinary, providing a cutting-edge solution for enhancing coding efficiency and accuracy.
Cost and Setup
Requires an Anthropic account ($20/month)
Pay-as-you-go pricing (my demo used only 31 cents)
Real-time cost tracking
Integrates with Visual Studio Code/Cursor
The Magic of Proper Prompting
The secret sauce isn't just the tool - it's how you instruct it. I've refined my prompts through multiple iterations to create a system that:
Introspects existing project structures
Generates appropriate configurations
Adapts to project conventions rather than enforcing pre-existing ones
Understands AEM's component patterns
A Practical Example
During a recent demonstration, I created a simple "Hello World" component. The fascinating part wasn't just that it worked, but how it worked:
Generated all necessary files (Java, HTML, XML)
Created comprehensive documentation
Self-reviewed the implementation
Provided debugging insights when things needed adjustment
What's particularly impressive is that this happened with zero manual coding. When issues arose (as they always do in development), the system was capable of self-correction and provided clear explanations of what needed to be fixed.
Beyond Basic Components
The system isn't limited to simple components. I've developed prompts for:
Components
Workflows
Filters
Models
Schedulers
Servlets
Each prompt is engineered to understand and work within AEM's architectural patterns.
Prompt Engineering is Key
Prompt engineering is an art that requires creativity, technical expertise, and a deep understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the large language model (LLM) being used. It's not enough to simply type in a few words and expect the LLM to generate the desired output. Instead, prompts must be carefully crafted to elicit the best possible response.
One of the key challenges in prompt engineering is finding the right balance between specificity and flexibility. On the one hand, prompts need to be specific enough to guide the LLM towards the desired outcome. On the other hand, they must also allow the LLM enough room to use its own creativity and intelligence to come up with unique and surprising solutions.
Another important aspect of prompt engineering is understanding the different types of prompts that can be used. Some prompts are designed to be factual and informative, while others are more creative and exploratory. Some prompts are best suited for tasks that require a high degree of accuracy, while others are better suited for tasks that require more creative thinking.
Finally, it's important to remember that prompt engineering is an iterative process. There is no one-size-fits-all approach that will work for every task. Instead, it's important to experiment with different prompts and see what works best for the specific task at hand.
By following these tips, you can master the art of prompt engineering and unlock the full potential of LLMs.
Looking Forward
The landscape of AI development tools is rapidly evolving. While Cline currently has an advantage due to its computer use capabilities, other tools like Cursor are catching up. Since they're both using Claude under the hood, the differentiator comes down to how they interact with your repository.
Want to Try It?
I'm currently sharing my prompts with other developers for testing and feedback. If you're interested in experimenting with this approach, I'd love to hear your results, especially with real-world implementations.
Final Thoughts
The most exciting part of this journey has been discovering how AI can complement our understanding of AEM rather than replace it. It's not about removing the developer from the equation - it's about amplifying what we can accomplish while maintaining control over the architecture and implementation.
Remember, the goal isn't to replace traditional development practices but to enhance them. Whether you're building simple components or complex workflows, the right combination of AI assistance and human oversight can significantly improve your development workflow.
My Prompt for “Create an AEM Component”
This is just the beginning of what's possible with AI-assisted AEM development. I'm excited to see how these tools evolve and how the community adapts them to solve real-world challenges.

5. Automation of Tasks:
Writing scripts and automating repetitive tasks can streamline the AI prompting process, saving time and resources.
Programming knowledge empowers users to create custom tools and utilities for efficient AI prompt generation.
An Example
I had a function written by an AI Prompt, which basically created a now() date time variable. Attached it to a database object , saved it into the database and read it back
I asked the AI for a test case which would create a dummy database entry, store it, return it and compare it with the input parameters.
All easy??
No, the AI did what it was told, but the now() that it stored was not the same as the now() upon return.Not surprising to a programmer;completely unknown to the AI coding assistant (Cursor);very familiar to an old hand.The AI tried dropping milliseconds off the now(). Then seconds() but it was not possible for the AI to keep up with the drift.
AI Said
I saw it was changing the values, classic cheating -- if the test doesn't work, change the test. Not in my code!!! It was destroying the now() value in my parser.
I Saidin the test we should be able to use a mock now(), ensuring no drift
AI Said
Conclusion:
Understanding programming is a valuable asset for individuals seeking to optimize their AI prompting strategies. By mastering programming fundamentals, AI enthusiasts can enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness of their AI models, unlocking new possibilities in the field of artificial intelligence.

Adobe EDS: Revolutionising Content Management
The new Document Centred Content Management system
In digital publishing, the quest for the ideal content management system (CMS) is ongoing.Content Authors actually dislike CMS systems. The Content team receives original marketing text and fragments in Word/Excel documents from Subject Matter Experts (SME’s), which in regulated environments have been approved by Legal. The content team then are forced to use “components”, and “templates”, created by technicians; using “page properties” and dialog boxes to pull the whole piece together; they have to sub-edit the copy; because it often won’t fit in the constraints of the CMS. They then, often, have to back port the content to the original document format as a system of record. Returning the document to the SME with a link to the final web-page page.
Product Owners dislike CMS systems, especially in regulated industries. They have to get approval for every line of text they place on the web. Regulated industries like Pharmaceuticals, Automobile makers, and Insurers etc are legally bound to the content they publish and the corporations requirement is incredibly strict. One product owner I know of actually asked that the entire CMS be driven by pre-approved excel spreadsheets; however the technicians have built the components and templates around dialog boxes. He too had to use the copy paste methodology.Enter Adobe Franklin/Edge Delivery Services, a system that stands out for its innovative approach to web publishing, promising to redefine efficiency and simplicity in the industry. With the Digital Domain Franklin Accelerator and processes, this system is not just another CMS—it's a game-changer.
What is Adobe Doing?
Adobe Franklin/ Edge Delivery Services is a cutting-edge document based CMS, named in tribute to Rosalind Franklin, whose work was crucial in deciphering DNA's structure. It has undergone a transformation from the "Helix" concept to the current "Edge Delivery Services," signifying its growth from a rudimentary tool to a comprehensive digital content management solution. It has shared all three names in its lifetime, Franklin, Helix and now Edge Delivery services. I’ll continue to call it Franklin for ease. My ease. Sorry Adobe marketing people.
Why This Matters
The significance of Edge Delivery services lies in its serverless architecture, which eliminates the complexities of server management, offering a seamless experience for content creators. It integrates effortlessly with tools that users are already familiar with, making content editing and management as intuitive as using everyday office applications. The addition of AI capabilities further refines content strategy, making EDS a compelling choice for those seeking to simplify their content management processes.
The Impact of EDS Core Technology: aem.js
At the heart of Franklin is aem.js, which is closely integrated with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). This synergy highlights Franklin's commitment to providing a powerful platform that capitalizes on Adobe's strong foothold in the creative and marketing realms.
Weighing the Benefits and Limitations
EDS is designed to deliver content with unparalleled efficiency, addressing the challenges of handling extensive information without compromising performance. It opens up the content management field to a broader audience, enabling more professionals to contribute effectively. However, it's essential to acknowledge that Franklin may not be the one-size-fits-all solution for every scenario, particularly where intricate customization and deep content structuring are paramount.
The Practical Impact and Future Outlook
By enabling direct content creation within tools like MS Word and Excel, EDS eliminates the redundant steps often associated with traditional CMS platforms, and creates performant high speed websites. This streamlined approach simplifies the content management process but also meets the stringent requirements of regulated industries, providing a more direct path to compliance,

Guide to AEMaaCS Development with AI
AEM Development with AI:My Journey with Cline
AEMaaCS Development with AI: My Journey with Cline
After years of working with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), I want to share something exciting that's transforming how I approach development. First, let me be clear - I'm not a traditional developer. While I understand AEM deeply from a technical perspective and have fixed my share of broken instances, I don't typically write components or workflows. My strength lies in understanding how AEM works at its core.
The Evolution of My Approach
I recently embarked on an experiment with AI-assisted development, going through three distinct phases before finding what I consider a game-changing solution. It started with exploring various tools and approaches, but the real breakthrough came when I discovered Cline (formerly known as Claude Dev). I started out with a ‘kitchen-sink’ approach, creating a RAG knowledge base for Edge Delivery Services and cursor IDE, as the internet does not have a huge history for EDS. This technique does not work for pure AEMaaCS -- too much info out there, no need for a RAG.
Originally, I employed a hard-coded strategy where I assigned a distinct domain name following a specific pattern. For instance, "my company name is tom.com", “my content group name is Tom Site - Content” etc. This involved manually creating and maintaining individual settings for each facet, which presented several challenges.This naming convention is specific to this project's setup and is crucial for proper component organization and visibility in the AEM authoring interface.
Firstly, it was time-consuming to set up and manage the structures
Secondly, the hard-coded approach lacked flexibility. If a name or branding changed, I would need to manually update the values This process was not only tedious but also prone to errors.
Additionally, the hard-coded approach made it difficult to maintain consistency across different platforms and systems. For example, if I wanted to share this with another developer, on another project they would have to input new values
To address these challenges, I decided to adopt a more dynamic and scalable approach. Instead of hard-coding the names, I implemented an AI Strategy where the AI would introspect the code to obtain the values
Overall, transitioning from a hard-coded approach to an introspection system has greatly improved the efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of my content management process, allowing me to work on multiple codebases with multiple developers, with no changes required. This would only work if the AI could scan my directories and read files; Enter CLINE.
Enter Cline
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev
What makes Cline special? It's an AI-powered command line tool that integrates directly with your IDE. Unlike traditional coding assistants, Cline leverages Anthropic's computer use capabilities, allowing it to interact directly with your codebase. While the name might be as quirky as "Edge Delivery Services," the capabilities are impressive.
Cost and Setup
Requires an Anthropic account ($20/month)
Pay-as-you-go pricing (my demo used only 31 cents)
Real-time cost tracking
Integrates with Visual Studio Code/Cursor
The Magic of Proper Prompting
The secret sauce isn't just the tool - it's how you instruct it. I've refined my prompts through multiple iterations to create a system that:
Introspects existing project structures
Generates appropriate configurations
Adapts to project conventions rather than enforcing pre-existing ones
Understands AEM's component patterns
A Practical Example
During a recent demonstration, I created a simple "Hello World" component. The fascinating part wasn't just that it worked, but how it worked:
Generated all necessary files (Java, HTML, XML)
Created comprehensive documentation
Self-reviewed the implementation
Provided debugging insights when things needed adjustment
What's particularly impressive is that this happened with zero manual coding. When issues arose (as they always do in development), the system was capable of self-correction and provided clear explanations of what needed to be fixed.
Beyond Basic Components
The system isn't limited to simple components. I've developed prompts for:
Components
Workflows
Filters
And more
Each prompt is engineered to understand and work within AEM's architectural patterns.
Prompt Engineering is Key
One crucial learning: prompt engineering is not simple. While you can get basic results with simple prompts, the real power comes from properly engineered prompts. I've spent significant time learning how to structure these prompts effectively. As I tell my colleagues, it's like the difference between instructing a junior developer with rigid steps versus giving them room to surprise you with their approach.
Looking Forward
The landscape of AI development tools is rapidly evolving. While Cline currently has an advantage due to its computer use capabilities, other tools like Cursor are catching up. Since they're both using Claude under the hood, the differentiator comes down to how they interact with your repository.
Want to Try It?
I'm currently sharing my prompts with other developers for testing and feedback. If you're interested in experimenting with this approach, I'd love to hear your results, especially with real-world implementations.
Final Thoughts
The most exciting part of this journey has been discovering how AI can complement our understanding of AEM rather than replace it. It's not about removing the developer from the equation - it's about amplifying what we can accomplish while maintaining control over the architecture and implementation.
Remember, the goal isn't to replace traditional development practices but to enhance them. Whether you're building simple components or complex workflows, the right combination of AI assistance and human oversight can significantly improve your development workflow.
My Prompt for “Create an AEM Component”
This is just the beginning of what's possible with AI-assisted AEM development. I'm excited to see how these tools evolve and how the community adapts them to solve real-world challenges.

Building the AI-Native Web with EDS, llms.txt
Jeremy Howard's llms.txt is a proposed standard https://llmstxt.org/#proposal for helping LLMs understand and work with websites and new software at inference time, particularly for projects/tools released after an LLM's training cutoff date, it is a better guide to your site than sitemap.xml; it allows the content creator to decorate and enhance the index to your site or API.
This isn't just about technical specifications—it's about creating websites that serve both human readers and AI systems effectively.
Adobe's Edge Delivery Services (EDS) is at the cutting edge of content delivery, staying ahead of the curve by implementing native support for the latest and most innovative standards. This commitment to staying at the forefront of industry trends allows EDS to provide superior service and ensure that its customers have access to the most advanced solutions available.
As a part of my ongoing research, I have looked into the new llms.txt standard, including insights on security best practices. You can read my findings at the following link: https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/creating-an-llms-txt.
Beyond the information provided in that document, this guide will describe the practical aspects of utilizing llms.txt with EDS. By understanding how these elements work together, you can optimize your content delivery strategy and maximize the benefits of using EDS.
Making AI-Ready Content Simple with EDS
The path to AI-optimized content is already built into Edge Delivery Services. Every page on your EDS-powered site automatically has a markdown version—simply append .md to any URL. This native capability, combined with llms.txt implementation, creates a powerful foundation for AI-ready content delivery.
Understanding llms.txt: The Foundation
Think of llms.txt as a digital welcome mat for AI visitors to your website. Just as robots.txt guides crawlers and sitemap.xml directs search engines, llms.txt helps AI systems navigate and comprehend your site's content. The standard's power lies in its dual approach: a root-level llms.txt file and markdown versions of web pages.
The AI-Ready Trifecta: Powered by EDS
Edge Delivery Services makes implementing the three core components of AI-ready content straightforward:
llms.txt at your site's root - easily managed through EDS's content structure
Markdown versions of pages - automatically generated by EDS
Schema.org integration - seamlessly indicating llms.txt support
This combination creates a semantic layer that both humans and AI can navigate with ease, all powered by EDS's robust infrastructure.
Structured Data: Speaking AI's Language
Modern websites need to be bilingual - speaking both human and machine languages. The llms.txt standard can be indicated through simple Schema.org markup:
This structured data helps AI systems identify llms.txt-enabled websites efficiently.
Extending EDS: AI-Native Error Handling
While the llms.txt standard provides a foundation for AI-web interaction, I propose extending Edge Delivery Services' error handling to better serve both human visitors and AI systems.
Here's my proposed enhancement to 404.html
When a 404 error occurs, humans continue to see EDS's clean, user-friendly error page with clear navigation options. Obviously you will have restyled the 404.html to meet your clients aspirations, adding these meta elements is simpleMy proposed extension adds parallel AI-specific handling through two key mechanisms:
A llms-section meta tag that directs AI systems to the llms.txt file for standardized handling instructions
Structured machine-readable error data that provides immediate context and guidance
This proposed enhancement:
Maintains EDS's excellent human user experience
Adds standardized AI guidance
Leverages existing llms.txt implementation
Creates clear paths for both human and AI visitors
Why EDS is Your AI-Ready Platform
Edge Delivery Services isn't just supporting these standards—it's helping define them:
Native markdown support built into the platform
Automatic content optimization for both human and AI consumption
Seamless Schema.org integration
Built-in performance optimization
Global edge presence for faster AI interaction
Implementation Guide with EDS
Starting your AI-ready journey with Edge Delivery Services:
Deploy your content through EDS
Add llms.txt to your root
Leverage automatic markdown versions
Implement standard Schema.org markup
The platform handles the complexity, letting you focus on creating great content.
Key Benefits
Improved AI Understanding: Clear indication of llms.txt support helps AI systems better interpret your content
Standardized Format: Simple, markdown-based structure ensures consistent interpretation
Integration Ready: Works alongside existing standards like robots.txt and sitemap.xml
Error Handling: Built-in support for 404 errors and API failures
Business Impact
Organizations adopting these standards with EDS need to consider:
Hiring AI expertise
Updating content management processes
Implementing structured data strategies
Creating new roles like "AI Evangelist"
Optimizing sites for AI
Bridging Robots.txt and llms.txt: A Unified Approach
The implementation of llms.txt marks an important step toward creating AI-ready websites, but we must carefully consider how this new standard interacts with existing web protocols. For decades, robots.txt has served as the primary guide for web crawlers. Now, it can evolve to create a seamless bridge to AI interaction.
Traditional robots.txt files focus solely on basic crawler access control through simple directives:
However, in an AI-ready website, robots.txt can serve as the first point of contact for both traditional crawlers and sophisticated AI systems. Our proposed enhancement creates a clear hierarchy of machine-readable resources:
This enhanced structure achieves several crucial objectives. It maintains backward compatibility with traditional web crawlers through standard directives, ensuring existing systems continue to function as expected. The new (commented out) AI-Documentation directive creates a clear path for AI systems to discover AI-ready features, acting as a signpost to the llms.txt file. Perhaps most importantly, it explicitly allows access to both the llms.txt file and markdown versions of pages, ensuring AI systems can access these resources even when other content access is restricted.
Think of this enhanced robots.txt as a sophisticated traffic controller for machine visitors. While traditional web crawlers follow familiar disallow rules, AI systems discover paths to richer interaction through the AI-Documentation directive. The explicit allowing of markdown files (/*.md$) ensures AI systems can access clean, structured content optimized for their consumption.
API Errors
You may have an API to serve your EDS as well as the content in your EDS Bus, if you do you should add AI Error handling there too.
API 404 Error Handling Implementation
Server Side Access, provide both
Implementation with Edge Delivery Services
Edge Delivery Services makes implementing this enhanced robots.txt straightforward through a simple process:
First, create your robots.txt file in your project root. Then include your traditional crawler directives, followed by adding the AI-Documentation directive pointing to your llms.txt. Finally, ensure markdown versions are explicitly allowed through the appropriate directives.
This creates a clear hierarchy for machine interactions, where robots.txt provides initial access rules and AI guidance, then AI systems are directed to llms.txt for detailed interaction rules, while markdown versions remain accessible for efficient processing.
The result is what we call a "structured AI interaction pathway." While general crawling might be restricted, AI systems can still access:
The llms.txt file, providing structured guidance about your content
Markdown versions of pages, offering clean, semantic content
Your sitemap, helping understand the overall content structure
The robots.txt architecture naturally supports this hierarchical access control, allowing you to maintain different rules for different types of machine visitors while ensuring your content remains optimally accessible through your chosen channels.
This approach represents a fundamental shift from simple binary access control (allow/disallow) to a more nuanced system where website owners can guide AI systems to interact with their content through structured channels. It's comparable to creating a specialized entrance for AI systems that ensures they interact with your content as intended, while maintaining traditional access patterns for conventional web crawlers.
Looking Ahead
As AI continues to evolve, websites that embrace structured data and semantic markup will be better positioned to serve both human and AI users effectively. Edge Delivery Services provides the ideal platform for this transformation, offering built-in support for the features that define AI-ready content.
When AI searches and agents begin to overtake human use of the web, EDS customers will already be prepared. The question isn't whether to make your content AI-ready, but how quickly you can leverage EDS to get there. This technique is perfect for brand new websites.
Particularly valuable for new projects not in LLM training data
Helps with documentation and library usage
Improving AI-assisted development workflows
Enabling more autonomous AI tool usage
Its early days for llms.txt;It was proposed in September 2024, ChatGPT’s cutoff is October 2023 - Antropic is May 2024; so there is a gap between the standard , the AI’s training and now.
Lars Trieloff – Principal – Adobe | LinkedIn confirms that there are no hits against llms.txt in EDS as of publishing date (Jan 2025); The infancy of generative AI search adoption can be attributed to several factors. These include the need for further technological advancements, user hesitations due to unfamiliarity with the technology, and the time it takes for businesses and individuals to adapt to new search paradigms. AI changes rapidly, faster than humans comprehend, and as this barrier will drop and more users will switch to AI search; EDS helps you get your website ready.
Notes
Suggestions made for robots.txt, meta keywords, and headers are to guide AI.
These suggestions are not part of the official standards.
Monitor the llms.txt specification for updates and adjust implementation accordingly.

Creating an llms.txt File: A Comprehensive Guide
A practical guide for website owners and developers implementing the llms.txt standard for AI content interaction.
Introduction
1. Content Strategy:
AI is better at reading and understanding content than creating it. This is because it's still difficult for AI to consistently match a brand's voice and style, and to meet legal and ethical guidelines.
Websites need to be redesigned with AI in mind. This means using structured data, schema markup, and clear organization to make it easier for AI to understand the content.
Content needs to be appealing and useful for both humans and AI.
2. Technical Changes:
Websites need to be organized in a logical way that makes sense to both humans and machines.
AI needs to be able to easily access and process website content.
Websites need to work well with AI analytics and search tools.
The bottom line: To succeed in this new era of AI Optimization (AIO), businesses need to create a digital presence that works for both human users and AI systems.
New feature: llms.txt, helping AI to understand your site
With the introduction of the llms.txt standard and major developments in AI-web interaction, we're seeing a route to a shift in how digital experiences are created and consumed.
Key Features of llms.txt:
Simple, standardized format starting with project name and summary
Markdown-based structure for easy AI processing
Integration with existing standards (robots.txt, sitemap.xml)
Support for chunked content processing
URL-to-Markdown conversion capability
Error handling integration through 404 and API failures
The llms.txt standard provides a way for websites to communicate with Large Language Models (LLMs) about how their content should be accessed and used. This guide will walk you through creating an effective llms.txt file for your website.
Understanding llms.txt
The llms.txt file serves as a bridge between your website and AI systems, similar to how robots.txt guides search engines. Located at your site's root (e.g., https://example.com/llms.txt), it uses Markdown formatting to provide structured information about:
How LLMs should interact with your content
Which parts of your site are accessible to AI systems
Attribution requirements and usage restrictions
Privacy considerations and data handling guidelines
Currently, it's recommended to create your llms.txt in English, as most LLMs translate content to English before processing.

Conclusion
Creating an effective llms.txt file requires balancing clarity, completeness, and practicality. Regular monitoring and updates ensure your file continues to serve its purpose as AI technology evolves. Remember that while llms.txt operates on a trust basis, clear guidelines and consistent monitoring help encourage compliance.
Extended Guidelines: Beyond the Basics
Creating an effective llms.txt file isn't just about following a format—it's about crafting a clear communication channel between your website and AI systems. Let's explore how to enhance your file with additional features that address common challenges and edge cases.
Guiding AI Behavior
Think of your llms.txt as a friendly but firm doorman for your website. You're not just setting rules; you're creating a framework for productive interaction. Start by clearly defining how AI systems can use your content. For instance, you might allow AI training on your public documentation while reserving your premium content for paying customers only:
Graceful Error Handling
Even the best systems fail sometimes. When they do, your llms.txt should provide clear guidance for recovery. Consider this scenario: an AI assistant is helping a developer with your API documentation, but the relevant page is temporarily unavailable. Instead of leaving the AI to repeatedly hammer your server, provide clear fallback instructions:
The Human Touch
Remember that humans will read your llms.txt too! Create a welcoming section for human visitors that helps them understand the file's purpose while pointing them to more relevant resources. It's like adding a "Welcome, Humans!" mat to your technical doorway:
Tell the AI What kind of website you are hosting
When structuring your llms.txt file, categorize your website by its purpose, functionality, and content focus. This will help define appropriate access rules.
Common categories include:
API-Driven: Technical documentation and service interfaces
Content-Driven: Blogs, news portals, informational sites
E-Commerce: Product and service sales
Document-Driven: Research databases, white papers
Informative: Educational platforms, learning hubs
Entertainment: Media, games, leisure content
Functionality Types
Static: Fixed content, minimal dynamic features
Dynamic: Content changes based on user interaction Interactive - Forms, calculators, user input focused
Transactional: Banking, purchases, data exchange
Community-Driven: User-generated content, forums
Sample definition
Keeping Track of Changes
Version control isn't just about numbers—it's about maintaining a clear history of how your AI interaction policies evolve. Think of it as maintaining a living document that grows with your understanding of AI interactions:
Reporting Systems
Violation Reporting
User submission portal
Automated detection alerts
Internal review process
Response procedures

Long Code Example (with expand/collapse)
This demo showcases the Code Expander block's ability to handle various programming languages, provide syntax highlighting, and offer expand/collapse functionality for long code snippets. Users can interact with the copy buttons and expand/collapse features to experience the full functionality of the block.
Here are the files
CSS, in /blocks/code-expander/code-expander.css
Javascript in /blocks/code-expander/code-expander.js
Explanation
The complex part of the javascript is the highlightsyntax function, This function is designed to provide basic syntax highlighting for different programming languages. It takes two parameters: code (the string of code to highlight) and language (the programming language of the code).
The function uses a switch statement to apply different highlighting rules based on the language:
JavaScript:
Uses regex to match and highlight:
Comments (both single-line and multi-line)
Strings (single quotes, double quotes, and backticks)
Keywords (like 'function', 'var', 'const', etc.)
Booleans and null values
Numbers
JSON:
Highlights:
Strings
Booleans and null
Numbers
HTML:
Escapes special characters (&, <, >)
Highlights:
Strings
Tags
Comments
CSS:
Highlights:
Properties
Color values
Markdown:
Highlights:
Headings
List items
Blockquotes
Inline code
Links
For each language, the function uses regular expressions to find and wrap matching patterns in <span> tags with appropriate class names. This allows for styling these elements differently using CSS. If the language is not recognized, the function returns the original code without any highlighting. This approach provides a simple, lightweight syntax highlighting solution without relying on external libraries. However, it's worth noting that this method may not cover all edge cases or complex language features that more robust syntax highlighting libraries might handle. It is designed for simple documentation, following EDS best practice. Consider developing your own expander for your own use.

Using LLM-Router with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Local Models on Mac
As a Mac user and coding enthusiast, I'm thrilled to share how you can enhance your development workflow using LLM-router to seamlessly integrate Claude 3.5 Sonnet and local Ollama models with the Cursor code editor
The magic is by Keith Coleman , here https://github.com/kcolemangt/llm-router
What is LLM-Router?
LLM-router is a reverse proxy that allows you to switch between different AI language models when using the Cursor code editor. It solves a significant limitation of Cursor: the inability to easily use local models or switch between multiple AI providers.
Why Should Mac Users Care?
Cloud and Local Model Integration: Use Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Ollama models running on your Mac directly within Cursor.
Multi-Provider Flexibility: Easily switch between local models and Claude 3.5 Sonnet without changing Cursor settings.
Improved Privacy: Use local models for sensitive code while leveraging Claude's power for complex tasks.
Setting Up LLM-Router on Mac
We'll walk through the setup process using two scripts: a configuration script and a run script.
Prerequisites
Cursor installed on your Mac
Homebrew package manager, installed on your Mac
Ngrok installed on your Mac
Ollama installed (for local models)
ngrok account (for creating a secure tunnel)
Anthropic API key for Claude 3.5 Sonnet
Step 1: Configuration Script
First, let's create a script to download LLM-router and set up the configuration:
Save this script as configure_llm_router.sh and make it executable:
chmod +x configure_llm_router.sh
Step 2: Run Script
Now, let's create a script to run LLM-router and ngrok:
Save this script as run_llm_router.sh and make it executable:
chmod +x run_llm_router.sh
Using the Scripts
Run the configuration script once to set everything up:
./configure_llm_router.sh
Whenever you want to use LLM-router, run the run script:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
./run_llm_router.sh
Final Configuration in Cursor
Open Cursor preferences.
Navigate to the AI settings.
In the "Override OpenAI Base URL" field, enter the URL provided by the run script (ending with /v1).
Using LLM-Router with Cursor
Now you can use different models by prefixing them in Cursor:
For Claude 3.5 Sonnet: anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229 or just claude-3-sonnet-20240229
For Ollama models: ollama/llama2
Leveraging Claude 3.5 Sonnet
Claude 3.5 Sonnet is Anthropic's most capable model, excelling at a wide range of tasks including:
Complex coding assistance
In-depth code reviews
Architectural design discussions
Debugging and error analysis
Documentation generation
When working on challenging programming tasks or when you need high-quality, nuanced responses, Claude 3.5 Sonnet is an excellent choice.
Conclusion
With LLM-router, you've unlocked a new level of flexibility in your AI-assisted coding workflow. You can now easily switch between local Ollama models for privacy-sensitive tasks and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for complex problem-solving, all within Cursor.
Remember to run the run_llm_router.sh script each time you want to use LLM-router with Cursor. This setup provides a perfect balance of flexibility, performance, and privacy in your coding environment.
Happy coding, fellow Mac enthusiasts!

Local Development with AEM and Universal Editor
Are you an AEM developer looking to create a complete local development environment, including the Universal Editor? Look no further! This guide will walk you through setting up a fully local development environment for AEM with the Universal Editor, allowing you to make and test changes without pushing to GitHub.
A Comprehensive Guide for Mac Users
Introduction
Having a robust local development environment is crucial. This is especially true when working with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) and the new Universal Editor. But let's face it: setting up a local environment that mirrors your production setup can be challenging.
Are you tired of pushing every minor change to GitHub just to see how it looks in the Universal Editor? Do you wish you could test your AEM components locally before committing them? You're not alone, and that's precisely why I have created this guide.
This blog post will walk you through setting up a local development environment for AEM with the Universal Editor. We aim to empower you to make and test changes without pushing to GitHub, allowing faster iteration and more efficient development.
We'll cover everything from setting up a local AEMaaCS instance and configuring the Universal Editor Service to instrumenting your pages for local editing. And because we know that most AEM developers use Macs (let's be honest, they're great for development!), we'll provide Mac-specific scripts to streamline the setup and running processes.
Here's what we'll cover:
The steps needed to set up your local environment
Configuring AEM, the Universal Editor, and Helix CLI
Handling certificates and HTTPS
Instrumenting your pages for local editing
Mac-specific scripts to automate setup and running
By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully functional local AEM development environment with the Universal Editor at your fingertips. So, grab your favourite beverage, fire up your Mac, and let's dive in!
Prerequisites
AEM as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS) SDK
Node.js (version 20 or later)
OpenSSL
Helix CLI
Step 1: Set Up the Local AEMaaCS Instance
Download and install the AEMaaCS SDK.
Deploy your site content and context-aware configuration to the local instance.
Configure AEM to run on HTTPS using the SSL Configuration Wizard:
a. Navigate to AEM Author > Tools > Security > SSL Configuration.
b. In the Store Credentials step:
Enter and confirm a password for the Key Store associated with the SSL-service system user.
Enter and confirm a password for the global Trust Store.
c. In the Key & Certificate step:
Upload the Private Key in DER format.
Upload the associated SSL Certificate in .crt format.
d. In the SSL Connector step:
Verify or update the HTTPS Hostname (should match the Common Name from the certificate).
Verify or update the HTTPS Port.
e. Verify the SSL setup by clicking "Go to HTTPS URL".
Creating a Self-Signed Certificate for AEM
For development purposes, you can create a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL:
Use the resulting localhostprivate.der and localhost.crt files in the SSL Configuration Wizard.
Step 2: Set Up Local Universal Editor Service
Download the universal-editor-service.cjs file from Software Distribution.
Generate a certificate for the Universal Editor Service:
Create a .env file with the following content:
Start the Universal Editor Service:
Step 3: Configure Helix CLI for HTTPS
Update your Helix CLI configuration to run with HTTPS when using aem up.
Step 4: Configure Universal Editor to Load Local Resources
Open CRXDE Lite in your local AEM instance.
Navigate to /conf/global/settings/wcm/franklin/repository.
Set the url property to https://localhost:3000/.
Step 5: Configure AEM to Load Local Resources
The configuration from Step 4 will also apply to AEM, ensuring it loads component-models.json and other resources from localhost.
Step 6: Trust Self-Signed Certificates
Add the self-signed certificates to your browser's trusted certificates.
Add the self-signed certificates to your JVM's truststore.
Step 7: Instrumenting Your Pages
Ensure your pages are instrumented to use the local Universal Editor Service by adding the following meta tag:
<meta name="urn:adobe:aue:config:service" content="https://localhost:8000">
Step 8: Starting the Universal Editor
Open your browser and navigate to https://experience.adobe.com/#/aem/editor.
Enter the URL of your local AEM page.
Mac-Specific Scripts for Configuration and Running
For Mac users, we can simplify the setup and running process with some bash scripts. Add these scripts to your project root and make them executable withchmod +x script_name.sh.
1. Setup Script (setup_local_env.sh)
This script will help you set up the necessary certificates and configuration files.
2. Run Script (run_local_env.sh)
This script will start your local AEM instance, Universal Editor Service, and Helix CLI.
Using the Scripts
Place both scripts in your project root directory.
Make them executable:
Run the setup script once to configure your environment:
Whenever you want to start your local development environment, run:
Remember to add the generated certificates to your system's trust store and JVM trust store as mentioned in the setup script output.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter 404 errors when editing pages, ensure you use the correct URL for the Universal Editor (https://experience.adobe.com/#/aem/editor).
Double-check that all services run on HTTPS and that you've trusted the self-signed certificates.
If you see a "Your connection is not private" error, this is expected when using self-signed certificates. You can proceed by accepting the risk (for development purposes only).
Conclusion
With this setup, you now have a fully local development environment for AEM with the Universal Editor. You can change your components, content, and configurations without pushing to GitHub, allowing faster iteration and testing.
Regularly sync your local changes with your version control system to ensure your team stays up-to-date with your progress.
Happy developing!

Structuring Context for Effective AI Development
Tools like Cursor.ai are changing how we approach coding tasks. One crucial aspect of leveraging AI in development is providing the proper context. This post will explore the three-tiered structure for creating context, ensuring your AI assistant has all the information it needs to be a valuable coding partner.
The Three-Part Context Structure
When working with AI, it's essential to structure your context to provide comprehensive information to the AI. This structure typically consists of Context files, Cursor Rules and The Prompt.
1. Top Level: The Context File
At the highest level, we have the context file. This file is the foundation, providing a broad overview of your project's technical landscape. It typically includes:
The framework you're using
Details about the development environment
Any specific tools, libraries, or techniques that are crucial to the project
This file gives AI a general understanding of the technological ecosystem within which it works.
2. Second Level: .cursorrules (in Cursor your IDE may vary)
The rules file (.cursorrules file in cursor) bridges the general context and specific tasks. It outlines:
Project-specific requirements
Coding standards and best practices
Any constraints or guidelines that need to be followed
This file helps ensure the AI's output aligns with your project's specific needs and standards.
3. Bottom Level: Prompt for the AI
At the most granular level, we have the prompt sent to the AI. This is where you specify:
The exact task you want the AI to perform
Any specific details or parameters for the task
Desired output format or style
This prompt is tailored to each coding task, allowing you to leverage the AI's capabilities for various development needs.
Best Practices for Context Creation
To make the most of this structure, consider the following tips:
Be Comprehensive, Yet Concise: Provide enough detail at each level to give the AI a clear understanding, but avoid overwhelming it with unnecessary information.
Update Regularly: As your project evolves, update your context file and .cursorrules to reflect any changes in your development environment or requirements.
Be Specific in Your Prompts. The more precise your task descriptions, the better the AI can assist you.
Iterate and Refine: Pay attention to the AI's outputs and refine your context and prompts based on the results you receive.
By following this structured approach to context creation in Cursor.ai, you can significantly enhance the effectiveness of AI-assisted development in your projects.Providing clear, relevant information at each level is key, enabling the AI to be a more valuable and accurate coding companion.

https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/the-adapter-pattern-liberating-your-eds-design

The Adapter Pattern - Liberating your EDS Design
Maintaining the balance between system integrity and design flexibility presents a persistent challenge. While Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS) excels at delivering exceptional performance metrics, its standardized approach can sometimes constrain creative expression. Enter the adapter pattern—a classic software design paradigm that offers an elegant solution for accommodating specialized needs without compromising the underlying architecture.
Understanding the Adapter Pattern
The adapter pattern serves as a bridge between incompatible interfaces, allowing them to work together seamlessly. In its essence, the pattern involves three key components:
The Target: The interface you want to work with
The Adaptee: The existing interface that needs adaptation
The Adapter: The intermediary that reconciles the differences
This pattern finds particular relevance in systems where direct modification of core components would compromise upgradability or create maintenance challenges. Rather than altering the foundation, an adapter creates a translation layer that transforms behavior only where needed.
The EDS Implementation Context
Edge Delivery Services represents an ideal candidate for adapter pattern implementation due to its block-based architecture and clear separation of concerns. Each block in EDS can function as a self-contained adapter that affects only the page where it's implemented—a powerful characteristic that allows for targeted modifications without system-wide impact.
Consider, for example, how EDS standardizes icon presentation with these default styles:
These constraints serve a purpose: they provide consistency and prevent layout shifts. However, they can become limiting when projects require more nuanced iconography. Rather than modify these core styles (which would affect the entire system and complicate upgrades), the adapter pattern offers a more surgical approach.
The Adapter in Action - Remove-Icon-Styles Block
To illustrate this pattern concretely, let's examine a specialized block called "remove-icon-styles" that liberates icon dimensions on specific pages. This implementation demonstrates the adapter pattern's effectiveness in addressing targeted needs.
The JavaScript portion establishes the adapter's presence while remaining visually unobtrusive:
Meanwhile, the CSS file creates the adaptation by overriding default styles with higher specificity selectors:
This implementation perfectly embodies the adapter pattern's principle: "Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect." The block doesn't modify the core system but instead creates a translation layer that delivers the required functionality exactly where needed.
Application of Page-Level Adapters
The page-specific nature of EDS blocks creates a uniquely powerful application of the adapter pattern. Unlike global modifications that might introduce unintended consequences across an entire site, these adapters affect only the pages where they're explicitly included.
Consider these strategic applications of page-level adapters:
Feature-Specific Adaptations: Implement specialized behaviors only on pages that showcase particular features or content types.
Campaign-Specific Modifications: Create distinctive visual treatments for marketing campaigns without affecting your core site design.
Documentation Enhancements: Apply specialized formatting and interactive elements exclusively to technical documentation sections.
Contextual Responsiveness: Introduce page-specific responsive behaviors that wouldn't be appropriate site-wide.
Implementation requires minimal effort—simply include a table with the adapter block's name in your Document:
This deceptively simple approach belies the sophisticated design pattern working behind the scenes. When EDS processes this document, it loads the block's CSS and JavaScript only for this specific page, creating a perfectly targeted adaptation.
The Pattern's Broader Applications
While our example focuses on icon styling, the adapter pattern offers vast potential across EDS development. Consider these additional applications:
Typography Adapters: Create blocks that modify font behavior for specific content types without changing your global typography system.
Layout Adapters: Implement specialized grid or positioning behaviors on certain pages while maintaining your standard layout elsewhere.
Interactive Adapters: Add page-specific interactive behaviors that would be inappropriate or unnecessary across your entire site.
Media Adapters: Modify how images, videos, or other media are processed and presented in specialized contexts.
Each adapter follows the same fundamental approach: it maintains compatibility with the core system while providing an interface that meets specialized requirements, limited to exactly where it's needed.
Architectural Advantages of the Adapter Approach
The adapter pattern's application in EDS delivers several architectural advantages:
Maintainability: Core files remain untouched, simplifying upgrades and maintenance.
Granularity: Adaptations apply exactly where needed, preventing unintended consequences.
Encapsulation: Each adapter encapsulates its specific adaptation logic in a self-contained block.
Discoverability: The explicit inclusion of adapter blocks in documents makes adaptations visible and traceable.
Reversibility: Adaptations can be easily removed by simply deleting the block from a document.
These characteristics make the adapter pattern particularly valuable in enterprise environments where system stability and controlled evolution are paramount.
Implementation Considerations
When implementing adapters in your EDS projects, consider these best practices:
Document Your Adapters: Create comprehensive documentation explaining each adapter's purpose and implementation details.
Respect Specificity: Ensure your CSS selectors use appropriate specificity to override defaults without creating cascade conflicts.
Test Thoroughly: Verify that adaptations work as expected and don't create unintended side effects.
Consider Performance: While EDS adapters typically have minimal performance impact, complex adaptations should be evaluated for their effect on page metrics.
Maintain Independence: Design adapters to function independently so they can be combined as needed without conflicts.
Conclusion
The adapter pattern represents a powerful approach to reconciling standardized systems with specialized requirements. In the context of Edge Delivery Services, page-specific adapters offer an elegant solution that maintains system integrity while enabling precise adaptations exactly where needed.
By implementing this pattern through EDS blocks, developers can create sophisticated accommodations for unique design requirements without compromising the platform's performance advantages or future upgradability. It's a perfect example of how classical software design patterns continue to offer elegant solutions to contemporary development challenges.
The next time you encounter a situation where EDS's standardized approach seems limiting, consider whether an adapter block might provide the perfect balance between system integrity and design flexibility. With this pattern in your toolkit, you can extend EDS's capabilities in precisely targeted ways while maintaining its core benefits across your digital experience.

Edge Delivery Services Developer FAQ
Fundamentals
Overview
Edge Delivery Services (EDS) is Adobe's cutting-edge document-based CMS, named in tribute to Rosalind Franklin. It transforms content creation by enabling authors to use tools they're already familiar with, like Google Docs and Microsoft Word. Key features include improved speed through serverless architecture, reduced coding requirements, streamlined content creation, and quicker website updates. This results in enhanced user experience, increased efficiency, and reduced costs.
- #eds #overview #introduction
Architecture
Edge Delivery Services differs from traditional AEM in several key ways: 1) Authors use Google/Word docs to create content directly, 2) Components are pre-built and cached at the edge, eliminating wait times, 3) No bundling of JS/CSS is required, 4) It relies on modern JavaScript and CSS without external libraries like jQuery, 5) Pages are controlled through spreadsheets, redirects, and metadata, 6) Paths in Google Drive/SharePoint control page structure, 7) Developers store code in GitHub with no build to deploy, and 8) Each GitHub branch has a separate live preview with zero pipelines and no publishing delay.
- #architecture #comparison #cms
Development
Getting Started
To create a "Hello World" block: 1) Create a new folder named "helloworld" in your blocks directory, 2) Create two files inside: helloworld.css and helloworld.js with your styling and functionality, 3) In your Google document, insert a one-cell table and add the text 'helloworld' in the cell. Edge Delivery Services will look in the blocks folder and cell-name folder for similarly named JS and CSS files, applying them to the DOM.
- #blocks #hello-world #getting-started
Blocks
In EDS, blocks are components defined by tables in your document. The first cell contains the block name, which signals EDS to load corresponding CSS and JS files from the blocks directory. For example, a table with "columns" in the first cell tells EDS to load /blocks/columns/columns.css and /blocks/columns/columns.js. The JavaScript can then manipulate the DOM to achieve desired styling and functionality. Blocks follow a pattern where the block name becomes a CSS class, and additional classes like "block" are added during the decoration process.
- #blocks #components #development
Block Variations
To create block variations, add additional names in brackets after the block name in your document table. For example, "Bio (highlighted, hide-author)" will add CSS classes "highlighted" and "hide-author" to the block when rendered. These classes can then be targeted in your CSS for styling variations or in JavaScript to modify functionality based on the presence of these classes. This pattern allows content authors to easily mix and match variations without requiring additional code.
- #blocks #variations #customization
JavaScript Patterns
Edge Delivery Services blocks should follow several JavaScript best practices to ensure maintainability and performance. Key recommended patterns include: 1) Configuration Constants: Place all configurable values at the top of your file (e.g., const CONFIG = { ANIMATION_DURATION: 300 }) to improve readability and prevent "magic numbers" scattered throughout the code, 2) ESLint Integration: When debugging with console statements, use // eslint-disable-next-line no-console to avoid linting errors while maintaining good practices, 3) Asynchronous Data Fetching: Implement clean, error-handled async/await functions with try/catch blocks for fetching data, 4) Event Handling: Define handler functions separately for better readability and maintain references for cleanup to prevent memory leaks, 5) DOM Manipulation: Use consistent patterns for updating the UI after data is received. Following these patterns ensures your blocks remain maintainable as your project grows.
- #javascript #patterns #best-practices
CSS Patterns
Edge Delivery Services components should follow established CSS best practices to ensure consistent styling and maintainability. Recommended CSS patterns include: 1) CSS Variables for Theming: Define design tokens through CSS variables (e.g., --heading-color: #202020;) at the root level to create consistent, flexible theming that can be easily updated site-wide, 2) Standard Breakpoints: Use consistent min-width media queries (600px, 900px, 1200px) and follow a mobile-first approach, adding complexity for larger screens rather than removing features for smaller ones, 3) Block Variation Pattern: Structure CSS to support variations defined by content authors in document tables (e.g., .blockname.variation1 selectors). This approach ensures visual consistency across the site, simplifies maintenance, and allows content authors to easily mix and match variations without requiring custom code for each combination.
- #css #patterns #responsive
Debugging
Debugging Edge Delivery Services applications requires understanding how EDS transforms documents. Effective debugging techniques include: 1) Compare Raw vs. Processed HTML: Use "View Page Source" to see the raw HTML sent from the server, then compare it with the decorated DOM (using "Inspect Element") after JavaScript processing to understand what changes EDS makes, 2) Network Inspection: Examine network requests to verify CSS and JS files are loading correctly from the blocks directory, 3) Console Debugging: Add temporary console.log statements in your block JavaScript (prefixed with // eslint-disable-next-line no-console to avoid linting errors), 4) DOM Breakpoints: Set DOM change breakpoints in browser developer tools to pause execution when EDS modifies the document structure, 5) CSS Inspection: Use the browser's style inspector to see which CSS rules are being applied and check for any unexpected cascade issues. Understanding the transformation from raw document to decorated DOM is key to effective debugging in EDS.
- #debugging #troubleshooting #development
Content
Metadata
To add metadata to your EDS pages, create a table with the first row merged and labeled "metadata". In subsequent rows, use the left column for metadata keys (e.g., "title", "description", "image") and the right column for values. EDS will use this information to generate appropriate meta tags in the HTML output, including Open Graph and Twitter card metadata. The table is typically placed at the bottom of the document but can be positioned anywhere. Case is ignored in the first column, and the values in the second column are used exactly as provided.
- #metadata #seo #content-authoring
Images
Edge Delivery Services provides advanced image handling using the HTML picture element. When you add an image to your document, EDS automatically creates responsive versions with different resolutions for various screen sizes. It uses media queries to select the appropriate image size and includes format options (WebP/JPEG) based on browser capabilities. Query string modifiers in the URLs control image width, format, and optimization level. EDS also preserves image metadata like alt text and title, which can be utilized in your blocks through JavaScript.
- #images #responsive #optimization
Fragments
To reuse content across pages, create a "fragments" folder in your Google Drive and add documents containing the reusable content. Then, in your pages, add a fragment block with the path to the fragment (e.g., "want-to-know-more"). When the page is rendered, EDS fetches the raw HTML of the fragment and includes it in the page, where it inherits the styling and context of the main page. Auto-fragments like headers and footers can be automatically included by placing them in the root folder with names like "nav" and "footer".
- #fragments #reusable-content #content-authoring
Styling
Theming
EDS offers three main styling approaches: 1) Default autoblock style: Use styles.css as is without modifications, 2) Themes: Add a theme name to your metadata table (e.g., "article"), which EDS applies as a class to the body element, allowing theme-specific styling, 3) Sections: Divide your page with "---" and add section metadata tables to create distinct sections with their own styling. EDS uses CSS3 with variables for theming and doesn't require bundling, compiling, or transpilation.
- #styling #theming #css #design
Data
Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets in EDS serve multiple purposes: 1) As JSON data sources for websites, where the first row becomes JSON attribute names, 2) For notifications of events from EDS using the query-index sheet, 3) For configuration using sheets like headers, redirects, and config. EDS converts spreadsheets to JSON with a standard format where actual data is in the "data" array and metadata includes total, offset, limit, and type. You can use the fetch API in your blocks to retrieve and use this JSON data.
- #spreadsheets #json #data-sources
Query Index
The query-index spreadsheet acts as a two-way communication tool between EDS and your content. Create a blank sheet named query-index with columns for path, title, image, description, and lastmodified in your Google Drive folder. When you publish pages, EDS automatically populates this sheet with metadata about those pages and publishes it as JSON. You can then use this JSON in your blocks to create dynamic content like blog lists or navigation elements. The sheet provides a complete index of all published content that can be filtered, sorted, and displayed according to your needs.
- #query-index #indexing #dynamic-content
Redirects
To set up redirects in EDS, create a spreadsheet named "redirects" in your Google Drive with two columns: Source and Destination. The Source column contains the original path, and the Destination column contains the new path. When published, EDS creates a redirects.json file that handles URL redirection automatically. This is particularly useful when restructuring your site hierarchy or moving content to new locations while preserving bookmarks and links to the original URLs.
- #redirects #urls #site-structure
Configuration
.helix Folder
The .helix folder (named after a previous code name for EDS) is a special directory that contains configuration files for your EDS project. Files in this folder are not publicly accessible, making it suitable for secrets and configuration. It can contain sheets like "headers" for HTTP headers, "config" for CDN and caching settings, and other configuration options. When you preview a file from this folder, you'll see a "Configuration successfully activated" message instead of a preview, as these settings are applied directly to the EDS environment.
- #configuration #helix #settings
Advanced
SPA Development
To build a SPA with EDS, create a custom block that: 1) Fetches data from query-index.json to get a list of pages, 2) Uses the fetchSlideHtml function to retrieve plain HTML from each page when needed, 3) Creates UI elements for navigation and content display, 4) Implements lazy loading for images and content using Intersection Observer, 5) Handles user interactions like clicking on slides to show detailed content. This approach maintains excellent performance while providing a rich, interactive experience by leveraging EDS's built-in features for content delivery and optimization.
- #spa #javascript #advanced
React Integration
To integrate React with EDS: 1) Set up a new React project using Create React App, 2) Break down your EDS block into modular React components (e.g., main container, individual items, panels), 3) Convert the JavaScript logic from your blocks to use React hooks like useState and useEffect, 4) Create separate CSS files for each component, 5) Build the React application and copy the build output (static folder and index.html) to the root of your EDS repository. The React application can use the same data sources as your EDS blocks, like query-index.json, but provides more flexibility for complex interactions.
- #react #javascript #integration
GitHub Integration
GitHub serves as the code repository for your EDS project and can provide fallback JSON files for configurations. By creating matching JSON files in your GitHub repository (e.g., headers.json, config.json), you establish developer-managed defaults. Content authors can then override these defaults by creating corresponding spreadsheets in Google Drive when needed. This fallback system allows developers to maintain control over critical configurations while giving content authors flexibility to make changes without requiring code deployments.
- #github #integration #configuration
AI
AI Development
To use AI for EDS development: 1) Create a comprehensive context file combining AEM.live documentation, developer guides, and existing repositories, 2) Develop clear rules files with project standards and coding guidelines, 3) Craft detailed prompts for specific tasks, 4) Use tools like Claude (for understanding complex concepts) and Cursor.ai (for code assistance), 5) Implement an iterative process where the AI suggests code, you review it, and then refine your prompts. This approach can significantly accelerate development by automating boilerplate code creation while maintaining human oversight for architecture and implementation decisions.
- #ai #development #automation
Project Setup
Initial Setup
To set up a new EDS project: 1) Create a GitHub repository using the AEM Boilerplate template, 2) Install the AEM CLI globally with npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli, 3) Configure your content source by creating a folder in Google Drive or SharePoint and sharing it with helix@adobe.com, 4) Create an fstab.yaml file in your project root to connect your content source, 5) Install the AEM Sidekick extension and configure it with your project URL. This setup provides the foundation for creating and managing content through familiar tools while leveraging EDS for delivery.
- #setup #project #getting-started
Components
Index Block
The index block is a navigation component that automatically generates a table of contents from your page's heading structure. To implement this component: 1) Create a folder named "index" in your blocks directory with index.css and index.js files, 2) Develop JavaScript that scans the document for all header elements (h1-h6), assigns unique IDs to each header if they don't already have them, and builds a collapsible navigation list, 3) Set up proper indentation based on header levels (h1 headers have no indent, h2 headers are indented once, etc.), 4) Add an expandable/collapsible interface with a clickable arrow, 5) Use event listeners to handle navigation clicks. The index is built using a lazy-loading approach - generating the table of contents only when the user first clicks on the index header - which improves initial page load performance. This component makes longer documents more navigable by providing users with an interactive way to jump directly to specific sections.
- #navigation #index #blocks
Return-to-Top
The returntotop block is a navigation aid that adds a button which appears when users scroll beyond 100 pixels from the top of the page and allows them to quickly return to the beginning of the content. To implement this block: 1) Create a "returntotop" folder in your blocks directory with returntotop.css and returntotop.js files, 2) In your Google Doc, add a returntotop block with customizable button text in the second cell, 3) The JavaScript attaches a scroll event listener to show/hide the button and implements smooth scrolling when clicked. This provides a convenient navigation aid for longer pages while remaining hidden when not needed.
- #navigation #usability #blocks
Blog List
The bloglist block creates a responsive grid display of blog posts or articles by dynamically fetching and filtering content from your site's index. To implement this component: 1) Create a folder named "bloglist" in your blocks directory with bloglist.css and bloglist.js files, 2) Develop JavaScript that fetches blog data from query-index.json, 3) Implement filtering logic based on path or other criteria (e.g., only showing posts with "developer-guide" in the path), 4) Add sorting functionality (typically alphabetical by title or chronological by date), 5) Generate HTML with formatted dates, titles, descriptions, and images in a card-based layout. The CSS should use CSS Grid for a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (typically switching to a single column on mobile devices). This block provides an elegant way to showcase related content without manually updating links when new content is published.
- #blogs #dynamic-content #blocks
Code Expander
The code-expander block is a utility component that automatically enhances all <code> elements on your page with additional functionality. To implement this component: 1) Create a code-expander folder in your blocks directory with code-expander.css and code-expander.js files, 2) Add JavaScript that selects all code elements on the page and wraps them with a container that includes a copy button with a clipboard icon, 3) Implement clipboard functionality using the navigator.clipboard API, 4) Add visual feedback (changing the button text to "Copied!" with a checkmark) when code is successfully copied, 5) Include ARIA attributes for accessibility. Content authors don't need to do anything special - they can continue using the standard <code> element in their content (by applying the Courier font in Google Docs), and the code-expander will automatically enhance these elements without requiring any additional markup. This greatly improves the user experience when sharing code examples or configuration snippets.
- #code #usability #blocks
Performance
Optimization
To optimize EDS performance: 1) Implement lazy loading for images using Intersection Observer, 2) Follow the E-L-D loading pattern (Eager for critical content, Lazy for content loaded as users scroll, Delayed for non-essential scripts), 3) Optimize CSS delivery by separating critical CSS (styles.css) from non-critical CSS (lazy-styles.css), 4) Minimize JavaScript execution time by using efficient DOM manipulation and debouncing event listeners, 5) Test performance using Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools to maintain high scores across all metrics (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO). These practices help maintain the excellent out-of-the-box performance that EDS provides.
- #performance #optimization #best-practices
Deployment
Publishing
The EDS deployment process is straightforward: 1) Commit and push your code changes to GitHub, 2) EDS automatically builds and deploys your changes to the preview environment, 3) Use the AEM Sidekick to preview and publish content changes from Google Drive or SharePoint, 4) For production deployment, configure your CDN to point to your EDS live environment. This workflow separates code deployment (handled through GitHub) from content publishing (managed through the Sidekick), allowing developers and content authors to work independently.

*** New Page ***https://www.aem.live/developer/tutorial
Getting Started – Developer TutorialThis tutorial will get you up-and-running with a new Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) project. In ten to twenty minutes, you will have created your own site and be able to create, preview, and publish your own content, styling, and add new blocks.Prerequisites:You have a GitHub account, and understand Git basics.You have a Google account.You understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.You have Node/npm installed for local development.This tutorial uses macOS, Chrome, and Visual Studio Code as the development environment and the screenshots and instructions reflect that setup. You can use a different operating system, browser, and code editor, but the UI you see and steps you must take may vary accordingly.Get started with the boilerplate repository templateThe fastest and easiest way to get started following AEM best practices is to create your repository using the Boilerplate GitHub repository as a template.https://github.com/adobe/aem-boilerplateClick the Use this template button and select Create a new repository, and select the user org that owns the repositoryWe recommend that the repository is set to public.The only remaining step in GitHub is to install the AEM Code Sync GitHub App on your repository by visiting this link: https://github.com/apps/aem-code-sync/installations/newIn the Repository access settings of the AEM Code Sync App, make sure you select Only select Repositories (not All Repositories). Then select your newly created repository, and click Save.Note: If you are using Github Enterprise with IP filtering, you can add the following IP to the allow list: 3.227.118.73Congratulations! You have a new website running on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/ In the example above that’s https://main--mysite--aemtutorial.aem.page/Link your own content source using Google DriveIn your fork of the Boilerplate GitHub repository, the site points to an existing content source in Google Drive. See this folder for some example content.This content is read-only, but it can be copied into your Google Drive folder to serve as a starting point.To author your own content, create a folder in your own Google Drive and share the folder with the Adobe Experience Manager user (helix@adobe.com).A good way to start authoring your own content is to copy index, nav and footer from the sample content and familiarize yourself with the content structure. nav and footer are not changed frequently in a project and have a special structure. Most of the files in a project look more similar to index.Open the files and copy/paste the entire content into corresponding files in your own Google Drive. You can also download the files via Download All or download individual files. However, remember to convert the downloaded .docx files back into native Google Docs, when you upload them to your folder in your Google Drive.Now that you have your content, you need to connect that content to your GitHub repo. You do this by changing the reference in fstab.yaml in your GitHub repo to the folder you just shared.Copy/paste the folder URL from your Google Drive to fstab.yaml.Be aware that after you make that change, you will see 404 not found errors as your content has not been previewed yet. Please refer to the next section to see how to start authoring and previewing your content. If you copied over index, nav and footer all three of those are separate documents with their own preview and publish cycles, so make sure you preview (and publish) all of them if needed.Commit your changes and you have hooked up your own content source to your website.Preview and publish your contentAfter completing the last step, your new content source is not empty, but no content has been promoted to the preview or live stages, which means your website serves 404s.To preview content, an author has to install the Sidekick Chrome extension. Find the Chrome extension in the Chrome Web Store.After adding the extension to Chrome, don’t forget to pin it, this will make it easier to find it.To set up the Chrome extension, go to your previously shared Google Drive folder and click the extension icon in the browser toolbar and select Add this project.As soon as the extension is installed and your project is added, you are ready to preview and publish your content from your Google Drive.Select all three docs and activate the AEM Sidekick by clicking on your pinned extension. A new toolbar will appear. Clicking the preview or publish buttons will trigger the corresponding operation.Open the index doc and make some changes. Activate the Sidekick by clicking on your pinned extension and then click the Preview button which will trigger the preview operation and open a new tab with the preview rendition of the content.Start developing styling and functionalityTo get started with development, it is easiest to install the AEM Command Line Interface (CLI) and clone your repo locally through using the following.From there change into your project folder and start your local development environment using the following.This opens http://localhost:3000/ and you are ready to make changes.A good place to start is in the blocks folder which is where most of the styling and code lives for a project. Simply make a change in a .css or .js and you should see the changes in your browser immediately.Once you are are ready to push your changes, simply use Git to add, commit, and push and your code to your preview (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.page/) and production (https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.aem.live/) sites.That’s it, you made it! Congrats, your first site is up and running. If you need help in the tutorial, please join our Discord channel or get in touch with us.

The Anatomy of a ProjectThis document describes what a typical project should look like from a code standpoint. Before reading this document, please familiarize yourself with the document Getting Started - Developer Tutorial.Git and GitHubOne of our defining philosophies is that it is easiest to allow users to work with the tools that they are familiar with. The overwhelming majority of developers manage their code in systems based on Git, so it only makes sense to allow developers to work with Git to manage and deploy their code.We are using a buildless approach that runs directly from your GitHub repo. After installing the AEM GitHub bot on your repo, websites are automatically created for each of your branches for content preview on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/ and the production site on https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.live/ for published content.Every resource that you put into your GitHub repo is available on your website, so a file in your GitHub repo on the main branch in /scripts/scripts.js will be available on https://main--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/scripts/scripts.jsThis should be very intuitive. There are few “special” files that Adobe Experience Manager uses to connect the content into your website.We strongly recommend that repos are kept public on GitHub, to foster the community. For a public facing website there really is no need to keep the code hidden, as it is being served to the browsers of your website.Important notes:The combination <branch>--<repo>--<owner> must not exceed 63 characters (including the hyphens/dashes). This is a subdomain name constraint.branch, repo and owner cannot contain --.Configuration FilesThere are some files in your GitHub repo that have a special meaning to AEM and are processed in a special fashion. These files are in the root directory of your repo.The Content Connection: fstab.yamlAs you may have seen in the getting started guide the fstab.yaml file serves as the connection to your Google Drive or SharePoint folders that contain your content. This file is used as an indicator for how the code in your GitHub repo gets combined with the content in your content source.Beyond providing the connection to the content, the fstab.yaml also provides a folder mapping facility that allows you map extensionless “routes” to a given piece of content or static HTML.The Entry Point: head.htmlThe head.html file is the most important extension point to influence the markup of the content. The easiest way to think of it is that this file is injected on the server side as part of the <head> HTML tag and is combined with the metadata coming from the content.The head.html should remain largely unchanged from the boilerplate and there are only very few legitimate reasons in a regular project to make changes. Those include remapping your project to a different base URL for the purposes of exposing your project in a different folder than the root folder of your domain on your CDN or to support legacy browsers which usually require scripts that are not loaded as modules.Adding marketing technology like Adobe Web SDK, Google Tag Manager or other 3rd party scripts to your head.html file is strongly advised against due to performance impacts. Adding inline scripts or styles to head.html is also not advisable for performance and code management reasons, see the section Scripts and Styles below for more information about handling scripts and styles.Please see the following examples.https://github.com/adobe/helix-project-boilerplate/blob/main/head.htmlhttps://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/head.htmlhttps://github.com/adobe/business-website/blob/main/head.htmlNot Found: 404.htmlTo create a custom 404 response, place a 404.html file into the root of your github repository. This will be served on any URL that doesn’t map to an existing resource in either content or code, and replaces the body of the out of the box minimalist 404 response.The 404 can mimic the markup of an existing page including your code for the site, with navigation footers etc., or it can have a completely different appearance.https://github.com/hlxsites/bamboohr-website/blob/main/404.html See in Actionhttps://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/404.html See in Actionhttps://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/404.html See in ActionDon’t Serve: .hlxignoreThere are some files in your repo that should not be served from your website, either because you would like to keep them private or they are not relevant to the delivery of the website (e.g. tests, build tools, build artifacts, etc.) and don’t need to be observed by the AEM bot. You can add those to a .hlxignore file in the same format as the well-known .gitignore file.Please see the following example.https://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/.hlxignoreTame the Bots: robots.txtA robots.txt file is generally a regular file that is served as you would expect on your production website on your own domain. To protect your preview and origin site from being indexed, your .page and .live sites will serve a robots.txt file that disallows all robots instead of the robots.txt file from your repo.https://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/robots.txthttps://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/robots.txthttps://github.com/adobe/helix-website/blob/main/robots.txtQuery and Indexing: helix-query.yamlThere is a flexible indexing facility that lets you keep track of all of your content pages conveniently as a spreadsheet. This facility is often used to show lists or feeds of pages as well as to filter and sort content on a website. Please see the document Indexing for more information.https://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-query.yamlhttps://github.com/adobe/design-website/blob/main/helix-query.yamlhttps://github.com/adobe/blog/blob/main/helix-query.yamlAutomate Your Sitemap: helix-sitemap.yamlComplex sitemaps can automatically be created for you whenever authors publish new content, including flexible hreflang mappings where needed. This functionality is usually based on the indexing facility.See this GitHub issue for sitemap configuration options.https://github.com/adobe/pages/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yamlhttps://github.com/adobe/fedpub/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yamlhttps://github.com/adobe/express-website/blob/main/helix-sitemap.yamlCommonly Used File and Folder StructureBeyond the files treats as special or configuration files, there is a commonly-used structure that is expressed in the Boilerplate repo.The common folders below are usually in the root directory of a project repo, but in cases where only a portion of a website is handled by AEM, they are often moved to a subfolder to reflect the mapping of the route of the origin in a CDN.This means that in a case where for example only /en/blog/ is initially mapped to AEM from the CDN, all the folder structures below (eg. /scripts, /styles, /blocks etc.) are moved into a the /en/blog/ folder in GitHub to keep the CDN mapping as simple as possible.With a simple adjustment of the reference to scripts.js and styles.css in head.html (see above) it is possible to indicate that all the necessary files are loaded from the respective code base directory. To avoid url rewriting the folder structure is also created the content source (eg. sharepoint or google drive) by having a directory structure of /en/blog/.In many cases as the AEM footprint grows on a site there is a point in time when the code gets moved back to the root folder and the head.html references are adjusted accordingly.Scripts and StylesBy convention in a AEM project, the head.html references styles.css, scripts.js, and lib-aem.js located in /scripts and /styles, as the entry points for the project code.scripts.js is where your global custom javascript code lives and is where the block loading code is triggered. styles.css hosts the global styling information for your site, and minimally contains the global layout information that is needed to display the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).As all three files are loaded before the page can be displayed, it is important that they are kept relatively small and executed efficiently.Beyond styles.css, a lazy-styles.css file is commonly used, which is loaded after the LCP event, and therefore can contain slower/more CSS information. This could be a good place for fonts or global CSS that is below the fold.In addition to scripts.js, there is the commonly-used delayed.js. This is a catch-all for libraries that need to be loaded on a page but should be kept from interfering with the delivery of the page. This is a good place for code that is outside of the control of your project and usually includes the martech stack and other libraries.Please see the document Keeping it 100, Web Performance for more information about optimizing your site performance.BlocksMost of the project-specific CSS and JavaScript code lives in blocks. Authors create blocks in their documents. Developers then write the corresponding code that styles the blocks with CSS and/or decorates the DOM to take the markup of a block and transform it to the structure that’s needed or convenient for desired styling and functionality.The block name is used as both the folder name of a block as well as the filename for the .css and .js files that are loaded by the block loader when a block is used on a page.The block name is also used as the CSS class name on the block to allow for intuitive styling. The javascript is loaded as a module (ESM) and exports a default function that is executed as part of the block loading.A simple example is the Columns Block. It adds additional classes in JavaScript based on how many columns are in the respective instance created by the author. This allows it to be able to use flexible styling of content that is in two columns vs. three columns.IconsMost projects have SVG files that are usually added to the /icons folder, and can be referenced with a :<iconname>: notation by authors. By default, icons are inlined into the DOM so they can be styled with CSS, without having to create SVG symbols.

Block CollectionThis is a collection of blocks considered a part of the AEM product and are recommended as blueprints for blocks in your project.These blocks come from real production AEM projects. To be a part of this collection, a block needs to have a high use across a number of projects and provide enough abstract functionality and be general enough so it can be reused without having to change the underlying content model.As the needs and designs of websites change, the block collection will change as well. Additions will be made to reflect emerging needs of projects, but blocks that are not used frequently enough will also be removed (deprecated).There are few technical principles for the blocks in the collection:Intuitive: Content structure that’s intuitive and easy to authorUseable: No dependencies, compatible with boilerplateResponsive: Works across all breakpointsContext Aware: Inherits CSS context such text and background colorsLocalizable: No hard-coded contentFast: No negative performance impactSEO and A11y: SEO friendly and accessibleAll of the blocks can be considered as a basis for your own block development. It is very likely that you will change all the .css and .js code to meet your own project needs. The primary value of these blocks is the content structure they provide.Considering that the code of your block will be fully adapted to your project, there is no intent for the blocks in the collection to be backwards compatible to their respective older versions or to make them upgradable.BoilerplateThe most commonly used blocks (as well as default content types) are curated in the AEM Boilerplate and are a part of every AEM project. For a block to become a part of boilerplate it has to be used by the vast majority of all AEM projects.The code base for all the blocks in AEM Boilerplate is open-source and can be found on GitHub adobe/aem-boilerplateBlocks in AEM Boilerplate can be discovered using the sidekick library below, use the copy button to copy the corresponding content structure into your clipboard and paste into a document to see the content structure.HeadingsDefault ContentDifferent levels of headings provide the semantic backbone of your documentTextBody text or copy with rich semantic formatting optionsImagesPictures bring your content aliveListsOrdered and unordered lists wherever they are neededLinksReference other websites or your own contentButtonsCall-to-action buttons and moreCodeHighlight preformatted code snippets in your contentSectionsGroup content on your page into sectionsMake your content more interesting with iconsHeroBlockHero treatment at the top of a pageColumnsFlexible way to handle multi-column layouts in a responsive wayCardsList of cards with or without images and linksHeaderFlexible header and navigation exampleFooterSimple extensible footer blockMetadataAdd metadata to your page where neededSection MetadataHighlight or structure all the content in a sectionThe block collection contains blocks that are commonly-used, but are not so common to be considered boilerplate. As a rule-of-thumb, to be included in the block collection a block must be used on more than half of all AEM projects.The block collection can be the entry path into boilerplate code. Likewise if a block in the boilerplate is no longer used as much, it can be moved to this collection.The code base for all the blocks in AEM Block Collection is open-source and can be found on GitHub adobe/aem-block-collectionBlocks in AEM Block Collection can be discovered using the sidekick library below, use the copy button to copy the corresponding content structure into your clipboard and paste into a document to see the content structure.EmbedA simple way to embed social media content into AEM pagesFragmentShare pieces of content across multiple pagesTableA way to organize tabular data into rows and columnsVideoDisplay and playback videos directly from AEMAccordionA stack of descriptive labels that can be toggled to display related full contentBreadcrumbsBlock Add-onA list of page titles and relevant links showing the location of the current page in the navigational hierarchyCarouselA dynamic display tool that smoothly transitions through a series of images with optional text contentModalAutoblockA popup that appears over other site contentQuoteA display of a quotation or a highlight of specific passage (or “pull quotes”) within a documentSearchAllows users to find site content by entering a search termTabsSegment information into multiple labeled (or “tabbed”) panelsFormBlock (Deprecated)A set of input controls grouped together that enables users to submit informationThe block collection is continually evolving based on the feedback from the AEM community. If you think that there is a block that should be included in the block collection please speak to your AEM contact. Current candidates for inclusion in the block collection include:Consent BannerIf you have immediate need of a block that is not yet part of the collection, it is relatively easy to find AEM projects on GitHub that have example implementations for all of the above candidates.Block PartyThe Block Party is a place for the AEM developer community to showcase what they have built on AEM sites. It also allows others to avoid reinventing the wheel and reuse these blocks / code snippets / integrations built by the community and tweak the code as necessary to fit their own projects. See Block Party for everything it has to offer.Note: While we love and support our AEM developer community, Adobe is not responsible for maintaining or updating the code that is showcased in Block Party.

Spreadsheets and JSONIn addition to translating Google Docs and Word documents into markdown and HTML markup, AEM also translates spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel workbooks and Google Sheets) into JSON files that can easily be consumed by your website or web application.This enables many uses for content that is table-oriented or structured.Sheets and Sheet structureThe simplest example of a sheet consists of a table that uses the first row as column names and the subsequent rows as data. An example might look something like this.After a preview and publish via the sidekick, AEM translates this table to a JSON representation which is served to requests to the corresponding .json resource. The above example gets translated to:AEM allows you to manage workbooks with multiple sheets.If there is only one sheet, AEM will by default use that sheet as the source of the information.If there are multiple sheets, AEM will only deliver sheets that are prefixed with helix- which lets you keep additional information and possibly formulas in the same spreadsheet that are not delivered to the web.If there is a sheet named helix-default, it is delivered if there are no additional query parameters supplied.See the following section for details on how to query a specific sheet.Query ParametersOffset and LimitSpreadsheets and JSON files can get very large. In such cases, AEM supports the use of limit and offset query parameters to indicate which rows of the spreadsheet are delivered.As AEM always compresses the JSON, payloads are generally relatively small. Therefore by default AEM limits the number of rows it returns to 1000 if the limit query parameter is not specified. This is sufficient for many simple cases.SheetThe sheet query parameter allows an application to specify one or multiple specific sheets in the spreadsheet or workbook. As an example ?sheet=jobs will return the sheet named helix-jobs and ?sheet=jobs&sheet=articles will return the data for the sheets named helix-jobs and helix-articles.Special Sheet NamesIn certain use cases, AEM also writes to spreadsheets, where it expects specific sheet names.The forms service only writes to a sheet named incoming, which is never delivered as a JSON.The index service only writes to a sheet named raw_index, which may be delivered to JSON in a simple single sheet setup.See the links above for more information on those services.ArraysNative arrays are not supported as cell values, so they are delivered as strings."tags": "[\"Adobe Life\",\"Responsibility\",\"Diversity & Inclusion\"]"You can turn them back into arrays in JavaScript using JSON.parse().

IndexingAdobe Experience Manager offers a way to keep an index of all the published pages in a particular section of your website. This is commonly used to build lists, feeds, and enable search and filtering use cases for your pages or content fragments.AEM keeps this index in a spreadsheet and offers access to it using JSON. Please see the document Spreadsheets and JSON for more information.We will introduce the concept of creating a query index by previewing an Excel workbook or Google spreadsheet first. Note, that if you already have a custom query definition in a file called helix-query.yaml in your GitHub repository, it is no longer possible to create indexes that way. Every new index will have to be manually added to that helix-query.yaml.Setting Up an Initial Query IndexIn this section we’ll create a query index in the root folder that will index all documents in your backend.After setting up your fstab.yaml with a mountpoint that points into your SharePoint site or Google Drive, go to the root folder.Depending on your backend, create either a workbook named query-index.xlsx for SharePoint or a spreadsheet named query-index for Google Drive.In that spreadsheet or workbook, create a sheet named raw_index.Setting Up Properties to be Added to the IndexIn your query-index document, add a header line and in the first column add path as the header name.In the following columns of the header line, add all other properties you need extracted from the rendered HTML page.In the following example in Google Drive, the extracted fields are title, image, description, and lastModified.Pages are indexed when they are published. To remove pages from index, they have to be unpublished.For simple scenarios without custom index definition, pages that have robots metadata property set to noindex will automatically be omitted from indexing by AEM. (There are a few special scenarios here, for more details see the section Special Scenarios for Robots).The following table summarizes the properties that are available and from where in the HTML page they’re extracted.Returns the content of the meta tag named article:tag in the head element as an array.See the document Spreadsheets and JSON for more information on array-handling.For every other header added, the indexer will try to find a meta tag with a corresponding name.Activate Your IndexTo activate your index, preview the spreadsheet using the sidekick. This will create an index configuration.Checking Your IndexThe Admin Service has an API endpoint where you can check the index representation of your page. Given your GitHub owner, repository, branch and owner, and a resource path to a page, its endpoint is:https://admin.hlx.page/index/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/<path>You should get a JSON response where the data node contains the index representation of the page.Debugging Your Index ConfigurationThe AEM CLI has a feature where it will print the index record whenever you change your query configuration, which assists in finding the correct CSS selectors:$ aem up --print-indexPlease see the AEM CLI GitHub documentation for more information and watch this video to learn more about this feature.Setting Up More Index ConfigurationsYou can define your own custom index configurations by creating your own helix-query.yaml. This allows you to have more than one index configuration in the same helix-query.yaml, where parts of your sites are indexed into different Excel workbooks or Google spreadsheets. See the document Indexing reference for more information.Special Scenarios for RobotsThere are a few nuances on how pages get indexed by AEM in conjunction with indexing setup for your site. Let’s look at them:In the following 2 situations, setting robots to noindex on the page metadata would not prevent it from being indexed by AEM:You have added a robots column in query-index.xlsxYou have a helix-query.yaml in your Github repository i.e. you have defined a custom index definition.RecommendationsIf you do not have a custom index definition, it is recommended to not add a robots column to your index sheet unless you have a requirement for doing so.Adding robots column to your index sheet would cause a page to be indexed by AEM even though it may have robots metadata set to noindex.If you do have a custom index definition, pages would get indexed by AEM irrespective of setting robots to noindex on the page metadata. If you want to prevent this from happening, you can use spreadsheet filters to omit pages from index that have robots metadata set to noindex. For more details, see the section titled "Enforcing noindex configuration with custom index definitions" below.Enforcing “noindex” configuration with custom index definitionsIf you have defined your own custom index definitions in helix-query.yaml, setting the robots property to noindex is not effective in preventing the pages from getting indexed. In order to enforce noindex configuration is such situations, do the following:Create a sheet named “helix-default” in your query-index.xlsx . After this, your query-index.xlsx spreadsheet should have 2 sheets “raw_index” and “helix-default”. The “raw_index” sheet is there to have all the raw indexed data.Modify your custom helix-query.yaml (it must be in your project’s Github repository) and add the robots property so that it gets indexed.Now set up your “helix-default” sheet in the query-index.xlsx spreadsheet to get automatically filled up using Excel formula which ensures that all the rows in raw_index which have robots property set as noindex, do not get copied over to the helix-default sheet. This can be done by using an Excel formula like this =FILTER(Table1,NOT(Table1[robots]="noindex"))Now your helix-default sheet has only the rows from raw_index that do not have robots property set to noindex.Ensure that you publish the pages that you want to get indexed.Now if you fetch the index as usual like: https://<branch>--<repo>-<org>.hlx.page/query-index.json, you’d only get data from helix-default sheet i.e. entries that are not explicitly prevented from getting indexed through the robot property set as noindex.

Web Performance, Keeping your Lighthouse Score 100.The quality of the experience of websites is crucial to achieving the business goals of your website and the satisfaction of your visitors.Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is optimized to deliver excellent experiences and optimal web performance. With the Real Use Monitoring (RUM) operations data collection, information is continuously collected from field use and offers a way to iterate on real use performance measurements without having to wait for the CRuX data to show effects of code and deployment changes. It is common for field data collected in RUM to deviate from the lab results, as the network, geo-location and processing power for real devices are much more diverse than the simulated conditions in a lab.The Google PageSpeed Insight Service is proven to be a great lab measurement tool. It can be used to avoid the slow deterioration of the performance and experience score of your website.If you start your project with the Boilerplate as in the Developer Tutorial, you will get a very stable Lighthouse score on PageSpeed Insight for both Mobile and Desktop at 100. On every component of the lighthouse score there is some buffer for the project code to consume and still be within the boundaries of a perfect 100 lighthouse score.Testing Your Pull RequestsIt turns out that it is hard to improve your Lighthouse score once it is low, but it is not hard to keep it at 100 if you continuously test.When you open a pull request (PR) on a project, the test URLs in the description of your project are used to run the PageSpeed Insights Service against. The AEM GitHub bot will automatically fail your PR if the score is below 100 with a little bit of buffer to account for some volatility of the results.The results are for the mobile lighthouse score, as they tend to be harder to achieve than desktop.Why Google PageSpeed Insights?Many teams and individuals use their own configurations for measuring Lighthouse scores. Different teams have developed their own test harnesses and use their own test tools with configurations that have been set up as part of their continuous monitoring and performance reporting practices.The performance of a website impacts its rankings in search results, which is reflected by the Core Web Vitals in the crUX report. Google has a great handle on the relevant average combinations of device information (e.g. screen size) as well as network performance of those devices. But in the end, SEO is the ultimate arbiter of what good vs. bad web performance is. As the specific configuration is a moving target, performance practices should be aligned with the current average devices and network characteristics globally.So instead of using a project specific configuration for Lighthouse testing, we use the continuously-updated configurations seen as part of the mobile and desktop strategies referenced in the latest versions of the Google PageSpeed Insights API.While there may be additional insight that some developers feel they can collect from other ways of measuring Lighthouse scores, to be able to have a meaningful and comparable performance conversation across projects, there needs to be a way to measure performance universally. The default PageSpeed Insight Service is the most authoritative, most widely accepted lab test when it comes to measuring your performance.However it is important to remember that the recommendations that you get from PageSpeed Insights do not necessarily lead to better results, especially the closer you get to a lighthouse score of 100.Core Web Vitals (CWV) collected by the built-in RUM data collection play an important role in validating results. For minor changes, however, the variance of the results and the lack of sufficient data points (traffic) over a short period of time makes it impractical to get statistically relevant results in most cases.Three-Phase Loading (E-L-D)Dissecting the payload that's on a web page into three phases makes it relatively straight-forward to achieve a clean lighthouse score and therefore set a baseline for a great customer experience.The three phase loading approach divides the payload and execution of the page into three phasesPhase E (Eager): This contains everything that's needed to get to the largest contentful paint (LCP).Phase L (Lazy): This contains everything that is controlled by the project and largely served from the same origin.Phase D (Delayed): This contains everything else such as third-party tags or assets that are not material to experience.Phase E: EagerIn the eager phase, everything that's needed to be loaded for the true LCP to be displayed is loaded. In a project, this usually consists of the markup, the CSS styles and JavaScript files.In many cases the LCP element is contained in a block (often created by auto blocking), where the block .js and and .css also have to be loaded.The block loader unhides sections progressively, which means that all the blocks of the first section have to be loaded for the LCP to become visible. For this reason, it might make sense to have a smaller section containing as little as needed at the top of a page.It is a good rule of thumb to keep the aggregate payload before the LCP is displayed below 100kb, which usually results in an LCP event quicker than 1560ms (LCP scoring at 100 in PSI). Especially on mobile the network tends to be bandwidth constrained, so changing the loading sequence before LCP has minimal to no impact.Loading from or connecting to a second origin before the LCP occurred is strongly discouraged as establishing a second connection (TLS, DNS, etc.) adds a significant delay to the LCP.Phase L: LazyIn the lazy phase, the portion of the payload is loaded that doesn't affect total blocking time (TBT) and ultimately first input delay (FID).This includes things like loading blocks (JavaScript and CSS) as well as loading all the remaining images according to their loading="lazy" attribute and other JavaScript libraries that are not blocking. The lazy phase is generally everything that happens in the various blocks you are going to create to cover the project needs.In this phase it would still be advisable that the bulk of the payload come from the same origin and is controlled by the first party, so that changes can be made if needed to avoid negative impact on TBT, TTI and FID.Phase D: DelayedIn the delayed phase, the parts of the payload are loaded that don't have an immediate impact to the experience and/or are not controlled by the project and come from third parties. Think of marketing tooling, consent management, extended analytics, chat/interaction modules etc. which are often deployed through tag management solutions.It is important to understand that for the impact on the overall customer experience to be minimized, the start of this phase needs to be significantly delayed. The delayed phase should be at least three seconds after the LCP event to leave enough time for the rest of the experience to get settled.The delayed phase is usually handled in delayed.js which serves as an initial catch-all for scripts that cause TBT. Ideally, the TBT problems are removed from the scripts in question either by loading them outside of the main thread (in a web worker) or by just removing the actual blocking time from the code. Once the problems are fixed, those libraries can easily be added to the lazy phase and be loaded earlier.Ideally there is no blocking time in your scripts, which is sometimes hard to achieve as commonly used technology like tag managers or build tooling create large JavaScript files that are blocking as the browser is parsing them. From a performance perspective it is advisable to remove those techniques, make sure your individual scripts are not blocking and load them individually as separate smaller files.Header and FooterThe header and specifically the footer of the page are not in the critical path to the LCP, which is why they are loaded asynchronously in their respective blocks. Generally, resources that do not share the same life cycle (meaning that they are updated with authoring changes at different times) should be kept in separate documents to make the caching chain between the origins and the browser simpler and more effective. Keeping those resources separate increases cache hit ratios and reduces cache invalidation and cache management complexity.FontsSince web fonts are often a strain on bandwidth and loaded from a different origin via a font service like https://fonts.adobe.com or https://fonts.google.com, it is largely impossible to load fonts before the LCP, which is why they are usually added to the lazy-styles.css and are loaded after the LCP is displayed.LCP BlocksThere are situations where the actual LCP element is not included in the markup that is transmitted to the client. This happens when there is an indirection or lookup (for example a service that’s called, a fragment that’s loaded or a lookup that needs to happen in a .json) for the LCP element.In those situations, it is important that the page loading waits with guessing the LCP candidate (currently the first image on the page) until the first block has made the necessary changes to the DOM.To identify which blocks to wait for before blocking for the LCP load, you can add the blocks that contain the LCP element to the LCP_BLOCKS array in scripts.js.Bonus: Speed is GreenBuilding websites that are fast, small, and quick to render is not just a good idea to deliver exceptional experiences that convert better, it is also a good way to reduce carbon emissions.

Markup, Sections, Blocks, and Auto BlockingTo design websites and create functionality, developers use the markup and DOM that is rendered dynamically from the content. The markup and DOM are constructed in a way that allows flexible manipulation and styling. At the same time it provides out-of-the-box functionality so the developer does not have to worry about some of the aspects of modern websites.Structure of a DocumentThe single most important aspect when structuring a document is to make it simple and intuitive for authors who will contribute the content.This means that it is strongly recommended to involve authors very early in the process. In many cases it is good practice to just let authors put the content that needs to go on to a page into a Google Doc or Word document without having any notion of blocks and section, and then try to make small structural changes and introduce sections and blocks only where necessary.A document follows the following structure in the abstract.A page as authored in Word or a Google Doc document uses the well-understood semantic model like headings, body text, lists, images, links, etc. that is shared between HTML, markdown, and Google Doc / Word. We call this default content. In an ideal situation one would leave as much of the content authored as default content as possible, since this is the natural way for authors to treat documents.In addition to default content, we have a concept of page sections, separated by horizontal rules or --- to group certain elements of a page together. There may be both semantic and design reasons to group content together. A simple case could be that a section of a page has a different background color.In addition to that there is concept of blocks which are authored as a table with a heading as the first row that identifies the type of block. This concept is the easiest approach to componentize your code.Sections can contain multiple blocks. Blocks should never be nested as it makes things very hard to use for authors.DOM vs. MarkupAEM produces a clean and easily readable semantic markup from the content that’s provided to it. You can easily access it using the view source feature and have a look at the markup of the page you are currently reading.The JavaScript library used in scripts.js takes the markup and enhances it into a DOM that is then used for most development tasks, specifically to build blocks. To create a DOM that’s easy to work with for custom project code, it is best to view it as a two-step process.In the first step, we create the markup with sections, blocks, and default content that will look similar to this.In the second step, the above mark-up is augmented into the following example DOM, which then can be used for styling and adding functionality. The differences between the markup that’s delivered from the server and the augmented DOM that is used for most of the development tasks is highlighted below.It primarily consists of introducing a wrapper <div> for blocks and default content and dynamically adding additional helpful CSS classes and data attributes that are used by the AEM block loader.Sections are a way to group default content and blocks by the author. Most of the time section breaks are introduced based on visual differences between sections such as a different background color for a part of a page.From a development perspective, there is usually not much interaction with sections beyond CSS styling.Sections can contain a special block called Section Metadata, which results in data attributes to a section. The names of the data attributes can be chosen by the authors, and the only well-known section metadata property is Style which will be turned into additional CSS classes added to the containing section element.Blocks and default content are always wrapped in a section, even if the author doesn’t specifically introduce section breaks.There is a broad range of semantics that are shared between Word documents, Google Docs, markdown, and HTML. For example there are headings of different levels (eg. <h1> - <h6>), images, links, lists (<ul>, <ol>), emphasis (<em>, <strong>) etc.We take advantage of the intuitive understanding that authors have of how to use these semantics in the tools that they are familiar with (eg. Word/Google docs) and maps those to markdown and then renders them in the HTML markup.All mappings should be relatively straightforward and intuitive for the developer. One area where we go a little bit further than the simplest possible translation is in handling images. Instead of a simple <img> tag, a full <picture> tag is rendered with a number of different resolutions needed for display on desktop and mobile devices as well as different formats for modern browsers that support webp and older browsers which do not.Most of the project-specific CSS and JavaScript lives in blocks. Authors create blocks in their documents and developers write the corresponding code that styles the blocks with CSS and/or decorates the DOM to take the markup of a block and transform it to the structure that’s needed or convenient for desired styling and functionality.The block name is used as both the folder name of a block as well as the filename for the CSS and JavaScript files that are loaded by the block loader when a block is used on a page. The block name is also used as the CSS class name on the block to allow for intuitive styling.The JavaScript is loaded as a Module (ESM) and exports a default function that is executed as part of the block loading.All block level CSS should be scoped to the block to make sure that there are no side-effects for other parts of your project, which means that all selectors in a block should be prefixed with the corresponding block class. In certain cases it makes sense to use the block’s wrapper or containing section for the selector as well.There is a balance of DOM manipulation in JavaScript and complexity of the CSS selectors. Complex brittle CSS selectors are not recommended and at the same time adding classes to every element makes your code more complex and disregards the semantics of elements.One of the most important tenets of a project is to keep things simple and intuitive for authors. Complicated blocks make it hard to author content, so it is important that developers absorb the complexity of translating an intuitive authoring experience into the DOM that is needed for layout or application logic. It is often tempting to delegate complexity to the author. Instead, developers should make sure that blocks do not become unwieldy to create for authors. An author should always be able to simply copy/paste a block and intuitively understand what it is about.Blocks can be very simple or contain full application components or widgets and provide a way for the developer to componentize their codebase into small chunks of code that can be managed easily and can be loaded on to the web pages as needed.A block’s content is rendered into the markup as nested <div> tags for the rows and columns that the author entered. In the simplest case, a block has only a single cell.Authors can add blocks to their pages in an ad-hoc manner by simply adding a table with the block name in the first row or table heading. Some blocks are also loaded automatically. header and footer blocks that need to be present on every page of a site are a good example of that.Block OptionsIf you need a block to look or behave slightly differently based on certain circumstances, but not different enough to become a new block in itself, you can let authors add block options to blocks in parentheses. These options add modified classes to the block. For example Columns (wide) in a table header will generate the following markup.<div class=”columns wide”>Block options can also contain multiple words. For example Columns (super wide) will be concatenated using hyphens.<div class=”columns super-wide”>If block options are comma-separated, such as Columns (dark, wide), they will be added as separate classes.<div class=”columns dark wide”>Auto BlockingIn an ideal scenario the majority of content is authored outside of blocks, as introducing tables into a document makes it harder to read and edit. Conversely blocks provide a great mechanism for developers to keep their code organized.A frequently-used mechanism to get the best of both worlds is called auto blocking. Auto blocking turns default content and metadata into blocks without the author having to physically create them. Auto blocking happens very early in the page decoration process before blocks are loaded and is a practice that programmatically creates the DOM structure of a block as it would come as markup from the server.Auto blocking is often used in combination with metadata, particularly the template property. If pages have a common template, meaning that they share a certain page design or functionality, that’s usually a good opportunity for auto blocking.A good example is an article header of a blog post. It might contain information about the author, the title of the blog post, a hero image, as well as the publication date. Instead of having the author put together a block that contains all that information, an auto block (e.g. article-header block) would be programmatically added to the page based on the <h1>, the first image, the blog author, and publication date metadata.This allows the content author to keep the information in its natural place, the document structure outside of a block. At the same time, the developer can keep all the layout and styling information in a block.Another very common use case is to wrap blocks around links in a document. A good example is an author linking to a YouTube video by simply including a link, while the developer would like to keep all the code for the video inline embed in an embed block.This mechanism can also be used as a flexible way to include both external applications and internal references to video, content fragments, modals, forms, and other application elements.The code for your projects auto blocking lives in buildAutoBlocks() in your scripts.js.Please see the following examples of auto blocking.Adobe BlogAEM Boilerplate

SitemapsCreate automatically generated sitemap files to be referenced from your robots.txt. This helps with SEO and the discovery of new content. AEM can generate three types of sitemaps: without any configuration, based solely on a query index or based on a manual sitemap configuration.Creating a Sitemap without any configurationIf you don’t do anything you will see your sitemap in sitemap.xml and have a sitemap index in sitemap.json. It will contain a list of all your published documents.If you started with another type of sitemap and would like to switch to this type, you’ll have to delete the helix-sitemap.yaml configuration file - either manually defined in GitHub or automatically generated - and reindex your site.Domain name used in external URLsTo customize the domain used in creating external URLs, add a property named host or cdn.prod.host in your project configuration (named .helix/config when using Google Drive as backend or .helix/config.xlsx on Sharepoint) and preview that file to activate it.Generating a Sitemap configuration based on an indexPlease see the document Indexing to learn more about indexing. In order to generate a sitemap configuration based on an index, please ensure that you have already set up an initial query index as explained there. This will generate a sitemap at the location:https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/sitemap.xmlAnd a sitemap configuration at the following location:https://<branch>--<repo>--<owner>.hlx.page/helix-sitemap.yamlIt is recommended that you create a sitemap-index.xml file that references all your sitemaps and keep that as part of your project code in your github repo. This way it is easy to add new sitemaps as the project expands.Manual setup of your Sitemap configurationIf you need more customization than your generated sitemap configuration file provides, you can copy its contents and paste it into a file named helix-sitemap.yaml in the root folder of your project.Note: When using a manually configured index and sitemap (e.g. your code repo includes a helix-query.yaml and helix-sitemap.yaml file) your index definition must include the robots property to ensure the sitemap excludes pages with robots: noindex metadata. When using auto-generated index definitions, simply follow the recommendations in the indexing documentation so those pages are excluded from the index.The following sections contain the supported types of sitemaps.Simple SitemapThe following is a simple helix-sitemap.yaml. It assumes a single index containing all the pages that need to appear in the sitemap.If you want last modification dates to be included in the URLs of your sitemap, add a lastmod property including a format to your configuration.Multiple SitemapsIt is common to have sitemaps per section of the sites and/or per country or language. AEM supports sitemaps including the corresponding hreflang references. In the following example we assume that there is a one to one mapping between the indexes and the sitemaps XML files.If there are two pages in the english and french section that share a common suffix, they will be related, so e.g. if you have a page /welcome in the english section and a page /fr/welcome in the french section, the resulting entry in the /sitemap-en.xml will look like this:A similar entry will be available in /sitemap-fr.xml.Specifying the primary language manuallyThere might be situations where you have alternate versions of a page, but you’re unable to use a common suffix to identify them, possibly because you’re porting a legacy website that should not have its paths changed. In that situation, you can specify a primary-language-url for the alternate location, in the metadata of the document.Let’s assume our primary language is english, we have a page /welcome in the english section and /fr/bienvenu in the french section, and the latter is an alternate version of the former.First, we add that information to the document at /fr/bienvenu in its metadata:This can also be added to a global metadata sheet, as shown in Bulk Metadata.Then, we add an indexed property primary-language-url to the french index:Finally, we re-publish the french page, and rebuild the sitemap.Specifying the default languageAnother common requirement is to specify the default language for a sitemap with multiple languages. This can be achieved by adding a property default in the sitemap:In the resulting sitemap, all entries from the english subtree will have an extra alternate entry with hreflang x-default.Specifying multiple hreflangs for one subtreeSometimes, it is required to map multiple hreflangs to only one language subtree, e.g. consider we want the following to appear in the resulting sitemap:Every page in our sitemap source should appear exactly once, but have multiple alternate hreflangs associated with it. In order to achieve this, you should specify an array of languages in the hreflang property:Multiple Indexes Aggregated Into One SitemapThere are cases where it is easier to have a single larger sitemap than fragmented small sitemaps, especially as there is a limit of sitemaps that can be submitted to search engines per site.The following example shows how to aggregate a number of separate indexes into a single sitemap.Using the same destination it is possible to combine multiple small sitemaps into one larger sitemap.Including other sitemaps as inputIn a mixed scenario, where not all languages in a sitemap are managed in AEM, you can include sitemaps from other language trees by specifying an XML path as source, as in:In this example, we use an external french sitemap to calculate all sitemap locations. AEM will determine alternates for english sitemap URLs by deconstructing the french counterparts in external sitemap using the alternate definition.Adding an extension to all locations in the sitemapIn a scenario, where you want all your locations to have an extension, e.g. .html, and you’re unable to generate a helix-sitemap sheet in your query index to derive a formula, you can add an extension to all languages or an individual language using an extension property:

An example of a basic form block can be found here.(Deprecated) Preparing a Sheet for Data IngestionAEM offers a forms service that ingests submitted data into a Microsoft Excel or Google Sheet document.Having data submitted through forms on your website flow directly into spreadsheets makes it easily accessible to business users. Such data can also interact with more complex automated workflows as both Google Sheets as well as Microsoft Excel and Sharepoint offer access to a vibrant ecosystem and robust APIs.Create an Excel workbook or Google sheet anywhere under your project directory. This document uses a sheet in OneDrive called email-form.xlsx in the root of an AEM project.Make sure the AEM user (for example helix@adobe.com) that is configured for your project has edit permission on the sheet.Open the workbook created and rename the default sheet to incoming.Note: AEM will not send any data to this workbook if the incoming sheet does not exist.Preview the sheet in the sidekick.Note: Even if a sheet has been previewed previously it must be previewed again after creating the incoming sheet for the first time.Set up the sheet with the headers that match the data being ingested. You can either do this manually or by sending a POST request to the form route in the AEM Admin service. The admin service will look at the data in the POST body and create the necessary headers/tables and sheets required to ingest data and get the most from the forms service.For details on the format of the POST request to set up your sheet, see the Admin API documentation as well as the following examplePOST /form/{owner}/{repo}/{ref}/en/email-form.json HTTP/1.1{"data":{"firstName":"test"}}Response:HTTP/1.1 200 OK{"rowCount":2,"columns":["firstName"]}You can use a tool like curl or Postman to make this POST request. For example:curl -s -i -X POST 'https://admin.hlx.page/form/{owner}/{repo}/{ref}/en/email-form.json' \--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \--data '{"data":{"firstName":"test"}}'Through the above POST request, we are providing sample data i.e. the form fields and sample values which will be used by the Admin service for setting up the form.The Admin service is recommended to set up your sheet, but if you would like to create the headers manually, please see the document Manual Forms Sheet Setup.After sending the POST request to the admin service you will see the following changes to your workbook.A sheet named helix-default is created. The data in this sheet is what will be returned when a GET request is made to the sheet. This is a great place to use spreadsheet formulas to summarize the data from the incoming sheet for consumption elsewhere.Note: The helix-default sheet should never contain any personally identifiable information or other data you are not ok with being publicly accessible.A sheet named slack was created. Here you can set up automatic notifications to a Slack channel anytime data is ingested to your spreadsheet. Currently AEM only supports notifications to the AEM Engineering slack org as well as the Adobe Enterprise Support org.To setup Slack notifications enter the teamId of the Slack workspace and the channel name or ID. You can also ask the slack-bot (with the debug command) for the teamId and the channel ID. Using the channel ID instead of the name is preferable, as it survives channel renames.Note: Older forms didn’t have the teamId column. The teamId was included in the channel column, separated by a # or /.Enter any title you want and under fields enter the names of the fields you want to see in the Slack notification. Each heading should be separated by a comma (eg. name, email).(Deprecated) Sending Data to Your SheetThe sheet is now ready for data ingestion and you can send POST requests directly to the sheet on hlx.page, hlx.live or your production domain.Note: The URL should not include the .json extension. The sheet must be published for POST operations to work on .live or on the production domain.There are a few different ways you can format the form data in the POST body.As an array of name/value pairshttps://gist.github.com/dylandepass/9ba6b83700dfce1fa90a47bde62c2e9As an object with key/value pairshttps://gist.github.com/dylandepass/2b5f694723dfdb3d304fcafc613d6595As x-www-form-urlencoded body (content-type header must be set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded)https://gist.github.com/dylandepass/b72b2e30313bc80beb02e12b1d7201ffThat’s it! The forms service runs every minute so you will quickly see your data ingested into the sheet.Author-Created FormsIn many cases it is desirable to have authors create forms and decide what form fields should be presented to the visitor of your website. It is common to use the helix-default sheet of the same spreadsheet that is used for the submission of the form as the place to let the author define their forms.Usually, there is a forms block that takes a reference to the spreadsheet and renders the form and handles the user flow through submission.A simple example of such a basic form block can be found here. You can also use the Adaptive Forms Block to develop forms.See the following example of what the spreadsheet for the form definition could look like.The supported form fields are extensible and the form should be viewed as an example that gives you a starting point.As an example a fully-functional form was added to this page, using the previously-listed code base by simply adding the following block in the Google Doc:Feel free to try it out and see the form data flow into the incoming sheet. It may take a minute to get from the form service to the spreadsheet.

Notes:Semantic headings are the backbone of any document structure. In documents you should always follow the semantic hierarchy of your document, meaning that a Heading 1 should contain a Heading 2 which in turn should contain a Heading 3 and so forth.In cases where you find yourself using the headings out of sequence or leaving gaps in the heading hierarchy, that’s usually an indication that you are either trying to use headings to adjust to visual or design constraints or you are using headings for something that is semantically not a heading. Either of those can lead to bad results.According to Web best practices there should only be a single Heading 1 per page, which will also be used as the default title for the document.Example:See Live outputContent Structure:The Content Structure leverages the built-in Heading 1 - Heading 6 mapped to h1 through h6.See Content in DocumentCode:As headings are default content they are styled in project or block CSS code. There is usually no JavaScript code used.There is no code related to list generic styling in Boilerplate.

A Text Paragraph (or Copy) is the most common element on websites. AEM understands and translates a number of semantic formatting like bold, italic, underline, strike-through as well as subscript and superscript, which are translated to their respective semantic HTML tags of <strong>, <em>, <u>, <s>, <sup> and <sub>.CSS styling may take hints from these formatting options and use them to express visually very different styling. Both a paragraph and line-feed are supported.The first portion of the first text paragraph serves as the default description for the a page if nothing else is specified in metadata.The content structure is based on the simple Normal Text paragraphs in word or google doc.As text is Default Content it is styled in project or block CSS code. There is usually no JavaScript code used.This code is included in boilerplate, there is no need to copy it.https://github.com/adobe/helix-project-boilerplate/blob/27e8571592220da8ded7c8a7e5064d982f7cfe76/styles/styles.css#L45-L51

Pictures, Illustrations and Images are an integral part of making a web experience both more informative and also more engaging. Simply add images to your documents either by inserting them or just copy/paste images from your source.Add Alt-texts to your images to make your content more accessible. Both Word and Google Docs have great support for that.AEM automatically takes care of resizing the images to the appropriate size for the website and converting them into the formats that make sense for the consuming browser.We recommend inserting your images with at least a width of 2000 pixels if available, so even at a large display resolution the images will still be crisp.The first image on a page will automatically become the image that is used in metadata (for social media and messaging applications) unless defined otherwise in metadata.Special Mention for GDocs: Google downsizes the images to a maximum of 1600 pixels width or 1600 height. This is still sufficient for most use cases of photography images, but for some illustrations it can lead to visible artifacts.As images are considered Default Content they are styled in project or block CSS code.

Lists serve many purposes in the Web in general, some uses or obvious lists inside default content, while others are used in navigations or other hierarchical constructs.Extraction of nested numbered lists and bullet lists is supported. Lists are converted to the <ol> and <ul> HTML tags respectively.Complex list items seem to be hard to manage in word processing without accidentally being broken up so it is generally recommended to keep lists relatively simple when it comes to the complexity of the items in the list.As lists are considered Default Content they are styled in project or block CSS code.

Hyperlinks are essential to connect websites and your content. To create a link, just use the insert link option in word or google doc.Links can be added across all the default content and the different formatting options.In Word and Google Docs only absolute links are accepted, which is usually easier to copy paste from your browser. Links are automatically converted to be relative to your site, while external links are kept absolute.Links are often used beyond text links and reference for example embedded media or referenced fragments that are inlined in the page.As links are considered Default Content they are styled in project or block CSS code. There is usually no JavaScript code used.There is no link related styling code in the boilerplate project.Special Mention: Microsoft Word Online does not allow links on images, so a workaround would be to let authors put a link directly below the image and then wrap it on the client side, e.g.Special Mention: It is recommended to handle certain links that need to be opened in a new window based on whether they are external links or PDFs (for example) on the client side, e.g.

Websites very often contain buttons, as call to actions or more generically. By default in the Boilerplate project buttons are created as a link in a paragraph by itself.Bold and Italic (<strong> and <em>) and possibly combinations thereof are used to specify certain types of buttons. There are often primary and secondary buttons and the default styling is usually defined for default content and/or specified by a containing block, and Bold and Italic can be used to specify alternative variations of buttons.As Buttons are considered Default Content they are styled in project or block CSS code.There is Javascript code for decoration purposes that is included in the default boilerplate behavior and it usually remains unchanged.Decoration CodeThe CSS Styling is very project specific and gets adjusted as needed for a project or block by block.Styling CodeAll the code above is part of the Boilerplate project and does not need to be copied.

Most technical documentation websites (including this one) have the need to display code. Most marketing websites don’t have that requirement, but since there is an intuitive and simple styling and markup the notion of code elements both inline and preformatted multiline is supported out of the box.Formatting something in word or gdoc as a fixed font (eg. Courier New) will automatically output a <code> element or a <code> and <pre> block for multiline.As the code functionality is part of Default Content it is usually really just a matter of styling things according to the project specific CSS rules.This code is part of boilerplate so there is no need to copy it.See Boilerplate Styling

Sections are the top level grouping mechanism in documents, think of them as containers for a set of default content and blocks. Learn more about the Document Structure here.Sections are separated by “Horizontal Rules” or --- to group certain elements of a page together. There may be both semantic and design reasons to group content together, a simple case could be that a section of a page has a different background color.Technically a section just introduces a <div> wrapper in the markup delivered around all the blocks and default content contained in the section.In most cases generic sections don’t have much styling code beyond project specific box layout (eg. margins, padding, max-width) and are sometimes augmented with section metadata to control styling (often background colors or images).See Section Styling Code

*** New Page ***https://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection/icons
Most if not all websites have icons, therefore there is a simple way to reference icons for authors.Icons are referenced as :<iconname>: notation. As there are different ways to implement icons in the browser either as plain css classes, icon fonts or SVG, we offer a non-intrusive way to support all of those.The boilerplate project includes an automatic mechanism to insert SVGs into the icon `<span>`s as that’s the most common way to deal with icons.While some icons need to be in the code (icons referenced in blocks for example), there are times when authors need to add and reference new icons and update them on an ongoing basis. These icons can and should live with the content under an /icons/ folder in the content source (eg. Sharepoint or Google Drive). These icons can also be referenced the exact same way using the :<iconname>: notation. This will allow marketers to add and update icons they need for content without any dependency on a code change.The :<iconname>: can be inserted as a part of all Default Content constructs.Icons are Default Content and are styled in project specific CSS code. If there is any JavaScript that is required to load the SVGs it can be adapted as needed.This code is included in Boilerplate, there is no need to copy it.See SVG loading Code

Header (Block)The header block is loaded by default in the boilerplate project into the <header> element.Out-of-the-box it provides code for a responsive navigation but it is like most blocks very likely to be extended or adjusted on the per project basis.The header block is usually not referenced by authors but is loaded automatically on every page.The content for the navigation is loaded as a fragment and is by default authored in a nav (or nav.docx) document, and structured primarily into three sections for branding, navigation sections (nested <ul>) and tools.The nav document has its own lifecycle and when previewed or published applies to all pages that use a given navigation.It is not uncommon to have multiple nav documents for a site eg. one per locale / language or section of a site.This code is included in Boilerplate, there is no need to copy it.Boilerplate Block Code

The Metadata table is handled by HTML rendering service internally to add <meta> tags in the <head> of the HTML markup delivered from the service. There should only be one Metadata table per page and while its placement doesn’t matter, by convention it is placed at the bottom of the document.The metadata table is essentially following an intuitive name/value pair structure where the name is in the first column of the table and the value is in the second column.There are a few well-known properties that behave according to the HTML specification and popular additional metadata schemes like og: and twitter: the well known metadata properties include Title, Description, Image, Tags and Feed.Beyond the well-known properties there are some special semantics for Theme and Template that are added as classes to the <body> tag by the boilerplate code and are often used for styling and autoblocking.Beyond that a project can add an arbitrary number of name value pairs that get added as <meta> tags to the markup, and can be used with project specific semantics.The metadata table is processed as part of the HTML rendering service. There is no project code related to the processing.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 0Introduction to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery ServicesI discuss how Edge Delivery Services works with providers, focusing on Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.I create a Hello World block.Back to TopIntroductionI am a developer; arrays start at element 0, or I began writing with part 1 and now need an introduction. You choose.This series of articles discusses developing with Adobe’s Edge Delivery Services in the Context of Document Authoring.What is Document Authoring?Creating and publishing content in the digital landscape involves multiple steps and stakeholders. Subject Matter Experts generate original content, which goes through an approval process. The approved content is then passed to Content Authors, who copy and paste sub-edited content into the Content Management System (CMS) for publishing. This process can be time-consuming, especially in regulated industries, where the approval process can take a long time.Content Authors dislike CMS systems. They are forced to use “components” and “templates” created by technicians, using “page properties” and “dialog boxes” to pull the whole piece together; they have to sub-edit the copy because it often won’t fit in the constraints of the CMS. They usually have to backport the content to the original document format as a system of record. Returning the document to the SME with a link to the final web-page page.Product Owners dislike CMS systems, especially in regulated industries. They must get approval for every line of text they place on the web. Regulated industries, like pharmaceuticals, automobile makers, insurers, etc., are legally bound by the content they publish and the corporation's stringent requirements. One product owner I know of asked that pre-approved Excel spreadsheets drive the entire CMS; however, the technicians have built the components and templates around dialogue boxes. He, too, had to use the copy-paste methodology.Enter Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services from Adobe, sometimes called EDS. This system stands out for its innovative approach to web publishing and promises to redefine efficiency and simplicity in the industry.It is a cutting-edge document-based CMS, named in tribute to Rosalind Franklin, whose work was crucial in deciphering DNA's structure. It has transformed from the "Helix" concept to the current "Edge Delivery Services," signifying its growth from a rudimentary tool to a comprehensive digital content management solution. It has shared all three names in its lifetime: Franklin, Helix and now Edge Delivery Services.Why Document Authoring with Adobe Edge Delivery Services MattersEdge Delivery Services' significance lies in its speed and serverless architecture, which eliminates the complexities of server management and offers a seamless experience for content creators. It integrates effortlessly with tools that users are already familiar with, making content editing and management as intuitive as using everyday office applications. It offers a rapid development and release environment for document-based content creation, keeping the Content Authors and Product Managers happy and using tools they know well.Key features:Improved speed, scalability and authoring experienceReduced coding requirementsStreamlined content creation and deliveryQuicker website updatesBenefits:Enhanced user experienceIncreased efficiencyReduced costsUse cases:Building high-performance websitesLanding page creationDelivering rich media contentCreating personalized digital experiencesConclusion:Edge Delivery Services is a powerful tool for businesses looking to enhance their online presence. Its focus on speed, scalability and ease of use can help companies to create engaging and compelling digital experiences.Weighing the Benefits and LimitationsEdge Delivery Services is designed to deliver content with unparalleled efficiency, addressing the challenges of handling extensive information without compromising performance. It opens the content management field to a broader audience, enabling more professionals to contribute effectively. However, it's essential to acknowledge that Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services may not be the one-size-fits-all solution for every scenario, mainly where intricate customization and deep content modelling and structuring are paramount. Edge Delivery Services offers deeper integration with traditional AEM for requests that require content modelling and deeper integration with the back-end. Adobe has you covered. Think of Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services as the rapid delivery of traditional documents - ‘a Content Marketing System’. When customers require more sophisticated back-ends, AEM Authoring with Edge Delivery Services is ready to take up the workload and continue to integrate with the document authoring solutions in place.Is it Edge Delivery Service or Edge Delivery Services?Good question. It is Edge Delivery Services, as many different services are involved in delivery at the Edge (close to the customer). There are asset services, authentication services, JSON services, content services, and CDN (Content Delivery Network) services. The Adobe-provided services run on ADOBE IO, a serverless environment.Edge Delivery Services is the final publishing point; many projects provide content for this platform.At the time of writing, there are three providers (in order of appearance):gdocs2md (Google)word2md (Microsoft)html2md (Bring your own markup)The last one supports:Crosswalk, Commerce, and Dark Alley. Universal Editor is something that is sitting on top of Crosswalk (from the perspective of Edge Delivery Services)Project Helix (which was later extended into Franklin) covers delivery, authoring (through Sidekick), and integration (through the Admin API). To refer to the Word and Google integration only as Helix isn't how the Adobe team has been looking at it - and still isn't, as they use Helix now to refer to the same core architecture.Edge Delivery Services (for AEM Sites) includes only the delivery part, as far as the product is packaged. There is no official name for the whole stack.This is a complex relationship, making discussion challenging. I will focus on Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.Each provider creates digital entities that are stored in a content bus. This includes content from cloud-based sources, including code, assets, text, HTML, JSON and configuration data. The platform serves the content bus.It is essential to keep these two entities separate in your mind. There are providers, and Edge Delivery Services is the platform.Why invest in this technology?Performance. Edge Delivery Services is faster, which increases customer engagement. There are lots of studies showing that speed counts. Adobe wants to create the world's fastest websites, so it experimented to see what would happen if all our customers had the world's fastest sites! So Adobe did this.Surely a CDN does this for AEM?It helps, but there is more than just CDN delivery. CDNs are great for global audiences, but users usually have multiple CDNs, dispatcher caches, Akamai, etc. Edge Delivery Services is not a CDN. It sits side by side, feeding one CDN! It runs next to your CDN, not in parallel.What speed do we expect?Lighthouse has its challenges. Edge Delivery Services sends pages optimally, not including any JS cumulative layout shift. If you get 100 on Lighthouse, you will be among the fastest in the world. Adobe aimed for 80-100 for Edge Delivery Services, and they achieved it.Is this just for static content?Great question. The magic is caused by rethinking resources, with a server component that organises the resources and a client part that personalises. Working together, these two parts allow super-fast dynamic page content. Adobe first focused on what was visible to the user, improving static and dynamic pages. There is no such thing as a static page in Edge Delivery Services.Did Adobe create a new JS framework to do this?Current front-end frameworks are designed around limitations in the stack, but browsers have improved, protocols have changed, HTTP/3 is available, and limitations are gone. So Adobe does not call what they are doing a “framework”; it is the web platform. Adobe uses the best bits from the new world. In the old world, software used a bundler to consume assets and placed it on a server for a client to consume. Edge Delivery Services is a no-bundler; source code coordination is used instead. The goal was to make Edge Delivery Services easy to use and make the time to rebuild a site super fast. Instead of incrementally adapting a site to a new design, authors use the tools they have learnt: Excel, Word, Google Drive, etc.What does the platform bring?Performance optimisation: Edge Delivery Services focuses heavily on web performance. It helps serve websites at lightning-fast speeds from edge locations (geographically closer to users) for lower loading times. Unmatched speed – get a Lighthouse reading of 100s.Content at scale: It can handle thousands of pages. Adobe has 300,000+ pages on its website, as Edge Delivery Services pages.Content first: Whether structured or unstructured, AEM prioritises your content, delivers it optimally, and provides your developers with everything they need to make it shine.Enhanced developer experience: Edge Delivery Services empowers developers using modern front-end technologies and frameworks..Real user monitoring (RUM) provides real-time performance metrics, so any dips or issues can be addressed quickly, maintaining a great user experience.Flexibility: Edge Delivery Services is composable, meaning you can use only the specific services you need for your project. No matter where your data is, you can bring it into Edge Delivery Services.Why Edge Delivery Services MattersWebsite speed and user experience are crucial. Edge Delivery Services helps businesses achieve:Faster time to market: Get content updates live much quicker. With its serverless, lightweight approach to web development, Edge Delivery Services allows you to go live in weeks, onboard new developers in days and iterate on changes in minutes. Unlimited preview sites give you confidence that changes will be what you need.Improved SEO: Faster websites get a boost in search rankings.Increased customer engagement: A smooth, fast website keeps users engaged, leading to potentially higher conversion rates.Zero backend development: No building via Maven, Grunt, etc. Edge Delivery Services uses everything modern web developers love: GitHub, local development with auto-reload, performance, and simplicity. And none of the complications: no transpilation, no bundlers, no configurations, no overhead, no pipelines.Low-code productivity: No frameworks, plain HTML, modern CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Simple to onboard devs: no backend (needs repeating!).One less thing to be on call for. Incredible availability due to fully redundant architecture, endless scalability as a full software-as-a-service, and easy integrations with your existing CDN make go-live anxiety a thing of the past.From Cedric Heusler: The short version is that we are building the “bottomless CMS” - a set of CMS services independent of the content. The content is either already in the cloud (SharePoint, etc.) or managed with a domain-specific workflow AND in a CMS. All this content comes together in the brand/enterprise experience.How does Edge Delivery Services differ from AEM?Unlike traditional content management systems (CMSs), this solution does not require a dedicated authoring or publishing environment. Instead, it leverages platforms like Google Drive or SharePoint to create and manage content published directly to Edge Delivery Services for fast and reliable delivery to end-users. This serverless approach eliminates the need for complex infrastructure and maintenance, making it a cost-effective and scalable option for content delivery.Components can be used immediately as the pages have been built beforehand, eliminating the need to wait for a CDN call to the dispatcher or for the components to run on a publisher.No bundling of JS/CSS (Clientlibs).The code relies solely on modern JavaScript and CSS without needing external JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.Pages are controlled through spreadsheets, redirects, indexes, and metadata, all converted into JSON by Edge Delivery Services.Paths in Google Drive/SharePoint control the tree structure of pages.Plug-in tools like Asset Picker from Adobe and Translate from Google can be used.Developers store code in GitHub: no build to deploy.Each branch in GitHub has a separate live preview.Zero pipelines, no delay in publishing. Fast.Did I say fast and easy using tools you already know?To end this introduction, I must create a ‘hello world’ for Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.Code is coordinated by scripts.js in the scripts folder.You can see the code in scripts that control loading:This pattern is known as E-L-D, Eager, Lazy, Delayed, which optimizes the page loading sequence to help us get to the 100/100/100/100 model.Earlier in the sequence, scripts.js inspects the page held in the content bus and modified to be the intermediate state; the code scans for ‘blocks’ and when finding one, it injects the cs and javascript, executing the JS if any is placed in line.Creating HelloWorldI will assume that you have cloned the https://github.com/adobe/aem-boilerplate repo and setup your Edge Delivery Services folder following Getting Started – Developer Tutorial (www.aem.live)To create a simple "Hello World" block in Edge Delivery Services, you'll need to create a CSS file for styling and a JavaScript file for functionality. Here's how you can do it:Create a new folder named "helloworld" in your blocks directory in the GitHub repositoryCreate two files inside the "helloworld" folder: helloworld.css and helloworld.js.In helloworld.css, add the following content:In helloworld.js, add the following content:In your Google document, insert a table, one cell wide and one cell deep.In this cell, add the text ‘helloworld’The existence of the table with the first cell name is the link to the code; Edge Delivery Services looks in the blocks folder and cell-name folder for similarly named js and css, applying the js and the css to the DOM. Magic completed, and the results look like this.Keep reading the series to find out moreRelated ArticlesReturn to Top

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 1This tutorial will guide you through creating your blocks and amending the HTML provided by Edge Delivery Services to ensure that the page has the look and feel you need, with coding examples.Simple web page, served vs renderedHero blockHero block with mobile variationThis is a developer's guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. It assumes you have access to a content team to create the content.I was only joking. Developers can type content.Document-based authoring: Edge Delivery Services allows content creators to use familiar tools like Microsoft Word, Google Docs and spreadsheets to author and structure website content, greatly simplifying the process.All work on a modern website starts with a product owner, a creative person who wants to describe a product or a service. A marketing lead often briefs the product owner. The initial stages usually start with a document, such as Word or Google Docs. The idea is fleshed out and spread around the various teams until everybody is happy with the outcome, messaging and possibly pricing. Sample images and other content are often embedded in the document.This is then sent to the web content team, which will design a new web page in the site hierarchy or a landing page distinct from the rest of the website. Based on the document's contents, the team may have a design ready or commission one.The team then copies and pastes the images and text from the document into ‘components’ placed on a ‘template’ within the CMS. Sometimes, they need to adjust the copy to fit the page template or component. When changes have been made, the copied and pasted text is placed back into the document as a system of record, and when the web page has been published, the amended document is sent back to the product owner.This can be a long process. Perhaps templates and components need building from a busy dev team; the content team is busy creating the next season's campaigns; the author server is down for routine maintenance. The page may not need much design; it may be design-ready with known components, and you might have Franklin (Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services). Good. We will publish the page and step through the processes, adjusting code and styling.If you do not have Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services installed, the tutorial at https://aem.live is easy to follow.Beginning with a simple page,We begin with a simple page, one with a simple title and simple text in Google Docs:The document above is named Hello World, and the text states, “Hello World From Edge Delivery Services.” Pressing the Preview button transfers the document as HTML to Edge Delivery Services’ content bus, which stores all the content for the eventual web pages. We also have a code bus and an asset bus.The system then creates a web page.Not very complicated. Look at the ‘view page source’ code:What happened?The title, og:title and twitter:title were created from the first and only line in the text, and the canonical meta tag and the og:url were created from the page's location, formed by domain name/Google Drive location.Also note that the domain name, in this case main--allaboutv2--ddttom was taken from my GitHub branch, repo name and username. If I created a new branch, say testing, then the domain name would change to testing--allaboutv2--ddttom. The double hyphens -- separate each element. This allows for the testing of new code without breaking the site.A default image tag for ogsecure_url, og:image and twitter:image has been provided. I must provide this default image in my codebase.The viewport tag has been provided.Finally, the scripts aem.js and scripts.js are loadedI have an empty header and footer in my Franklin implementations. If one wants these to be present, one can create them in Google Drive, following similar rules to page creation.The main part of the HTML is a div, followed by a paragraph and text. This is a very simple web page.But what happens inside the browser?You will see that the DOM has been adjusted or decorated. This is by design. Franklin provides the document in a raw HTML format with known patterns. It is up to the developers to shape the HTML to the end requirements.Franklin has added the HTML to load our CSS through style sheets. Two different patterns are used: styles.css and lazy-style.css. As the document is processed, there are three phases: load-eager, load-page, and load-lazy. Load-eager gets the important “before the fold” stuff and everything needed to get the page set up as quickly as possible; load-page is our normal run-of-the-mill stuff, and load-lazy is for actions that don’t matter, such as animations. Further details will be provided later.Franklin has injected extra scripts into the header, inspecting the raw HTML and deciding which components are used. In our case, we have a header and a footer (though both are blank). Franklin has decided that we are using the header and footer components. Franklin calls the components ‘blocks,’ so it adds the CSS to the DOM and runs the JS from the same folder..We are using modern JavaScript techniques in Franklin, so the JavaScript is dynamically imported, similar to:Although it uses a more elegant method.The JavaScript that comes with the blocks can modify and shape the DOM to match the styling requirements. This is a more advanced technique that will be explained later.The standard “out of the box” causes the body element to be non-displayed.You should also note that we are using CSS3 variables in our CSS.When the page is finally ready to be seen, the class “appear” is applied to the body, and the page becomes visible, thus stopping any flashes of unstyled content.Semantic header and footer elements are added to the DOM, and wrappers are added as a class to each part. The document is split into sections, only one in this raw case. As the JS runs for each ‘block’ or ‘section’, a data-block-status or a section-block-status class with a value of “loaded” is added; this will help prevent this fraction of the DOM from being handled more than once. It's also a signal to the CSS to action new styles.The raw line of text is given a <div class=”default-content-wrapper”>In summary, Franklin applies clever conventions on top of the Google/Word Doc, sending minimal HTML to the browser with minimal JavaScript, preferably over an HTTP/3 channel. The JavaScript inspects the HTML and then decorates it by following rules.We have yet to discover the rules in this document. As there is no configuration in the document, Franklin uses a technique known as auto-blocking, which uses ‘smart algorithms’ to understand the author's intent.What’s this about rules?Documents need descriptions, titles, etc. Franklin tries to provide them, but it would be better if the author had control. In document authoring, we use tables to give rules.The image above shows our document with a table with two columns. The first row is merged and given the name ‘metadata’. This is the clue to Franklin to use this information to adjust the metadata in the HTML.The left column contains the key phrase, and the right column contains the content. It is traditional to place this table at the foot of the document.What this metadata does to our HTMLIn this HTML, you can see that the title matches our title and that the description is mapped to the description fields in the og:description and twitter:description fields.A new meta field has been added:<meta name="keywords" content="Explanatory, web, page, hello, world">This ability to add rules to the document is key to creating interesting web pages.We can add one of the built-in rules. If they contain code and styling, they are called blocks.Add a block called columns:Now inspect the view page source. We will only look at <main> as we have not changed the metadata.The block name (columns) is now held within a div element with a class of “columns.” This signals Franklin to adjust the DOM, as we will see later.Although we used a table to define our block, Franklin used div elements to separate each cell. We have not gone back in time and are about to style tables. Franklin is much smarter than that.Inspecting the rendered DOM, where .…. represents unchanged partsThe image in og:image and ogsecure_url has been replaced from the default with the URL for the image in the metadata table.This is our first time using an image in our sample document. You will notice that the doc format has embedded the image into the document, and its original name is lost. Franklin creates a unique ID. If the same image is used in multiple places, the ID is the same; it is a hash of the image. You will notice in the HTML a query string: ?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium"The &#x26; is an HTML entity representing the ampersand character (&). It is inserted in the string to disambiguate the parameters. So, it states that the image should be resized to 1200 pixels in width and served as a progressive jpeg with medium optimisation. Noting this, it is best to provide an image 1200 pixels wide in the image metadata portion of the page. Franklin will stretch or shrink your image to fit if you do not.We will add images to our simple website and see what Franklin offers later.The CSS for columns has been added to the DOM:At the same time as this decoration, the js in /blocks/columns/columns.js has been imported and executed.A div with class=”columns-wrapper” has been added to the DOM just before the text.The original div class = ”columns” has been extended, and new classes have been added: block to inform Franklin that this is a block and columns-2-cols to ensure that the correct styling for a two-column div is applied.The code in column.js does this decoration to transform the raw HTML into a structure that can be styled.The code above reads the number of divs in the first child and gets the count; it then adds the class with a count derived from the number of children.The last part of the js looks for picture elements - added at the document level - and decorates the cell with columns-img-col if found.Adjusting our document and placing the same image at the top of the page, with author details.I have opened the image options panel in Google Drive to show the placement of alt text and title of this image. I am using the same image as I used in the metadata; we will be able to see the different treatments given to the image by Edge Delivery Services.Preview the page in the browser.Inspecting the view page source, from main onwards:Keep in mind the original og:image metadata:<meta property="og:image" content="https://main--allaboutv2--ddttom.hlx.page/media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpeg?width=1200&#x26;format=pjpg&#x26;optimize=medium">The HTML provided shows that the picture element was used. The HTML picture element is a powerful tool for creating websites. It allows web developers to specify multiple image sources, ensuring the browser displays the most appropriate image for the user's device and network conditions. Additionally, the picture element provides a fallback mechanism for browsers not supporting it, ensuring users always see some form of the image.The picture element constructed has the following pattern. I have abstracted the name and shortened the optimisation part to show the layout.This element has media query conditions that choose the correct width for a mobile device (min-width:600). There are format options to choose WebP (format=webply) or JPEG (format=jpeg). The browser will use this mix to select the correct image for the viewport size and browser capabilities. Finally, there is a fallback - for browsers or tools that need help understanding the picture element (few these days).Inspecting the HTML code reveals that the same image is used everywhere as the source. The query-string modifier changes what is served to the browser. In our case:./media_145e13ea388af99109b4e34d2c57d40f5fc22d9c9.jpegCreating a bio blockWe will improve the content team's experience by creating a bio block and writing some JavaScript and CSS to add the image title as a byline for the bio. Search for the meta author if the image does not contain a title.<meta name="author" content="Tom Cranstoun">The first step is to extend the page metadata table to add a new entry: author. Remember, the first column is case-insensitive, but the second is not.The next step is encapsulating the content in a new bio block and adding the text underneath.Now, we must style the block and write the JavaScript to decorate it however we want.Inspect the new block “bio” when looking at the view source page for the raw HTML:We know that Edge Delivery Services decorates our block when it downloads; looking at the rendered DOM, just the bio block:We see that the <div class=”bio”> has been replaced with<div class="bio-wrapper"><div class="bio block" data-block-name="bio" data-block-status="loaded">This allows us to target CSS onto the block.We will put the bio picture into a circle.The CSS styling is stored in /blocks/bio/bio.cssDeveloper Guide to document authoring with Edge Delivery ServicesWe now want to add some JavaScript to retrieve the alt text or, if not present, read the meta name=author content into a Javascript variable named author, using the variable to enhance the bio element display. The content team no longer need to write the author's name if the metadata is correct, either on the alt or the meta author tag.Create the new \blocks\bio\bio.jsPreviewing the page:By adding classes, we can create variations of our block. We add extra names in brackets after the block's name. We now create a highlighted variation of the bio block.We adjust our styling in \blocks\bio\bio.cssAs we have the circle (border-radius….), the browser version now shows the image with a 2px blue border.The ability to create many block variations is a powerful feature that can add visual interest and interactivity to a web page. Using styling and JavaScript introspection, unique and engaging blocks can be created.Here are some examples of how styling and JavaScript introspection can be used to create block variations:Styling:Use different colours, fonts and sizes to create various visual styles.Add borders, shadows and other effects to create depth and dimension.Use CSS animations and transitions to create dynamic effects.JavaScript introspection:Use JavaScript to get and set the properties of a block.Use JavaScript to add and remove event listeners to a block.Use JavaScript to create custom animations and interactions.Here are some additional tips for creating variations of a block:Use a consistent design system:This will help ensure your blocks have a cohesive look and feel.Start with a simple design:This will make it easier to add variations later.Use modular components:This will make it easier to reuse code and create new variations.Test your variations:This will help to ensure that your variations work as expected.By combining styling and JavaScript introspection, blocks can be created that are visually appealing and interactive, creating a more engaging and enjoyable user experience.Creating a hero blockA hero block, frequently called the hero image or hero banner, is crucial at the start of many web pages. This large, page-wide image is strategically positioned to capture the visitor's attention upon landing immediately.We begin by inserting a table in the document. The first cell is named Hero, and the image is in the second cell.When we preview this, the hero takes up the entire screen width.Even when viewed on a mobile device, it looks good.You may remember that Edge Delivery Services makes a fresh version at different resolutions (picture element, media-query), transforming JPEG into WebP format. This may distort the mobile view by crushing the pixels, giving you a fuzzy appearance.You may want a different hero on a mobile, which is an editorial decision. The auto-scaled version of the desktop hero sometimes needs to be fixed for a mobile hero.How do we do this? With a slight modification of the hero table and a bit of JavaScript.Add a suitable mobile image in a two-cell wide table.When this is previewed, we are shocked. It is not what we wanted. We ended up with the second image as the hero; the desktop image got lost.Looking at the rendered HTML:Add code to the hero block.As expected, we see two picture elements. We need to decorate this part of the site to combine them. By convention, the first row is the desktop image, and the second is the mobile image.We add code to the empty \blocks\hero\hero.jsThe code performs manipulations on the picture elements. It starts by selecting two <picture> elements: the first one is located inside the first <div> element within an element with the class name hero, and the second one is located inside the second <div> element within the first <div> element of the hero class.If both these <picture> elements exist, the code proceeds to do the following:1. It selects the second <source> element from the second <picture> element.2. If the second <source> element exists, it creates a copy of it.3. It then checks if the first <picture> element has a second <source> element.If it does, the code replaces the existing second <source> element in the first <picture> element with the copied <source> element from the second <picture> element.If it doesn't, the code adds the copied <source> element as a new child of the first <picture> element.4. Finally, the code removes the document's second <picture> element.If only one picture element exists, the code does nothing, and the hero still works.Just a little touch of magic.See the screenshots below:Desktop imageMobile imageFinally, the rendered picture elements - following the adjustments:The two picture elements have been merged into one.All this work has been done without affecting the Lighthouse page speed.If you follow along, you will have a very similar page.

It has a hero and a bio block, with the line of text “Hello World From Edge Delivery Services.”We added a metadata table at the bottom of the document, and the entries became metadata on the final web page.We added JavaScript to the hero block to allow the hero to contain two distinct images: one for mobile and one for desktop. The picture element selected these depending on the viewport size. We created the bio block from scratch, with styling to create a circular overlay and to pick up the author's name from either the alt tag in the img element and, if not present, obtain the author’s name from the author meta element from the page. We added a class name ‘highlighted’ to our Bio block and the CSS to put an outline on the image.Continuing the journeyOur manager has asked that we follow the image with some text with brief biographical details, including the author's name. Thus, we no longer need the author's name automatically provided underneath the picture. This is another variation.The cell in the block name is currently Bio (highlighted). The word bio is the block name and also the class name used to create the element and its wrappers; looking at the rendered HTML in the browser after Edge Delivery Services has run, one of the first things to note is that the blocks we created have been rendered in a div with a section class.<div class="section hero-container bio-container columns-container" data-section-status="loaded" style="">The div also has classes for each block in the document, postfixed with -container. There is a data-section-status class that is adjusted by edge delivery and, finally, an empty style; we will return to section styles later. Further down, we see the bio-blockIn the snippet of HTML, the block is decorated with a -wrapper <div class="bio-wrapper">, and the next div is decorated with the block name ‘bio’ and the variation ‘highlighted’ along with a ‘block’ class.<div class="bio highlighted block" data-block-name="bio" data-block-status="loaded">All blocks are decorated this way: block name, variations applied and then ‘block’. This makes it easy to target slices of the HTML using classes; Edge Delivery Services does not use IDs.Hiding the auto-generated author-nameOur task is to hide the author, so adding a new class name, “hide author”, is done by adding a second phrase after a comma within the brackets. All spaces in the block/styling phrase are replaced with hyphens (-)Investigating the rendered HTML.We can adjust the CSS or JS to make this class work. I chose to adjust the javascript, adding a test for the non-existence of the class ‘hide-author.’The final Javascript functionPlace the text to the right.The next task was to allow text to the right of our bio picture. Insert a new column, merge the title and add the text.Previewing could be better; the text is underneath.It looks OK, but we wanted something else. We want the text to be to the right. Adding CSS to bio.css to involve a flex layout does the trick.We adjusted the first and last child of the DIVs to make it workReusing contentContent Management Systems often reuse pieces of text and assets; Edge Delivery Services include this functionality; these are called fragments.I create fragments in a folder called fragments in my Google Drive. We want boilerplate text at the foot of our pages, similar to the ‘Want to know more’ at the bottom of these articles.We create the fragment.And add the contentWe need to include this fragment in our page by adding a fragment block with the path of the fragment.When previewed, we can now see the fragment on our page.The ‘want to know more’ fragment is displayed on the page; it is interesting to see how Edge Delivery Services provides this snippet; we inspect the network traffic.This time, you can see the fetch/xhr content in my filter, and the fragment component asked for want-to-know-more-plain.html instead of Edge Delivery providing a page with styling, javascript, <body>, <main>, etc.; it just provided the raw HTML in a div ready for adding to the page; where it will inherit the styling and context of the page.Looking more carefully, you wiil also see footer.plain.html and nav.plain.htmlThese are ‘auto fragments’ generated from the footer and nav documents placed in the root folder of Google Drive. This gives the website a consistent set of headers and footers.I want my allabout.network to be focussed on telling people ‘all about’ something, such as this tutorial, without third-party distractions. Therefore, I have also chosen not to have footers or navigation; you can easily create your navigation and footers and have them auto-included as fragments.Styling the pagesThere are three ways to style your pages.Use the default autoblock style.Change nothing; get the style verbatim from styles.css. You can view and change the styles in styles.css for your project. Note that the style sheets in Edge Delivery use CSS 3 with variables; it does not require bundling, compiling, or transpilation.Use a themeAfter applying the theme's name to your metadata table, Edge Delivery Services will apply the theme class to the body. Then, you can change the styling for this page using the theme as a modifier; for instance, a newsletter page could have a theme of ‘newsletter’; as I am writing an article, I will give this page a theme of ‘article’.Edge Delivery Services applies the theme class to the body element.One can use different styles on this page, such as margin padding.Note that the body class has a display: none; when Edge Delivery finishes loading the page, it changes the display attribute by adding a class “appear” with a display “block”Use sectionsSections are parts of the page; they are marked by ‘---’ 3 hyphens on a line by themselves and have a section metadata table.Preview the pageThe rendered HTML for a section looks like this:The description metadata is used as a data-description attribute in the section div. You can use these data descriptions to decorate the HTML further, but this will be custom code.The Hello World page is here.https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/hello-world-2A Manager’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services

This is a manager's guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Although Edge Delivery Services is a serverless platform provided and maintained by Adobe, setting up the web hosting, GitHub, CDN (content delivery network) and DNS (domain name system) management requires some technical skill. This post assumes you have access to a technical team to do this with you.I cover some of the technical aspects in a developer’s guide to Edge Delivery Services post here:https://allabout.network/developer-guide-to-document-authoring-with-edge-delivery-servicesThis guide provides an overview of how Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services functions. It is designed for managers who require a high-level understanding of the services but do not need to be involved in the developer detail.Here are the key points to understand:Purpose: Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services enables organisations to create, manage and deliver rich, interactive documents with near-instantaneous load times and fast turnaround from concept to go-to-market, with A/B testing.Improved user experience: Documents load quickly, providing users with a seamless and engaging experience.Increased productivity: Authors can create and update documents efficiently, as changes are reflected quickly.Cost savings: Organisations can reduce infrastructure costs by leveraging Edge Delivery Services.Scalability: The service is highly scalable, ensuring that documents can be delivered to many users without performance issues.Components:Authoring environment: Authors use Google or Word documents to create and edit web pages. Spreadsheets to provide configuration.Edge delivery network: Documents are cached on edge servers strategically located worldwide, ensuring fast delivery to users.Content delivery network: Documents are delivered to users from the nearest edge server, reducing latency and improving performance.Technical setup:Infrastructure: A technical team is required to set up the necessary infrastructure, DNS, GitHub and CDN.Integration: The service can integrate with existing content management systems and workflows.Documentation/manuals: Deliver complex technical documentation with interactive diagrams, videos and simulations.Marketing collateral: Create engaging marketing materials such as brochures, presentations and reports.Training materials: Develop interactive training modules that can be accessed from anywhere.Legal documents: Share legal documents with clients and partners securely and efficiently.Landing pages: Create campaign landing pages, pages for sharing with social media, etcEverything discussed below is identical if you have an existing Word or Google Doc. I will demonstrate importing an existing web page into the system.Consider a web page such asThe AI Tipping Point: A Consultant's Takeaways from CMS Kickoff 2024 | CMS CriticIf we want to convert this page to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services, we start with the AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) import command. The importer is currently named Franklin Import UI. Franklin is one of the internal product names; another used in the codebase is Helix. Helix refers to the DNA spiral and is used as a meme throughout the documentation and developer “getting started “ site: https://www.aem.live/homeI will continue to user Franklin in this document.The Edge Delivery Services platform provides the security, scalability, and speed that Adobe offers for websites. Franklin is an individual project that utilizes the Edge Delivery Services content bus.The platform also includes other projects discussed in a separate blog post.The importer reads the website and recognises the main content, removing the adverts. It then saves the content as a Word document. We edit the document to remove the menu hangover in Word or Google Docs and add a heading title format. That's all we have to do. The document is ready for Edge Delivery Services.Upload to Google Drive (or SharePoint)In Google Drive (or SharePoint), we can use the document's normal workflows, plugins, and tools, including translation, AI content enhancement, etc.When we are ready, press Preview to check the website. Then press Publish, and the web page will be complete and ready for the public.This technique is called ‘autoblocking’ in the Franklin project. We have not created any components, added fancy tags, or used JavaScript Blocks on the web page. We have taken a basic article with images and turned it into a reasonable web page. Franklin has preserved font emboldening, heading levels, and links and loosely styled them all, which Edge Delivery Services will serve fast.Franklin understands the document's headings (h1, h2, etc.) and applies these values to the final web page. Franklin also understands bold, italic, and underlining. Franklin understands the Courier font as a code marker and outputs the content raw, without font decoration.Adding new itemsWe want to be creative and add new items to our site. Let's explain how that works.In the GitHub repository, we store individual code and styling in blocks. Your developers take care of these, and your integrator or developer team will provide some additional blocks.When applying code or styling to a fraction of our web page, one adds a table with the block's name. Let’s add a centreblock:This text will be centred on the web page. That’s all we have to do. If we wanted to do more, we could have various code and styling blocks, say, accordions, tabs, etc.Many out-of-the-box blocks are available for Franklin; see Block Collection.Further down the page, you will see Block Party.One can add teasers, heroes, accordions, tabs, etc. Your developers can create many more.MetadataAnother feature of Franklin is a special block embedded in the HTML page containing the content and the values to be used as metadata. This block describes the page to external systems and configures the page for the Franklin project.In each row below, the first column is the metadata keyword, and the second column is the value of the metadata element. We have multiple items: one for the page title, one for the page description; one for an image, and one for a line of extra data. The case is ignored in the first column. The metadata table is typically placed at the foot of the document, though this is not a requirement.This metadata translates into the final HTMLI will cover metadata in detail in the developer's guide. It's good to know that Franklin covers metadata, that it is easily maintained by the content team, and that it may be used by Google or other indexers. Franklin may also use the metadata to change the page layout.Preview and publishFranklin contains a toolbar that allows authorised users to preview or publish pages via the Edge Delivery Services platform.Pressing Preview allows the content author to see the final page, and then pressing Publish sends the page and its assets—the content, media, and code buses—to the public store.The publish bus system stores the various elements of the web page in a publicly visible cloud storage system where the code bus provides the final code needed to serve the web page to the public. The Adobe code in the code bus is started by a JavaScript file embedded in the HTML, named aem.js. This orchestrates the delivery and sequencing of the assets, the other code blocks and only the blocks required for the current page. This is a speedy delivery, made faster by a bring-your-own CDN such as Fastly.The assets bus provides images in a suitably rendered format using HTML picture elements, keeping the website fast and performant on mobile websites.A properly implemented Edge Delivery Services page should have a great Core Web Vitals or Lighthouse score.Lighthouse performance scoring | Chrome for DevelopersThe Lighthouse score for this page is below:The great score 100/100/100/100 comes out of the box. As you add scripts, especially third-party or monitoring scripts, you must continually monitor the performance to ensure the site performs as expected. Adobe provides great tools in the Franklin ecosystem, such as real user monitoring (RUM) and performance checks on GitHub. It helps you ensure you keep world-class speeds. Any Lighthouse score above 80 is at the top of the web.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 3SpreadsheetsIndexingSpreadsheets and JsonQuery parametersRedirects.helix folderThis is part 3 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services.We extended ‘Hello World’ with style variations on the bio block, added fragments, and discussed styling in more depth.Next - We can use spreadsheets, not just documents.Within Google Drive or Sharepoint, you can upload or create spreadsheets in Excel or Google Sheets format. If you are using Google Drive, remember to change your settings to convert Excel to Google Sheets automatically,How to Convert Multiple Word Documents/Sheets to Google Docs.Using spreadsheetsSpreadsheets are versatile tools that can be used for various purposes. In this post, we will explore some of the most common uses for spreadsheets, including:Source of JSON for your website: Spreadsheets can create JSON data that populates Edge Delivery Services pages or another website using ‘headless technologies’ such as react.js. They are a convenient way to store and manage data that needs to be displayed on a website.Notification of events from Edge Delivery Services: Spreadsheets can be used to receive notifications of events from Edge Delivery Services. This can be useful for monitoring your website's performance or troubleshooting issues. The Spreadsheets created can be used on your website; we will demo this.Configuration of Edge Delivery Services: Spreadsheets can be used to configure Edge Delivery Services. This optimises your website's performance or enables specific features like headers, metadata, and authentication.1 Use a spreadsheet as a source of JSON for websites.One can create a spreadsheet in MS Excel and upload it to Google Drive or create one directly inside Google Drive. For the demo, we will create a fortune cookie block in our document that displays a random cookie from a JSON file named cookies.In Google Drive, create a folder named /data; in that folder, create a sheet named cookies.The first row of the sheet becomes the json attribute names.We now want a list of cookies, and I will get chatGPT to give me a list of 9Press the preview button in the sidekick to see a nice json layout; I use json view.Investigating the structure of the json.The JSON structure consists of an object with several properties:1. "total": A number representing the total count of data elements.2. "offset": A number indicating the starting position of the data subset.3. "limit": A number specifying the maximum number of data elements in this subset.4. "data": An array containing the actual data elements. Each element is an object with two properties:- "key": A string representing the message's short title- "value": A string containing the actual message.5. ":type": A string indicating the type of data, in this case, "sheet", the source of the dataIn simple terms:- The object has metadata about the data set, including the total number of elements, the offset and limit for this subset of data (useful for pagination), and the data type.- The actual data is in the "data" array.All JSON derived from spreadsheets in Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services share the same formatting; the main json is in the ‘data’ element, and everything else is metadata.We would like to build a fortune cookie block.Start by creating a table ‘FortuneCookie’ in our Hello World document.Remember that the name cell, the only cell in the case above, is changed to lowercase when used in Edge Delivery Services.In our GitHub, we need to createblocks/fortunecookie/fortunecookie.css andblocks/fortunecookie/fortunecookie.jsThe code in fortunecookie.js will use the browser's fetch command to read the json, generate a random number, use that number to pluck a key and a value, and then place the results in the block.Viewing the pageWe now have a Fortune Cookie on our page. You can add any JSON to your pages by using spreadsheets when someone presses preview and publish.Spreadsheets and JSONIn addition to translating Google Docs and Word documents into markdown and HTML markup, AEM also translates spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel workbooks and Google Sheets) into JSON files that your website or web application can easily consume.This enables many uses for content that is table-oriented or structured.Sheets and Sheet Structure.The simplest example of a sheet consists of a table that uses the first row as column names and the subsequent rows as data, as seen above.Edge Delivery Services allows you to manage workbooks with multiple sheets.If there is only one sheet, Edge Delivery Services will use that sheet as the default source of information.Edge Delivery Services will only deliver sheets with sheet names prefixed with helix if there are multiple sheets. This lets you keep additional information and possibly formulas in the same spreadsheet that will not be delivered to the web.If there is a sheet named helix-default, it is delivered if no additional query parameters are supplied.See the following for details on how to query a specific sheet.Query ParametersOffset and LimitSpreadsheets and JSON files can become very large. In such cases, Edge Delivery Services supports limit and offset query parameters to indicate which spreadsheet rows are delivered.As Edge Delivery Services always compresses the JSON, payloads are generally relatively small. Therefore, if the limit query parameter is not specified, the Edge Delivery Services limits the number of rows it returns to 1000 by default. This is sufficient for many simple cases.SheetThe sheet query parameter allows an application to specify one or multiple specific sheets in the spreadsheet or workbook. For example,?sheet=jobs will return the sheet named helix-jobs, and ?sheet=jobs&sheet=articles will return the data for helix-jobs and helix-articles.2 Notification of events from Edge Delivery ServicesThe empty sheetEdge Delivery Services keeps a json index of all published pages; in Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services, you can have a copy of this index by creating a sheet in the root folder of your document store. This sheet must be named query-index and have a single sheet named raw_index. The columns are path, title, image, description and lastmodified. You can choose to add others like ‘author’. See indexingWhen you publish a page, Edge Delivery automatically enters it into this spreadsheet with updated attributes and publishes the sheet. It's a two-way traffic sheet.Using this documentation website as an exampleAnd when we previewThis json file can be used in Edge Delivery Services to create dynamic blocks, where the content is pulled from a json file.Creating a BlogList, using index-query.jsonWe added a bloglist block to the document.We will create the bloglist code at/blocks/bloglist/bloglist.css and/blocks/bloglist/bloglist.jsBloglist JavascriptThe javascript will also use fetch, which is similar to the fortunecookie block. We want to obtain the json, restrict it to just my blogs, sort by title, and then restrict the final json to three entries. You can see four entries in the sample above.Create the BlogList stylePreviewing the page3 Configuring Edge Delivery ServicesEdge Delivery Services is controlled in many ways; spreadsheets are the content Author-friendly way of performing this task.You have seen that we created a query-index sheet in our root folder. This is a two-way sheet that receives information from the publishing process and can be used to create dynamic content for your pages.Edge Delivery Services also has a sheet named redirects, which creates the json entity redirects.jsonIn this sheet, we have two columns: Source and Destination.I made the mistake of creating my blogs in the root folder of my Google Drive, and I did not similarly name them, so I moved them to a subtree ‘/blogs/ddt’ and created the redirects sheet in the root of the folder.I also deleted the original pages, so you are redirected to the new destination when you ask for the older location: nice one, Adobe. Thinking about your hierarchy before you begin is preferable, but knowing that you can change it afterwards is nice.The .helix folderYou can control the inner workings of Edge Delivery services using the folder named .helixNote the ‘.’ -- it is dot-helix .helixNote the name is a previous code name for this technology. The dot in front makes this folder unservable from the internet, which is excellent for secrets like how you are configuring Edge Delivery Services. You could think of the ‘.’ as just like the dot in Unix -- files are hidden!!Anyway, the files you create in this folder are used for configuring HelixHeadersThe sheet ‘headers’, which in turn ought to create headers,json - you cannot see this file, contains the key and value of the headers you want to send out with your web pages.My headers contain a content security policy, which helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.Link to CSP Description on MozillaBringing up the sidekickWhen you click on preview, instead of a new set of options, including publish, you get a transient sign ‘Configuration successfully activated’.Because this is in the .helix folder, it does not need publishing -- it is not visible to the internet.ConfigThe next sheet to look at is config; you put interesting things here for your configuration.Part of mine is shown below; keys and secrets are here to configure CDN and caching; you can also configure authentication. I will not show you my samples for the obvious reasons.You can find more info about the ‘.helix’ folder and metadata config here.https://www.aem.live/docs/bulk-metadataMy next post will be about tips and tricks with Json, including building a react application inside Edge Delivery Services.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 4Building an SPA app with JsonThis is part 4 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. This time, we will create an SPA app.We demonstrated how spreadsheets can serve as a JSON source for websites and Edge Delivery Services, as well as for notifications and configuration purposes.Part 4 - Building an App with JsonI will first create an application in Edge Delivery Services and then extend this to a React application. Edge Delivery Services supports react and vue; one does not get the perfect 100,100,100,100 lighthouse scoring when we move to Single Page Applications (SPAs), though we get enhanced user interactions. This article shows how Edge Delivery Services can assist customers in building the best of both worlds. Architects should ensure that the home, campaign, and direct landing pages are built with pure Edge Delivery Services code; secondary pages can be more interactive, keeping the website's performance high. Like all rules, you can choose to disregard this one.The app we build will demonstrate that Edge Delivery Services is not just for static pages.Specification of the AppThe app is a slideshow designed for content authors who create individual pages.In a ‘traditional CMS, ’ this would probably be a pool of images in an extendable component, which is difficult for a content author to use. We will build a design focused on the content author.Each page will also serve as a standalone entity, with a visually appealing slide image complemented by detailed textual content. The code's primary objective is to extract metadata from each page, represented as a JSON object. This metadata is then employed to showcase the slides in a continuous scrolling format, providing users with an immersive experience; each slide is linked to its corresponding page, enabling seamless navigation for users seeking additional information or exploring the content in greater depth.This feature enhances the user experience by allowing easy access to supplementary materials, fostering a more interactive and informative environment.Creating the documentsCreate a folder ‘slides’ in the root folder of our Google Drive, and create our page in this folder.As a subject, I will create slides about York, the English city where I live. I will create five pages with images and information. The code will not be restricted to five pages; use as many as you need.My pages will be simple to show the context of creating an SPA, and the layout will beTitle, Image, Descriptive text, MetadataSimilar to this, each page is different, and it will expand on the text.Accessing the pagesQuery-indexAll pages created? Add a query-index spreadsheet in the folder; we covered this in part three when we created a query-index in the root folder. As a reminder, we want a blank like this.Now preview and publish the pages.Edge Delivery Services populates the query-indexWe can look at the jsonWe should create the landing page.“Five things to do in York, England”In this page we added a single block ‘slide builder’; which will contain the JavaScript and styling for our SPA.Remember that Edge Delivery Services replace non-printing, and strange characters with hyphens; we need to create our files in/blocks/slide-builder/slide-builder.css/blocks/slide-builder/slide-builder.jsThe JS is the first thing I will create. We use ‘fetch’ to obtain the json from our query-index in the slides folder of the Google Drive, iterate over every entry and make the initial page markup.We will develop the code step by step.As usual, we start with our export statement; it is good practice to do thisWe have started with a query to check if WebP, high-speed images, is supported.We will layer this up as we go through the tutorial.Fetch the slidesThere are two functions here; the first fetch retrieves the query-index inside the /slides/ folder, which lists the published slide we saw in the json above.However, each slide page has information we want for the SPA, a hero-type image with variations for mobile etc, the intro para and detailed paragraphs; we need to pick those up too. We bypass this in a mobile view (viewport <800). In the mobile view, the html is replaced by a null. The fetchSlideHtml function appends ‘.plain.html’ to the path; this signals to Edge Delivery Services to treat the page as a fragment and only return plain html without a header footer or any javascript - just plain html.If returned, it is stored in the json for later use.Next step, add the slides.We Iterate over the json and call functions to build our app; we use an intersection observer feature to lazy load our images. That bit that says rootMargin: 100px is the wiggle room for our image coming into view.Create each slideThe createSlideItem function builds all of the html necessary to display an individual slide, adding a click handler, which creates a panel; if we are running on a desktop, it adds additional supporting text (the first paragraph from the HTML) to the slide.This technique speeds up mobile whilst keeping the desktop view enriched. The design is mobile-first, desktop-enriched.The CreatePanel FunctionIn the createPanel we check to see if the HTML is present to display; if not we fetch it. Remember it is not present on the mobile view; keeping this responsive and fast. We add the controls to dismiss the panel.FetchSupportingText FunctionThe FetchSupportingText function reads the HTML, if present, from the html node of the Json, parses it with the Dom Parser and extracts the first paragraph after the first h2 element. This is an essential technique in Edge Delivery Services; the web uses modern javascript, and the browsers fully support parsing DOM structures. Edge Delivery services treat the DOM as a first-class citizen, tying this with ‘plain.html’, and developers have a rich resource set.Setting the background imageTwo things are happening here: the url is constructed from the original image url, which was present in the metadata, and therefore, the image node of the json. We use the supportsWebP variable to adjust the image for WebP serving from Edge Delivery, set width and optimise level through a query string. We go for the original image if the browser does not support WebP.Notice that we have img.onload and image.onerror functions to support lazy loading.That was a lot to coverHere is the complete listingCompleting the ask, the CSSPhew that is complicated; by breaking it into smaller pieces, I hope you see that the design fits together and you will be able to build SPA Applications with query-index.json and .plain.htmlWe managed to keep great lighthouse scores despite using lots of fetch and stitching together. Edge Delivery Services is a wonderful tool.The finished Spa App is here Five things to do in York, England (allabout.network)In contrast, we can convert this into a ReactJS application and serve it directly from Edge Delivery Services, which will be the next part of this series.All Developer Articles

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 5Building a ReactJS appThis is part 5 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. This time, we will create a React App that uses Edge Delivery Services as the data source.We created a SPA app using Documents as the data source and a document with a block to serve the content.Part 5 - Building a React app with documents as the sourceAs a developer, you may be more familiar with ReactJs and want to use those skills in Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. You may also have an existing ReactJs app that you want to bring into the Edge Delivery Services Infrastructure. Whatever your reason, this tutorial will help you use ReactJs with Edge Delivery.I walk you through converting the slide builder block we built in part 4 into a modular React app. We'll cover the key steps and considerations to ensure a smooth transition.1. Understanding the Original StructureThe original approach was a block consisting of a single JavaScript file (slide-builder.js) and a corresponding CSS file (slide-builder.css). This monolithic approach worked well within the Edge Delivery Services ecosystem, it needs modularity to work well with React.2. Breaking Down the ComponentsThe first step in our conversion is to identify the main components of our application:- SlideBuilder: The main container for all slides- SlideItem: Individual slide components- SlidePanel: The panel that opens when a slide is clicked3. Setting Up the React ProjectStart by creating a new React project. You can use Create React App or your preferred React boilerplate.After creating a new React project with the Create React App, you can streamline your project by removing several files that aren't necessary for our conversion. Here's a list of files you can safely delete:1. In the `src` folder:- `App.test.js` (We are a tutorial, no tests. Do this later)- `logo.svg` (the React logo, which we won't be using)- `reportWebVitals.js` (we will not need web vitals reporting)- `setupTests.js` (no tests, see above)2. In the `public` folder:- `logo192.png` and `logo512.png` (React logos)- `manifest.json` (We are not building a Progressive Web App)- we can delete favicon.ico- `robots.txt`Rename index.html to slides.htmlAfter cleaning up, your project structure might look like this:This cleaned-up structure provides a good starting point for implementing your converted React application. You can now add your new components and styles to the `src` folder. The final project structure will end up like this.The index.html<!DOCTYPE html>Now app.jsInstead of directly fetching data in the decorate function, I used React's useEffect hook in the App component to fetch slide data when the component mounts.app.cssWe employ hooks such as React, useState, and useEffect in React. Additionally, we integrate the SlideBuilder component and the App.css file. The App function component serves as the foundation of our application. With the assistance of the useState hook, we effectively manage the "slides" state. To retrieve slide data upon component mounting, we utilize the useEffect hook. The fetchSlides function, an asynchronous operation, acquires slide data from the "/slides/query-index.json" endpoint. The component structure encompasses a header and a primary section. Within the main section, the SlideBuilder component is rendered, passing slide data as a property.index.js, remove core web vitalsChange README.md4. Creating React ComponentsNow, let's create our React components:- src/components/SlideBuilder.js- src/components/SlideItem.js- src/components/SlidePanel.jsDon’t worry about dangerouslySetInnerHTML. I only obtained a text node in the first place.Each component encapsulates its logic and render method.The core logic from the original `decorate` function was distributed among these components:- Moved slide fetching logic to the main App component- Implemented background image loading in SlideItem- Handled panel opening/closing in SlideItem and SlidePanel5. StylingCreate separate CSS files for each component:- src/styles/SlideBuilder.css- src/styles/SlideItem.css- src/styles/SlidePanel.cssBuild the outputTo distribute your React application, you must create a production build and then deploy it. Here's a step-by-step guide on what you need to do:Create a Production Build:In your project directory, run the following:npm run buildThis command creates a build directory with a production build of your app.The build directory will contain:To distribute your app, you need to serve the contents of the build directory.Returning to our Edge Delivery Services repository, it looks similar to the archetypal boilerplate.Copy the internal part of the build folder, the static folder and the index.html to the root of the Edge Delivery RepoNow, the Repo is integrated, as seen below.We have added slides.html and the static directory.Now commit and push your Repo.ConclusionConverting an Edge Delivery Services block to a React application involves breaking down the monolithic structure into reusable components, adapting the logic to work with React's lifecycle and hooks, and ensuring that all functionality is preserved. While it requires some effort, the result is an extensible codebase that leverages the power of React's component-based architecture. I prefer the block format; this tutorial is to help give you options.Remember, this conversion is just the beginning. Once in React, you can further enhance your application with additional features, optimize performance, and integrate with other React libraries and tools. If your customer already has a ReactJS application, a calculator, or something more sophisticated, you can easily integrate this into your Edge Delivery Services site collection.The final ReactJS application, served directly from GitHub, cannot be previewed using the sidekick and thus cannot be published through it. Despite this, it is live. You can view it here https://allabout.network/slides.html

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 6Json and GitHubA bit more info on Json, using GitHub as a fallback for sheetsThis is part 6 of my Developer’s Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services; this time, we will investigate Json and The GitHub connection.We created a SPA app using Documents as the data source and a document with ReactJS to serve the content.Part 6 - Json and GithubEdge Delivery Services can create an index of published material; one uses a Google sheet/ Microsoft Excel sheet to do this work. Full details here Indexing (www.aem.live)If we provide the blank query index in the notes folder, they are entered into the sheet as shown when Edge Delivery Servies creates published pages.Then the json is produced by the url main--allaboutv2--ddttom.hlx.live/notes/query-index.jsonWe discussed all of this in an earlier article, in part 3.The critical thing to note is the structure of the json returned from the sheet; we can create json from a sheet by creating titles and cell entries like this.This, in turn, will provide simple jsonIn edge delivery services, any json that is provided in the root folder with the path name of header.json is applied to the website. Edge Delivery Services will use these headers for the paths mentioned in the url element. Note the wildcard. Custom HTTP Response Headers (www.aem.live)You may not want to give content authors complete control over the headers; it is a complex subject with wildcarding and key/value entries. I suggest making this a developer's responsibility.If you create a matching headers.json in your code editor and add it to the GitHub root folder, then GitHub will be used if the sheet has yet to be created. The beauty of Edge Delivery services is that if the user is technical and aware of the technique to create their sheet, they can do so, and their version of the json will override the developer-provided one. I use this technique in my development of Edge Delivery Services Projects.I have configuration information in a file named /config/defaults.json in my GitHub.I have kept the generated JSON original layout as if I had created it on a sheet. However, I have changed the type to ‘fallback’ so that I can debug it later.If we need to change things on production without releasing new code, we just have to create a new sheet named defaults with all the information, including the changes and then publish it.Other sheets used in Edge Delivery Services areMetadata (Bulk Metadata (www.aem.live))Redirects (Redirects (www.aem.live))Config (Project Configuration (www.aem.live)) is a particular item in a special folder. It cannot be served on the web and cannot be previewed.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 7Useful ComponentsBlocks I use in my guides.IndexReturntotopBloglistI explain the additional blocks I use in my guides.We discussed Google Sheets/ Excel spreadsheets, Edge Delivery Services automatic conversion to Json, and the ability to create fallbacks in Github.Part 7 - Useful ComponentsIn building this series, I have created three blocks (or components, in old CMS speak) that help provide navigation widgets.Index - provides an expanding index of the topics in the article.Returntotop - provides a back-to-top button when the reader scrolls away from the opening viewport.Bloglist - provides a list of related articles.Each block is designed to be intuitive for the user and easy for the content author, automating the work. The content author just has to place the item in the correct place in the document, as a block fragment, queued in by a table. The code achieves this functionality using vanilla JavaScript, CSS 3 and DOM manipulation; no frameworks or libraries are involved - this is the perfect way to create Edge Delivery Services blocks (components).returntotopI will begin with the simplest one, returntotopThe function makes the "Back to Top" button visible when the user scrolls down over 100 pixels. The page smoothly scrolls back to the top when the button is clicked.This block has two cells: the first one is the block name, and the second is the content. The content is the wording the author wants to use when it is displayed; one may wish to use different phrasing or say it in French; it is up to the content author.As always, create the folder returntotop under the blocks folder, then make two files returntotop.css and returntotop.jsreturntotop.css contains the styling.The returntotop.js contains the code.It adds an event listener to the window object that listens for the scroll event. The button is displayed when the user scrolls down more than 100 pixels (display: 'block'). Otherwise, the button is hidden (display: 'none').indexOnce again, create a folder inside blocks called index and two files, index.css and index.js, in this folder.Index.css should containAnd index.jsThis code creates an interactive webpage index by selecting all header elements (h1 to h6) and the index block. It creates an index header with a clickable arrow and an index content container. The index is built lazily - only when the user first clicks on the index header. Clicking the index header toggles the visibility of the index content and rotates the arrow.The buildIndex function creates a list of links to all headers on the page, indenting them based on their header level (h1, h2, etc.). Each header is given a unique ID, and the index links are created to point to these IDs.FinallybloglistCreate a folder inside blocks called bloglist and then add the two files bloglist.css and bloglist.js.Bloglist.cssThis CSS creates a responsive blog list layout, using CSS Grid for the blog list, with auto-fitting columns. Each blog item is a flex container with a border. Blog images are set to a fixed height with full width. The last modified date is pushed to the bottom with a separator line. On mobile (< 600px), it switches to a single-column layout.The Javascript fileThe Javascript fetches blog data from "/query-index.json", filtering blog items to include only those with "developer-guide" in the path, sorts the filtered items alphabetically by title, generates HTML content for the blog list and inserts the generated content into the DOM.

Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services. Part 8Using AI with Edge Delivery ServicesSo, if you want to use AI with EDS, AKA Helix or FranklinYou will end up with an AI agent that writes Edge Delivery Services code for you, generating code from text or screenshots.I explain how to use AI effectively with Edge Delivery Services.I opened up my useful components.Part 8 - Using AI with Edge Delivery ServicesI constructed this series just as AI became popular, especially for developers creating code. So, I was tempted. I tried writing with AI—this was an abysmal experience, so I had to hand-craft these pieces. You might detect the odd bit of wandering, repeats, and typos. I did have Grammarly on hand to help. I used Cursor.ai to create my examples; they were not generated raw by AI, but AI assisted my programming.Using Claude without trainingLet us see what happens if you jump into Claude and ask for programming code from Claude for Franklin.Now, this is not intelligent. It has no clue what I meant by Franklin. It knows block and accordion and then hallucinates that we want ‘a react component’. No, we don't. We need plain modern JavaScript and CSS3.Perhaps the word Franklin is not working; try againSame answer.Training ClaudeOk, so we need to train Claude. There are three good sources of training material,Adobe Experience Manager (www.aem.live)Developer Guide to Document Authoring with Edge Delivery Services - Part 0 (allabout.network)Your Repo, or perhaps you are starting from scratch GitHub - adobe/aem-boilerplate: Use this repository template for new AEM projects.When I started writing Part 8 (this part), I realised I had not given enough context for an AI to understand what I was doing; therefore, I wrote Part 0 to fill in the gap. I also needed to provide more background for humans.The aem.live site is good and covers the topic well, but it is not something one can feed to an AI.So, I wrote a site scraper that extracts the text elements and links in a site by scraping and caching the web page; it extracts the text elements from a page (ignoring navigation), extracts all links (including navigation), and marks the ones that have been followed. As it goes along, It writes to a text file.The source code for my scraper, which extracts relevant text pieces from an entire siteNodeJs src for a scraper that constructs a document to train AI.And the config.js that informs what to excludeI ran this code against aem.live and Part 0 of this tutorial; it diligently created files that contained the site's essence.Adding the correct parts of your repo to the AI trainingThe final part of the training is the work already done, your repo.The AI should be interested in the blocks you have added to your repo and the base style sheets.I wrote another nodejs app that scans your folders and builds instructable text from CSS, JS, and MD. I believe in using MD files next to blocks to keep documentation within the implementation.NodeJs src for a scanner that collects JS, CSS, and MD.I ran thisnode index.js -i ~/Documents/GitHub/{myrepname} -o ./output -f result.txt -l debugCreating the final training fileI have five more manually created files, which provide context for the machine-generated files.developer-front.txtThis part of the instructions is intended to train an ai in the coding style for an adobe product. The product uses CSS3, modern javascript and DOM manipulation instead of librariesInstructionsEdge Delivery Services (EDS) Overview:EDS is Adobe's serverless platform for fast, scalable web content delivery. Also known as Franklin or Helix. It allows content creators to use familiar tools like Google Docs/Microsoft Word for authoring. The system converts documents to HTML/JSON and serves them via CDN. EDS supports blocks/components for layout and functionality, enabling rapid development and publishing.Key Components:1. Document-based authoring2. Auto-blocking and metadata handling3. JSON generation from spreadsheets4. Redirects and configuration optionsDevelopment Process:1. Content Creation:- Use Google Docs or Microsoft Word- Add metadata tables for page properties- Define blocks using tables in the document2. Preview and Publish:- Use Sidekick tool in document- Preview generates temporary URL- Publish pushes content to production3. Block Development:- Create folder in /blocks with block-name.css and block-name.js files, inside a folder called block-name. e.g. /blocks/example/example.js and /blocks/example/example.css and /blocks/example/README.md- Use vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation- Access block content via classes and data attributes, never ID4. Spreadsheet Usage:- Create spreadsheets for dynamic content or configuration- System automatically converts to JSON- Access via /path/to/spreadsheet.json5. Advanced Development:- Use query-index.json for dynamic content across site- Configure headers, redirects, authentication in .helix folderBlock Development Details:1. CSS:- Use CSS3 features including variables- Create variations with additional classes2. JavaScript:- Export a default function that decorates the block- Use modern browser APIs (fetch, Intersection Observer, etc.)- Avoid external libraries to maintain performance3. HTML Structure:- Blocks wrapped in <div class="blockname-wrapper">- Inner content in <div class="blockname block">Best Practices:1. Performance:- Leverage EDS features for optimal page speed- Minimize external dependencies- Use lazy loading for images and heavy content2. Modularity:- Keep blocks self-contained and reusable- Use block variations for different use cases- Separate concerns (HTML structure, styling, behavior)3. Content Author Experience:- Make block usage intuitive in documents- Provide clear documentation for custom blocks- Use sensible defaults with options for customization4. SEO and Accessibility:- Ensure proper heading structure- Use semantic HTML elements- Provide alt text for images5. Responsive Design:- Design mobile-first, then enhance for larger screens- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts- Implement responsive images with picture elementConfiguration and Advanced Features:1. .helix folder:- Store configuration files (headers, redirects, etc.)- Not publicly accessible2. Spreadsheets and JSON:- query-index for site-wide content index- Use for dynamic content, site configuration- GitHub fallback for spreadsheets3. Authentication:- Configure in .helix/config spreadsheet4. Redirects:- Manage in redirects spreadsheet or GitHub fallback5. Custom HTTP Headers:- Define in headers spreadsheet or GitHub fallbacksystem-block-ai-front.txt# Guide to Creating Blocks in Edge Delivery Services (EDS) or Franklin, HelixBlocks are modular components used in development to create reusable and customizable sections of a webpage.## Block Structure- Each block typically consists of two main files, and an optional third:1. A CSS file (e.g., `blockname.css`) for styling2. A JavaScript file (e.g., `blockname.js`) for functionality3. a README.md for documentationIf asked to create a block, one should always create a README.md alongside it## Key Components of a Block### CSS File- Contains styles specific to the block- Often includes responsive design for different screen sizes- May use CSS variables for theming### JavaScript File- Exports a `decorate` function as the default- The `decorate` function typically:- Manipulates the DOM to create the block's structure- Adds event listeners for interactivity- Fetches data if needed (e.g., from JSON files)- Applies dynamic styling### Markdown File- Contains documentation of use to the developer, maintainer or content author### Common Patterns- Use of `document.createElement` to create elements- Applying classes for styling- Creating nested structures (e.g., for carousels or grids)- Fetching and processing data (often using `fetch` API)- Implementing responsive behavior## Best Practices1. Keep blocks modular and reusable2. Use semantic HTML where possible3. Implement accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)4. Optimize for performance (lazy loading, efficient DOM manipulation)5. Follow a consistent naming convention for classes and IDs## Advanced Features- Some blocks may use external libraries or APIs- Complex blocks may implement lazy loading or infinite scrolling- Interactive blocks often use event delegation for efficiency## Integration- Blocks are typically integrated into a larger project structure- They may interact with a content management system or data layer- Often used in conjunction with a main JavaScript file that handles overall page behaviorThis guide provides a high-level overview of creating blocks in web development. Each block type has its own specific implementation details and requirements.What follows is sample blocks from my GitHub repositorysystem-block-ai-foot.txt##### This is the end of the examplesWhen asked to create anything, if the result is a block, remember to create a README.mdAll js, cs and md files should obey the air-bnb linting style guideuse await rather than .then() for asynch codealways list every line and function in codelib-franklin.js has been renamed aem.js; remember to check this in the generated code and replace it if necessaryFinally, my Readme.txt places them all in the correct order; I have named the result file all.out to remind me it is not just a plain text file. It contains magic.Cat.sh and ReadMe.txtcat aem-live-result.txt system-developer-front.txt developer-guide.txt system-block-ai-front.txt block-ai-result.txt system-block-ai-foot.txt >all.outThis Unix/Linux shell command combines the contents of multiple text files into a single output file. Let's break it down:1. `cat`: This command concatenates (combines) and displays the contents of files.2. The files being combined are:- `aem-live-result.txt`- `system-developer-front.txt`- `developer-guide.txt`- `system-block-ai-front.txt`- `block-ai-result.txt`- `system-block-ai-foot.txt`3. `>`: This is an output redirection operator. It takes the output that would normally be displayed on the screen and instead writes it to a file.4. `all.out` is the name of the output file to which the combined contents of all the input files will be written.So, when you run this command, it will:1. Read the contents of the files in the correct order.2. Concatenating all of their contents.3. Write the combined content to a new file named `all.out`.If `all.out` exists, its contents will be overwritten. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.This takes all of the files Tom Cranstoun created and turns them into an `all.out` file for Claude or other AI.When added as context, this turns Claude into an agent that can create blocks for Adobe Edge Delivery Services (AKA Franklin or Helix)If you want your repo (`block-ai.txt`) or training, you can replace any files except 'system-XXXX--xxx.txt' and rerun.The file all.out is uploaded to Claude, and the question is given again.Claude does the trick, including a README.md for the component.You do not need to create your training files; you can use mine.Here are the links to the Training texts.Training TextsYou can cherry-pick, download the whole lot, or use the file all.out, which contains the magic.With this training, you can also upload images and screenshots into Claude; Claude will then generate complex blocks for you.I took this screenshot from my home screen on Edge (The browser, gosh, don’t you hate the way this industry names things)I pasted into my trained Claude,The first pass was not complete; it said things like​​function createFeaturedStories(stories) {I said, show me the code, and voila.Note that I have trained Claude to use airbnb style guide, which is Adobe’s Linting in the GitHub pipeline; this code will pass the linting test.New taskYou now have an agent that can create Edge Delivery Services Blocks with a prompt and maybe a picture; this is a very handy tool. Remember that it is AI-generated, so Mistakes can happen; check the code.A reminder

This is the Markdown file that generates a fraction of the block named README. path: ~/Documents/GitHub/allaboutV2FranklinAI/blocks/bio/README.md# bio block javascript
The `decorate` function takes a `block` parameter and performs the following steps:
First of all it checks for the class 'hide-author', if not found it performs the task below]
1. It searches for an `<img>` element within an element that has the class `.bio.block`.
2. If the `<img>` element is found and it has a non-empty `alt` attribute, the function extracts the author name from the `alt` attribute.
3. If the author name is not found in the `alt` attribute or if the `<img>` element doesn't exist, the function looks for a `<meta>` tag with the `name` attribute set to `"author"`. If found, it retrieves the author name from the `content` attribute of the `<meta>` tag.
4. The function then creates a new `<strong>` element and sets its text content to the author name.
5. Finally, the function locates the element with the class `.bio.block` and appends the newly created `<strong>` element containing the author name as the last child of the `.bio.block` element.
In essence, this part is responsible for extracting the author name from either the `alt` attribute of an image or the `content` attribute of a `<meta>` tag, and then adding the author name as a `<strong>` element to the end of the element with the class `.bio.block`; if not hidden.
The wrapper is added to the expressions resolver; it obeys the expression {{expand,$NAMESPACE:VARIABLE$})
It is assumed that the $system:enableprofilevariables$ has been set to 'y' and there are meaning profile variables

# Dynamic block JS
This JavaScript code is part Tom Cranstoun derived variations of Helix CMS, with diagrams here <https://main--allaboutv2--ddttom.hlx.live/extra/dynamic>
It defines an asynchronous function named `decorate` that dynamically manipulates web content based on certain conditions. The function is designed to work within a specific block of a webpage, enhancing it with dynamic content fetched from a JSON file.
The file is /query-index.json which is auto-populated by Helix whenever pages are published or deleted
the dynamic pages are selected using one of three different mechanisms:
default is to use /blog/ as a path to find pagesif the current page has more than / in its path, such as /articles/index t5hen the default becomes the pathfinally if there are any classnames in the helix block these are used as paths.
one can use section metadata attribute "maxReturn" to set the maximum number of entries.if no section metadata the code looks for page metadata maxReturnif not found it then looks for "$system:maxreturn$"and finally it uses 8 if they do not exist.
You can pull in the headline, description, 'service' tag, 'resource' tag and url path from the query-index to the card. This will display relevant information about the article and allow a link to the page from the card.
Here's a detailed breakdown:
## ESLint Directives
- **`eslint-disable function-paren-newline, import/extensions, no-alert`**: These lines disable specific ESLint rules for this file, allowing certain code styles that ESLint would normally flag as violations. This customization is common in projects to fit the team's coding style or project's requirements.
## Imports
- **Various elements from `'../../scripts/dom-helpers.js'`**: Functions like `a`, `div`, `li`, `p`, `strong`, `ul` are imported for creating HTML elements programmatically. This approach is typical in modern web development to dynamically generate content.- **`createOptimizedPicture` from `'../../scripts/aem.js'`**: A function designed to create optimized `<picture>` elements for responsive images, a common practice in web performance optimization.- **`ffetch` from `'../../scripts/ffetch.js'`**: a wrapper around the Fetch API, tailored for this project's specific needs for making network requests.
### The `decorate` Function
- **Purpose**: Asynchronously fetches and processes content, then injects this content into a specified block element on the webpage.- **Parameters**:- `block`: The DOM element into which the dynamic content will be inserted.
#### Key Operations
1. **Element Selection**: Finds an element with the class `.dynamic-container` within the document.
2. **Max Return Calculation**: Determines the maximum number of content items to fetch, prioritizing the value of a `data-maxreturn` attribute, followed by system configurations, and defaults to `8` if none are specified.
3. **Content Fetching**: Uses the `ffetch` function to asynchronously retrieve content from `/query-index.json`.
4. **Target Names Initialization**: Sets the default content category to `blog`. It adjusts the target based on the current URL path, excluding the domain.
5. **Additional Targets**: Dynamically adjusts target names based on additional class names of the `block` element, with exclusions for specific patterns.
6. **Content Filtering**: Excludes content paths that contain `/template` or match the current page's path. Further filters the content to include only items that match the specified `targetNames`.
7. **Sorting**: Orders the filtered content by the `lastModified` timestamp in descending order.
8. **Content Injection**: Limits the displayed content based on `maxReturnNumber` and appends it to the `block` element. Each item is structured with an image, title, description, and a "Read More" link.
### Summary
The script is a sophisticated content loader that enhances user experience by dynamically displaying relevant content. It leverages modern JavaScript practices, such as asynchronous data fetching, dynamic content generation, and efficient content filtering and sorting. This approach is particularly effective in content-heavy sites, allowing for a more responsive, tailored user experience.

This code adds a "return to top" button feature to the webpage. Here's how it works:
1. **Button Selection:** It first identifies the button element on the webpage that is intended to return the user to the top of the page. This button is marked with a specific class.
2. **Scroll Event Handling:** The code listens for when the user scrolls up or down on the page. If the user scrolls down more than 100 pixels, the button is made visible. If the user scrolls back up so that they are within 100 pixels from the top, the button is hidden.
3. **Button Click Behavior:** When the visible button is clicked, the page smoothly scrolls back to the top. This gives users a quick and easy way to return to the top of the page without having to manually scroll back up.

This code imports a function called `renderExpressions` from a JavaScript module located at "/plusplus/plugins/expressions/src/expressions.js". It then defines and exports a default function named `decorate` which takes a parameter called `block`.
Inside the `decorate` function, it selects an element with the class name 'text-wrapper' using `document.querySelector`. It then passes this selected element to the `renderExpressions` function, which presumably processes and renders expressions within that element.
In summary, this code snippet is responsible for decorating a specific block of content by rendering expressions within an element that has the class 'text-wrapper', utilizing the imported `renderExpressions` function from an external module.
This will just display text, but if any expressions are included it wil execute them
see <https://github.com/vtsaplin/franklin-expressions/>
Only one expression has been defined in clientExpressions.js {{expand,'$NAMESPACE:VARIABLE$}}
This one command expands the variable as text.
Create your own expressions in clientExpressions.js

# AI Assistant Guide for Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS) Development
As an expert AI assistant specializing in Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS), also known as Helix or Franklin, your primary responsibility is to assist developers in creating, explaining, and optimizing code for EDS projects. You must follow EDS-specific best practices and conventions.
## Core EDS Concepts
1. **Document-based authoring:** Content is authored using Google Docs or Microsoft Word.2. **Serverless architecture:** Focus on performance and scalability.3. **GitHub integration:** Code is stored and synced via GitHub repositories.4. **Block-based development:** Blocks are key components for functionality and styling.5. **Modern web technologies:** Use vanilla JavaScript and CSS3. Avoid external libraries unless necessary.6. **Responsive design:** Apply a mobile-first approach to all components.7. **Accessibility and SEO:** These should always be prioritized.8. **E-L-D loading pattern:** Use Eager, Lazy, and Delayed loading for performance.
## Project Structure
```shell/├── blocks/│ ├── header/│ │ ├── header.css│ │ └── header.js│ └── footer/│ ├── footer.css│ └── footer.js├── scripts/│ ├── aem.js│ └── scripts.js├── styles/│ └── styles.css├── tools/│ └── sidekick/│ └── config.json├── 404.html├── 500.html├── head.html├── helix-query.yaml├── helix-sitemap.yaml└── fstab.yaml```
## Block Development Guidelines
### File Structure:
Each block should have its own directory:
```/blocks/blockname/├── blockname.js├── blockname.css└── README.md```
### CSS File (`blockname.css`)
- Focus on styles specific to the block.- Implement a responsive design using CSS variables for theming.```css.blockname {/* Base styles */}
.blockname__element {/* Element styles */}
@media (max-width: 768px) {/* Responsive styles */}```
### JavaScript File (`blockname.js`)
- Export a `decorate` function as default.- Structure the function to handle DOM manipulation, event listeners, data fetching, and dynamic styling.- Use async/await for asynchronous tasks.
```javascriptexport default async function decorate(block) {const container = document.createElement('div');block.appendChild(container);
container.addEventListener('click', () => {// Interaction logic});
try {const response = await fetch('/path/to/data.json');if (!response.ok) {throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);}const data = await response.json();updateBlockWithData(container, data);} catch (error) {displayErrorMessage(container);}
block.classList.add('blockname--initialized');}
function updateBlockWithData(container, data) {// Update the block with fetched data}
function displayErrorMessage(container) {// Display an error message in the block}```
### README.md
Include the following:1. Block name and description2. Usage instructions3. Configuration options4. Variations with examples5. Dependencies6. Accessibility notes7. Performance considerations8. Author/version details
## Best Practices
1. **Modularity:** Keep blocks self-contained and reusable.2. **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate elements to ensure structured content.3. **Accessibility:** Implement ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.4. **Performance:** Prioritize performance using lazy loading and efficient DOM manipulation.5. **Naming Conventions:** Use consistent and descriptive class/ID names.6. **Responsive Design:** Ensure adaptability to various screen sizes.7. **Error Handling:** Implement graceful error handling.8. **Code Style:** Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide for clean, maintainable code.9. **Async Operations:** Use async/await consistently for asynchronous tasks.
## Advanced Features
- Lazy loading of images/content- Infinite scrolling for content-heavy blocks- API integration- Complex animations and transitions- State management for interactive blocks
## Supporting Developers
1. Provide functional, complete code snippets.2. Explain every significant function and block of code.3. Consider performance implications and suggest optimizations.4. Balance performance with a good content authoring experience.5. Adapt suggestions based on project-specific needs.
## Spreadsheet Usage
- Use spreadsheets for dynamic content or configuration. The system converts them to JSON.- Access content via `/path/to/spreadsheet.json`.
## Advanced Development
- Use `query-index.json` for dynamic site-wide content.- Configure headers, redirects, and authentication using the `.helix` folder.
## Block Development Details
1. **CSS:** Use CSS3 and variables. Create variations using additional classes.2. **JavaScript:** Use modern browser APIs like fetch and Intersection Observer.3. **HTML Structure:** Wrap blocks in `<div class="blockname-wrapper">`. Inner content resides in `<div class="blockname block">`.
## Key EDS Features
1. **Performance:** Leverage EDS features for optimal page speed. Minimize external dependencies and lazy-load heavy content.2. **Modularity:** Keep blocks self-contained and reusable. Use variations for different scenarios. Separate concerns (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).3. **Author Experience:** Make block usage intuitive. Provide documentation. Offer sensible defaults with customizability.4. **SEO & Accessibility:** Ensure proper heading structures, use semantic HTML, and add alt text to images.5. **Responsive Design:** Design mobile-first, then enhance for larger screens using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
## Configuration and Advanced Features
1. **`.helix` folder:** Stores configuration files for headers, redirects, and authentication. It's not publicly accessible.2. **Spreadsheets and JSON:** Use `query-index` for site-wide content and dynamic configurations. GitHub acts as a fallback for spreadsheets.3. **Authentication:** Managed in the `.helix/config` spreadsheet.4. **Redirects and HTTP Headers:** Managed via spreadsheets or GitHub fallback.
Always strive to create efficient, well-documented code that aligns with EDS/Helix/Franklin development standards. Adapt block structure based on project requirements, consistently using async/await, and provide clear, functional examples to developers. Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide unless specified otherwise.if writing code that uses console output, remember to precede it with // eslint-disable-next-line no-console

Adobe EDS: Revolutionising Content Management
The new Document Centred Content Management system
In digital publishing, the quest for the ideal content management system (CMS) is ongoing.Subject Matter Experts create original content with word processors and spreadsheets, passing these documents through an approval process. When content is finally approved (and this can take a long time in regulated industries) is then passed to Content Authors to copy/paste sub-edit into the CMS for publishing.Content Authors actually dislike CMS systems. The Content team receives original marketing text and fragments in Word/Excel documents from Subject Matter Experts (SME’s), which in regulated environments have been approved by Legal. The content team then are forced to use “components”, and “templates”, created by technicians; using “page properties” and dialog boxes to pull the whole piece together; they have to sub-edit the copy; because it often won’t fit in the constraints of the CMS. They then, often, have to back port the content to the original document format as a system of record. Returning the document to the SME with a link to the final web-page page.
Product Owners dislike CMS systems, especially in regulated industries. They have to get approval for every line of text they place on the web. Regulated industries like Pharmaceuticals, Automobile makers, and Insurers etc are legally bound to the content they publish and the corporations requirement is incredibly strict. One product owner I know of actually asked that the entire CMS be driven by pre-approved excel spreadsheets; however the technicians have built the components and templates around dialog boxes. He too had to use the copy paste methodology.Enter Adobe Franklin/Edge Delivery Services, a system that stands out for its innovative approach to web publishing, promising to redefine efficiency and simplicity in the industry. With the Digital Domain Franklin Accelerator and processes, this system is not just another CMS—it's a game-changer.
What is Adobe Doing?
Adobe Franklin/ Edge Delivery Services is a cutting-edge document based CMS, named in tribute to Rosalind Franklin, whose work was crucial in deciphering DNA's structure. It has undergone a transformation from the "Helix" concept to the current "Edge Delivery Services," signifying its growth from a rudimentary tool to a comprehensive digital content management solution. It has shared all three names in its lifetime, Franklin, Helix and now Edge Delivery services. I’ll continue to call it Franklin for ease. My ease. Sorry Adobe marketing people.
Why This Matters
The significance of Edge Delivery services lies in its serverless architecture, which eliminates the complexities of server management, offering a seamless experience for content creators. It integrates effortlessly with tools that users are already familiar with, making content editing and management as intuitive as using everyday office applications.

Structuring Context for Effective AI Development
Tools like Cursor.ai are changing how we approach coding tasks. One crucial aspect of leveraging AI in development is providing the proper context. In this post, we'll explore the three-tiered structure for creating context in Cursor.ai, ensuring your AI assistant has all the information it needs to be a valuable coding partner.
The Three-Tiered Context Structure
When working with Cursor.ai, it's essential to structure your context to provide comprehensive information to the AI. This structure typically consists of three levels:
1. Top Level: The Context File
At the highest level, we have the context file. This file is the foundation, providing a broad overview of your project's technical landscape. It typically includes:
The framework you're using
Details about the development environment
Any specific tools, libraries, or techniques that are crucial to the project
This file gives AI a general understanding of the technological ecosystem within which it works.
2. Second Level: .cursorrules
The .cursorrules file acts as a bridge between the general context and specific tasks. It outlines:
Project-specific requirements
Coding standards and best practices
Any constraints or guidelines that need to be followed
This file helps ensure the AI's output aligns with your project's specific needs and standards.
3. Bottom Level: Prompt for Cursor Composer
At the most granular level, we have the prompt sent to Cursor Composer. This is where you specify:
The exact task you want the AI to perform
Any specific details or parameters for the task
Desired output format or style
This prompt is tailored to each coding task, allowing you to leverage the AI's capabilities for a wide range of development needs.
Best Practices for Context Creation
To make the most of this structure, consider the following tips:
Be Comprehensive Yet Concise: Provide enough detail at each level to give the AI a clear understanding, but avoid overwhelming it with unnecessary information.
Update Regularly: As your project evolves, update your context file and .cursorrules to reflect any changes in your development environment or requirements.
Be Specific in Your Prompts. The more precise your task descriptions, the better the AI can assist you.
Iterate and Refine: Pay attention to the AI's outputs and refine your context and prompts based on the results you receive.
By following this structured approach to context creation in Cursor.ai, you can significantly enhance the effectiveness of AI-assisted development in your projects. Remember, providing clear, relevant information at each level is key, enabling the AI to be a more valuable and accurate coding companion.
